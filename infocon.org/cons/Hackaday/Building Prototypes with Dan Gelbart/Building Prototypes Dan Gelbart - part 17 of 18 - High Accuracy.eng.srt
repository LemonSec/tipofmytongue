1
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,559
okay so now let's talk a few minutes

2
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:15,360
about how high accuracy parts so the

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,539
part even after finish machining looks

4
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,310
beautiful but it's actually not accurate

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,970
and and I was saying of it if you have

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,400
some moving parts sliding against each

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,000
other if you build them just from

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,340
machined parts you know say machined on

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,410
a milling machine overlays you'll find

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,630
out that pretty soon they'll wear out

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,239
and there will be some play and to

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,760
understand wise it is all that you have

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,329
to do is take apart and mill it as

14
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,950
finely as you can on a milling machine

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,500
so this was done at a very slow feed and

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,590
a very shallow cut finishing cut and it

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,410
looks very beautiful but actually when

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,020
this maids another part it's only

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,780
touching a few high spots and the way

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,360
you can demonstrate it quite simply is

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,920
you can take one of those dry erase

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,740
markers so you can color the whole

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,140
surface and the special fluids for this

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,020
purpose are special paints used for

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,990
detecting flatness but just for a quick

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,720
test it can mark the whole surface and

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,150
then you can slide it against the

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,950
granite plate which is very accurate and

29
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,460
tea to your surprise actually it's not

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,740
touching anywhere it's only touching at

31
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,890
this corner and at this corner and one

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,110
spot at this corner because it's only

33
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,770
touching where the ink will off the

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,010
market well off now what this means that

35
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,780
if you made an assembly from this part

36
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,150
which has to move as soon as these few

37
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,150
high spots will wear off the path will

38
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,960
be loose and that's a problem is all

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,330
assemblies that if you are not if they

40
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,890
are not done properly they may seem

41
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,750
accurate but they lose accuracy very

42
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,470
quickly now if you can make it touch on

43
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,909
the whole surface it will not wear for

44
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:14,519
two reasons the first reason there's

45
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,829
just a lot more surface area its resting

46
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:19,409
on so there's a lot more material to

47
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,299
wear away but that's not the main reason

48
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:24,120
the main reason is that if something is

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,330
a perfect flat surface and you lubricate

50
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,350
it

51
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,690
it will act hydrodynamically there will

52
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,330
be an oil film and the metal will

53
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,850
actually not touch the other metal and

54
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,860
there will be zero wear so if the

55
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,260
surface becomes perfectly flat and it's

56
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,870
lubricated the wear doesn't go down a

57
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,240
bit it goes three to zero and that's

58
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,120
very important to understand okay so

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,220
first how do we make it a really flat

60
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,370
surface so the answer is very simple on

61
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,160
small parts like this you have two

62
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,870
choices you can either lap it or scrape

63
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,290
it on big party or give one choice you

64
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,170
can lap you have to scrape because if

65
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,570
you have a big base it's too big and too

66
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,880
heavy to lift and lap you have to scrape

67
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,240
now there is an intermediate step which

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,430
improves the accuracy of the machining

69
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,400
and that self is grinding if I put it on

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,540
a surface grinder

71
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,350
I can grind it will be much better now

72
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,230
the reason why surface grinding produces

73
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,480
a better accuracy not just a nicer

74
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,200
looking surface but a better accuracy is

75
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,060
because there is a lot less forces

76
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,800
between the cutting tool and the

77
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,110
workpiece and a lot less forces in

78
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,300
clamping so reason why this is not

79
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,550
accurate is a is a milling machine is

80
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,070
not so accurate but when I claim to it I

81
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,380
distort it and once I take it out of

82
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,580
clamping it swings back

83
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,220
now since surface grinding uses much

84
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,290
smaller forces I don't need to clamp it

85
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,750
as hard and also the cutting tool

86
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,600
doesn't distort it so basically there

87
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,540
are three steps you can machine it which

88
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,550
is this you can go to an intermediate

89
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,830
step which is grind it on the surface

90
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,360
grinding off the cylinder on a

91
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,090
cylindrical grinder but it's still not

92
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,250
accurate enough if I do the same test on

93
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,780
the surface grind there it will still

94
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,089
only touch it a few spots it's not going

95
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,190
to touch it the whole area the only way

96
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,620
to get you touch of the whole area is by

97
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,840
lapping of scraping so the only way to

98
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,520
make a machine which is not only

99
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,630
accurate but stays accurate forever on

100
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,260
moving parts is by lapping or scraping

101
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,710
okay so in order to bring the surface to

102
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,169
a full bearing area surface

103
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,479
as we said you can either lap it up

104
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,340
scrape it so the small parts are easiest

105
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,219
fastest to lap and what lapping means is

106
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:52,650
moving it in a randomized motion on an

107
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,560
abrasive surface so first you have to

108
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,279
clean a granite surface plate okay

109
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,889
because any kind of dirt behind it which

110
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:05,999
will change the flatness is to stick a

111
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:08,840
sheet of emery clothes or emery paper

112
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,360
now it usually it helps to put a drop of

113
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,550
water if you just pull down and stick so

114
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,729
if you just put the drop of water and

115
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,460
squeeze out the water and make it stick

116
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,819
okay now this is 220 grit that's kind of

117
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:31,529
a typical grit you would use if you want

118
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:33,120
to remove a lot of material you can

119
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,639
start with a 180 grit if you want to

120
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,349
remove a little material you can go

121
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:39,990
straight away to 400 grit but somewhere

122
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,419
in that range is good you can do a try

123
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,719
and well you can see it

124
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:48,060
it's a rough grit so it takes off a lot

125
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,759
of the red but it still only laps a few

126
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,129
spots now the trick is is your lap in a

127
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:56,310
figure 8 motion and you don't lean on

128
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,620
one corner unless you want to correct it

129
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,750
you can correct lap parallelism by

130
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,219
leaning on the corner what if you don't

131
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:04,439
want to do any you don't want to collect

132
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,689
anything just lap you try to uniformly

133
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:12,449
press it go in a figure 8 maybe turn it

134
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:20,310
over turn it over again until the whole

135
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,430
surface looks dull and if you want it

136
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,050
really accurate you have to remove all

137
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,149
machining marks here I can still see

138
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:29,909
machining marks so a little bit more

139
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:34,789
lapping because it wasn't so accurate

140
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,380
now the danger in lapping is rounding it

141
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,260
because if you walk it around so if it's

142
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,630
very critical you sometimes attach to

143
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,150
dummy pieces just to give you a wider

144
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,060
bearing and you lap it together

145
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,490
another thing you do if you make parts

146
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,800
which have to be mated by lapping you

147
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,050
can relieve the middle so there's less

148
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,110
material to lap but the parts don't have

149
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,210
to slide we just have to fit perfectly

150
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,370
it's enough to have some four spots or

151
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,160
just two ribs so you remove all the

152
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,370
extra material let's tie clip okay so

153
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:19,280
now now it's left okay now we can repeat

154
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,790
the same test right here clean the plate

155
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:30,710
and do the test with a Marquis oh okay

156
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,990
just it's not paint perfectly but we can

157
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,640
see already gravity bit now you see the

158
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,240
result okay so basically it removed all

159
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,300
the marking now as I said them if you

160
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,070
want higher accuracy you can't rely on

161
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,620
this marker it's too cold you have to

162
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,240
use a better method and there are

163
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,260
special marking inks marking paste to

164
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,810
see exactly what's going on now another

165
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,210
way to know what's going on if you rub

166
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,780
it the high spots will become shiny so

167
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,130
actually all you have to do it don't

168
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,500
need any market at all you just need to

169
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,360
hold it and tilt it and look for the

170
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,600
shiny area so it's a mango I'll just

171
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,750
tilt it until you see shiny area okay

172
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,330
and now you can see the shiny area is

173
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,360
about half of the surface area because

174
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,400
he'll still have machining America still

175
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,820
low so if I continue letting the Chinese

176
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,330
I will spread until it's all shiny and

177
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,030
at this point it has full area bearing

178
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,940
and full area bearing means not only

179
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,500
that it's precise that it will never

180
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,789
wear out as I demonstrate later okay now

181
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:44,179
so this is lapping if you wanted to lap

182
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:46,880
a hole say like this you'll make

183
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,680
yourself a split lip

184
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,440
you can put the paper around this and

185
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,380
let it there's different sized split

186
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,600
left to let holes if you wanted to let

187
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,970
the outside of something you'll make

188
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,300
yourself a split external lap and again

189
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,350
you'll put say Emery clothes in it if I

190
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,980
wanted to do that I would take semi

191
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,279
clothes like this I would run it so the

192
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:25,100
split lip just to hold it a slot is just

193
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,010
to hold it then I would run the piece I

194
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,570
want two laps which put it in the lathe

195
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,910
let it turn and go back and forth now

196
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,040
the interview seeing is going in two

197
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,470
directions because going to directions

198
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,750
is what randomize is it so if I want to

199
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,640
lap a seal in there it's not enough to

200
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,230
leave it in one spot it just make

201
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,930
grooves you have to keep going in two

202
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,089
directions and and this is the reason

203
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,550
why some shapes are how to lap if you

204
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,950
have a co taper you cannot lap it easily

205
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,470
because you can't go in two directions

206
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,360
you can send it a bit cosmetically but

207
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,589
it wouldn't become of accurate because

208
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:03,320
you can't let it only only shapes which

209
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,029
can be moved in two directions can be

210
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:07,910
left so say a sphere can be left because

211
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,440
you can walk in two directions the

212
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,450
cylinder can be left the flat can be

213
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,350
left other things can be left if you go

214
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,300
in one direction but it's less effective

215
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,820
like a thread or a taper it's problem

216
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,740
slapping it say taper you can have a

217
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,930
little segment and slide it along the

218
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,339
table but it's harder to let okay and

219
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:30,410
this is tightly related to term called

220
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,650
honing hole a hole is like a single

221
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,540
exist which is has a stone only the

222
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,760
grinding stone and acting as a lecture

223
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,440
but especially the same technology

224
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,570
honing and lapping just laughing usually

225
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,450
uses a paste or alleging field okay

226
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,640
something very important about letting

227
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,380
if you leper soft materials a luminal or

228
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,040
brass you can have particles embedded in

229
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,320
the soft material and then the soft

230
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,560
material itself will act as a lap so if

231
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,209
you had a bronze part and

232
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:05,149
stealing part and you left both to make

233
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:07,999
a bearing and if these particles get

234
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:10,040
embedded in the soft material like bonds

235
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,079
the bonds material itself will become a

236
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,970
permanent left and keep letting the

237
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,220
steel so it's very very important to

238
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,110
make sure particles don't get embedded

239
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,199
so if you have a blunt part don't push

240
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:24,350
too hard and the safest way to do is to

241
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,259
use a software lapping material which

242
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:30,319
cannot embed in bonds so there are so

243
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:32,929
this regular Emily in regular lapping

244
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:35,449
compounds are really good for steel okay

245
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:38,149
so this is a regular lapping compound

246
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:40,670
that's already a powder mixed in grease

247
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,949
that you can smear on the shaft and lap

248
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:46,459
a steel shaft a 400 grit which is like

249
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,920
the common lapping now this is a special

250
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,040
epic compound it says yellow label for

251
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,129
soft materials only and this is a softer

252
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,439
grit which doesn't embed in the soft

253
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:00,499
materials so if you do have to lap soft

254
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:03,709
materials with regular compound make

255
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,420
sure we don't rest too hard that they

256
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,079
don't embed in the soft material okay

257
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,809
the other way to achieve high accuracy

258
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:17,089
besides lapping is called scraping and

259
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:18,920
the advantage of scrapings that you

260
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,079
don't have to move the part and move it

261
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:23,029
around and that's suitable for big

262
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,910
structures so scraping is based on

263
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,279
touching the surface with a plate with a

264
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,549
reference surface and looking at the

265
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,649
high spot and in this case I can just

266
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:35,709
see the high spot by the reflection and

267
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:39,860
then removing the high spots with a tool

268
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,529
and the tool is very simple it's

269
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,689
basically a bit like this chisel I

270
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:46,699
showed you before I can use the scraper

271
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,240
its ground either 90 degrees or

272
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,949
sometimes just a bit less than 90 but

273
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:53,689
most of time it's gone flat at 90

274
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,619
degrees and what you do is you look at

275
00:12:57,619 --> 00:13:00,259
the high spots and you simply remove

276
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:05,269
them exist it just peels off a very very

277
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:08,360
thin layer of metal and you go in one

278
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,540
direction

279
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:14,360
and then you go in the other direction

280
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:27,850
typically okay and then you test the lit

281
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,870
after you have done that you rub it

282
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,230
again look at it again and the high

283
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,060
spots move somewhere else because he

284
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,029
removed them so you repeat it and you do

285
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,170
that for many many times until the high

286
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,110
spots are spread everywhere okay

287
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,660
now this sounds very tedious actually

288
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,120
these what helps is there is a power

289
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,220
scrape where an electric scraper which

290
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,170
can do it okay so if you have to scrape

291
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,389
large areas like a base of a machine

292
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,519
it's too slow to do it by hand so if you

293
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,259
use a power scraper like this one

294
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,810
now you check it again okay so this is a

295
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,589
new high spot and Yuri scrape it 90

296
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:42,259
degrees to the original direction so I

297
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,410
see the original scraping marks and I

298
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,189
see some high spots here so just to get

299
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:52,240
a better surface

300
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:04,889
okay

301
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:07,470
yeah and now the high spots start

302
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,600
spreading everywhere this is obviously

303
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,490
done too quickly to be accurate but you

304
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,040
can see where I scraped now with random

305
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,170
high spots where I didn't scrape there's

306
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,209
two big high spots so I would have to

307
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,069
continue scraping until the whole

308
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:21,839
surface is covered with the univille

309
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,779
density of high spots if you look at a

310
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,480
high precision machine tools as they all

311
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,839
have this surface if you look at regular

312
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,940
machine tools they have a fake scraped

313
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,759
surface what they do they grind the

314
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,360
surface and then they do a surface which

315
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,910
is sometimes added on top of scraping to

316
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:49,069
retain oil so if you look at this I see

317
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,029
so you look at less precise tools they

318
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:02,999
have like a fake surface but you can see

319
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:04,980
the grinding marks below it that it's

320
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,139
not really scraped because people

321
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,699
traditionally are looking for this

322
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,040
appearance on high quality machine tools

323
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,779
okay so now that we fix the surface to

324
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:19,429
achieve full bearing I mentioned before

325
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:22,170
the significance of full bearing is

326
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,660
double first it's more accurate of

327
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,100
course it doesn't walk it sits

328
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,790
accurately secondly it's more it's

329
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,189
stiffer because if I put a load on it

330
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:34,709
it's not resting on one point which can

331
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,439
squeeze it can bear a heavy load is much

332
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:40,470
higher stiffness and the third thing is

333
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,629
that it will not wear if it's lubricated

334
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:44,819
now the reason why it will not wear

335
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:47,519
because two perfect planes with

336
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,189
lubricant will become hydrodynamic very

337
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:53,129
very quickly so if it was lubricated and

338
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,980
I moved it it will actually not touch

339
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,379
each other there'll be a soil film which

340
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,300
will separate them and then will be zero

341
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,329
wear and you can demonstrate it very

342
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:05,490
nicely when you look at any one of the

343
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,339
new hard drive spindles the old hard

344
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,679
drive spindles use ball bearings and you

345
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,929
have Drive spindles all you sleeve

346
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:15,779
bearings but are very accurate and they

347
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:17,250
are designed to operate hydro

348
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,529
dynamically so if you look at the light

349
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:23,099
bulb the light bulb is on and I have one

350
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,230
wire connected to the case of the hard

351
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,359
drive and another wire connected to a

352
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,169
finger which is touching the spindle so

353
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:33,179
right now it shows electrical contact

354
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,700
between the case in the spindle but as

355
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,799
soon as I spin it it loses all

356
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,399
electrical contact okay and and the fact

357
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:43,440
it loses electrical contact means it

358
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,539
will never wear that's a significance of

359
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:46,950
it because if there's no electrical

360
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,419
contact there's no metal to metal

361
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,760
contact if there is no metal metal

362
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,640
contact how can it wail so indeed a

363
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,090
properly designed spindle like this will

364
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,090
run forever without wear and today's are

365
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,740
also using this idea in the computer

366
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,289
fans too that there aren't quieter more

367
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:07,200
accurately in everywhere another demo

368
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,920
that you achieve I

369
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,250
the dynamic lubrication very quickly

370
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,950
you say this is a granite square which

371
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,020
is very flat and a granite table which

372
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,930
is very flat so usually tends to stick

373
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,000
to each other but as soon as you move it

374
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,160
a bit it can become hydrodynamic very

375
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,300
quickly just float frictionlessly okay

376
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,550
and the reason it floats frictionlessly

377
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,040
because he also air has very very low

378
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,880
viscosity if the surfaces are perfect it

379
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,220
doesn't take much of a velocity to

380
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,610
become hydrodynamic because the load is

381
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,430
distributed over the whole area if the

382
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,860
whole area is perfect the load is

383
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,860
distributed on every point so at no

384
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,710
point is a high pressure if the surface

385
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,380
is not perfect the load is resting on a

386
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,780
few points at those points as high

387
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,970
pressure it means it will need a much

388
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,460
higher velocity to get hydrodynamic

389
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,100
conditions because they to achieve

390
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,860
either dynamic lift it's a function as

391
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,810
you see on the equation it's a function

392
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,080
of the viscosity and the force and this

393
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,930
and the speed okay so for a given force

394
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,240
in a given viscosity you need a certain

395
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,120
speed to become a dynamic and air has

396
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,300
very low viscosity but since the area

397
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,380
here is very very large the force per

398
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,390
unit area of the pressure is very very

399
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,670
small so in spite of the low viscosity

400
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,670
of air this becomes hydrodynamic at very

401
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,560
low speed and the same poses another

402
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,750
subject when you talk about building

403
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,540
precision equipment is how do you

404
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,270
determine that it's precise like it's

405
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,550
very easy for a flap I just showed you

406
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,320
can rub it against the grain it look at

407
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,900
it you know it's flat but what about if

408
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,240
this had to be right angles perfect

409
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,580
right angles so again if you have a

410
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,220
granny square like this it's easy

411
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,680
because that surface is already known

412
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,170
flat now you can have it against the

413
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,420
granite and now you can look at the

414
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,750
contact of this surface now the question

415
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,370
is how do you get it Square and first

416
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,370
place so if you have a very very

417
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,340
accurate square vise on a milling

418
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,170
chin you can clamp it on a grinder you

419
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,600
can rely on device and make it square if

420
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,190
you are not sure you have a very

421
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,710
accurate square vise the best thing is

422
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,900
clamp it to something known very square

423
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,510
for example if I wanted to get this very

424
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,790
square to that very square meaning to

425
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,780
one micron or better what I would do is

426
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,960
I would take something that I know is

427
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,270
square like this bow which is square to

428
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,870
submicron okay I would clamp it to this

429
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,690
bar and put this whole thing down on the

430
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,520
surface grinder or a milling machine and

431
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,190
then I will take this cut and then I

432
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,990
know it's square and then I'll just let

433
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,750
it to get it flat so now I have two

434
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,000
areas now to get it parallel it's very

435
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,820
easy okay because now you have one sides

436
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,240
you can just turn it over and drying it

437
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,980
on the surface going there and then lap

438
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,100
it now when you want to get it parallel

439
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,590
you can fix small levels by lepak by

440
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,480
hand lapping say if you put it under a

441
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,750
dial gauge and you discover there is an

442
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,580
error with parallelism one side is a

443
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,710
micron higher than the other side all

444
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,600
you have to do is lean on it a bit when

445
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,640
you lap it on the higher side so instead

446
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,170
of pushing in the middle you push it

447
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,600
here you develop this feel very quickly

448
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,320
that as you move the load point you move

449
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,080
the tilt so very quickly you can change

450
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,850
the pressure and let it parallel to a

451
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,980
mic on so now it's square and parallel

452
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,270
to a micron now other things that you

453
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,920
want to check if you want to check

454
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,190
around nests typically you have to

455
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,960
separate of course run out from

456
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,060
roundness whether if you make a perfect

457
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,790
spindle the spindle may have run out

458
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,370
because you things are not mounted well

459
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,530
but it's still tunis of rotation is

460
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,350
there so so far our spindle is two specs

461
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,270
that is run out and the stone is of

462
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,760
audacious around this and you can

463
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,680
separate them for example one way to

464
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,450
separate them is you can take a ball or

465
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,220
a perfect cylinder mounted on the

466
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,190
spindle and take two probes at right

467
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,040
angles and now you have two signals and

468
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,900
and because you have two independent

469
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,390
signals and you have two unknowns

470
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,370
because one man was running out

471
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,190
as wellness if you can have two

472
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,200
equations two inputs and then you can

473
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,440
find both separately so this actually

474
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,040
leads to a more generic principle which

475
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,070
is known as reversal methods and the

476
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,140
reversal methods it's a interesting

477
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,000
principle because you can expand this

478
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,220
concept to many many measurements in

479
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,590
precision and it's actually very hard to

480
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,870
find it in any textbook so I'll just

481
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:03,200
explain in general reversal methods and

482
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,809
then we can show some examples how it's

483
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:08,750
used so the basic question in metrology

484
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:13,330
is let's say you want to measure how

485
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,670
straightest is or how round something is

486
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,070
or how square something is but you don't

487
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,950
have a reference if you had a perfect

488
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,260
reference like this you could see how

489
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,910
straight this is just by touching it to

490
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,250
the reference but how do you measure

491
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,380
this if you don't have a perfect

492
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,290
reference okay so it turns out it's very

493
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:37,240
easy it turns out you can measure the

494
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,800
straightness of this or the flatness of

495
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,480
this or the roundness without having a

496
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,510
reference and the way you do that you

497
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,880
use something called a reversal method

498
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,460
so let's say you have one straight edge

499
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,190
which is unknown and another straight

500
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,270
edge you want to measure need neither of

501
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,450
them you know anything about okay so

502
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:06,110
what you do is you you measure actually

503
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,940
this this could be the other safe let

504
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,470
the table could be the other edge

505
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,880
although you don't know anything about

506
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,790
it you don't know if it's flat or not

507
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,610
okay so what you do is you take a dial

508
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:22,960
gauge and you set it up to scan here and

509
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,679
you move it we put something here to fix

510
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,380
a trajectory so let's say you move it

511
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,130
and you write down the reading every

512
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,970
centimeter okay so you have a function f

513
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,500
of X which is this is X you have the ydv

514
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,400
ation for any X but you don't know

515
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,140
whether the Y deviation

516
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,240
came from this or from this or both

517
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,500
because you don't know anything a lot

518
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,100
either okay however what you can do is

519
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:01,250
you can take this part flip it over flip

520
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,070
it over and now measure it from

521
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:08,720
underneath flip over the gauge and you

522
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,520
set it up here that the gauge will go

523
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,880
underneath will fit which it doesn't

524
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,770
know and you scan it again but

525
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,650
underneath and same thing this has to

526
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,600
move on the same trajectory you you line

527
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,160
up and you make it move the same

528
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,620
trajectory as before okay so if if this

529
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,980
surface was an unknown and this was an

530
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,060
unknown and let's call it f of X Y is f

531
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,720
of X and let's call this G of X let's

532
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,230
say okay so when you measured it when

533
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:47,570
when the original surface was up okay so

534
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,510
the total measurement you got let's say

535
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,790
that it is the sum its al-bakr you can

536
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,140
call it sum or difference so now when

537
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,200
you measured it you got f of X plus of G

538
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,500
of X as a function of X now when you

539
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:06,530
invert it you now have G of X minus f of

540
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,590
X because you inverted this so now you

541
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,620
have two independent equations for each

542
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,900
point so basically for each point here

543
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,220
you have a EV of X plus G of X and f of

544
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,270
X minus G of X now if you have two

545
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,850
unknowns F and G in two equations you

546
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,610
can solve it so now you end up with a

547
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,820
function your end up with two functions

548
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,040
by taking the sum and the difference of

549
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,170
the functions you can separate f of X

550
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,020
and G of X so although this is unknown

551
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,150
and this is unknown but you have two

552
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,070
separate equations you can resolve

553
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,460
separately f of X and G of X what the

554
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,140
interesting that these two don't have to

555
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,670
be the same height exactly because

556
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,890
that's another unknown if these are not

557
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,770
on the same height you'll just introduce

558
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,670
a tilt arrow so when you look at the two

559
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,810
functions

560
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,600
so you will see that one function came

561
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,050
out that it has a tilt arrow but you can

562
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,660
always remove the fixed term the team

563
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,770
table because when you talk about

564
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,750
straightness the till doesn't mean

565
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,090
anything all it means is one point

566
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,260
relative to the other

567
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,080
so actually you don't even have to match

568
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,870
those the arrow between those we just

569
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,480
will show up that is a function the

570
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,600
graph will have a tilt which you remove

571
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,310
okay so this whole idea is called the

572
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,970
reversal method that you have two

573
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,610
unknowns or many unknowns but you have

574
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,830
enough independent equations to resolve

575
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,020
it and this is one of the more powerful

576
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,780
concept in precision instruments and

577
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,720
metrology and basically this is how you

578
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,450
separate roundness from one out when you

579
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,520
measure a spindle this is how you

580
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,670
measure straightness and this this is

581
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,250
how a circle is divided accurately

582
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,830
because you know in a circle is divided

583
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,950
accurately the division has to close

584
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,960
right because if you have all the angles

585
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,240
have to add up to 360 so if it doesn't

586
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,800
close you know you have an arrow and

587
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,450
then you can do multiple measurements

588
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,420
and find out where they are all is okay

589
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,310
so this whole concept of reversal

590
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,070
methods can be expanded to many many

591
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,280
tests in metrology to determine how

592
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,300
accurate things are
