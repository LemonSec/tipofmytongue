1
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,140
okay

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,220
Jean you need to

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,540
like a very simple machine usually it's

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,940
convenient to set it up with the milling

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,670
vise and drilling vise at the same time

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,369
because the drilling rise is quick

7
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,200
acting and of course saves a lot of time

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,360
but it's not stiff enough for milling it

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,250
to loosen so don't try to do milling in

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,960
it so you need a separate vise for

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,910
milling but there's plenty of room here

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,810
for both now this is a bit modified it

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,930
has this spring blow that stops so you

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,420
don't need space else it will stop by

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,300
itself but that's not important you can

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,150
always put some spacers inside now

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,220
there's a few other modifications here

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,360
which are worthwhile it's first of all

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,880
these meals come with a depth adjustment

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,240
which takes forever to temp so the first

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,420
thing you do is you drill a hole so the

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,119
knot at a slight angle so you can tell

23
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,640
the knot to position but if you want to

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,380
move it a lot you can just sealed it and

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,439
slide it and so you slide it and then

26
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,770
you just turn it okay so this saves a

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,969
lot of time now the one thing which is a

28
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,369
must on all these machines if they come

29
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,859
with a belt drive unit with replaced

30
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,799
with a step pulley it's a must not to

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,439
use that and put what's called the VFD

32
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,499
of a variable speed drive because that

33
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:42,479
is so much simpler and it's so cheap

34
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,639
that it's a waste of time to change the

35
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:47,689
speed any other way so for example

36
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,250
if I look at this

37
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,670
I can change the speed of a very very

38
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,310
wide range without having to touch the

39
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,150
pulleys so that's very very important

40
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,340
especially if you want to do tapping on

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,170
the same machine so you want to lower

42
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,060
the speed and so on a readout of course

43
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,970
which is really stand out today a very

44
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,430
very useful accessory for a machine like

45
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,770
this which unfortunately you can't buy

46
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,190
don't ask me why is some kind of a laser

47
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,370
center finder and all what it is is a

48
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,430
head from a laser pointer the lens is

49
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,620
moved a little bit to focus about here

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,350
and a battery and it's designed to clip

51
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,900
on the chalk or clip straight here on

52
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,140
the shank in case you use kaulitz

53
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,440
so this sits like this and what it does

54
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,680
it gives you a circle of light and the

55
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,320
nice thing about it

56
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,600
this the center of the circle is

57
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,900
actually the axis so if I want to line

58
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,540
up the machine with a feature I want to

59
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,030
drill on this mark say I have this mark

60
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,700
here and I want to line it up it's very

61
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,910
easy to line it up okay if I want to

62
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,550
build at the center of this I can make

63
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,380
this rod much bigger until it makes it

64
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,650
fun much bigger until I find the center

65
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,150
and then I find the center this way and

66
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,760
it's particularly useful if you want to

67
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,880
line up to drill to line up with the

68
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,870
hole or a pin so say for example if I if

69
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,940
I had a pin and I had to do it exactly

70
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,440
the middle

71
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,170
obviously I'll use the lathe but if this

72
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,060
was square let's say or some other shape

73
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,090
and I want to line up the spindle with

74
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,410
the middle of this boss what I would do

75
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,520
is we just go like this

76
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,270
see and it forms a ring around it and

77
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,460
that ringing position is very very

78
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,220
sensitive to alignment so if they go a

79
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,110
bit up here you can see if I'm just

80
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,290
misaligned the ring will move so you can

81
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,080
easily line up things to 50 micron in

82
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,730
one second and let's say you have

83
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,070
something with a hole in it and you can

84
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,670
see how it's very sensitive and you

85
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,010
adjust it until the ring of light is

86
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,550
horizontal then your Center to the hole

87
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,970
and the same thing if you want to cross

88
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,160
the if you want to drill exactly in the

89
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,080
middle you would

90
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,400
you would line it up like this until

91
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,910
them until the light just it's broken at

92
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,570
both ends at the same time

93
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,650
adjustable exist and then the light

94
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,960
stops when it hits the diameter so when

95
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,320
you get a via both sides it Center so

96
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,420
that's a very simple thing which as I

97
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,030
said it gives you about 50 micron with

98
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,380
no trouble but you have to make it

99
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,100
yourself

100
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,440
obviously it's made on the water jet so

101
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,090
it's very easy to make okay good so this

102
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,610
is all what you need here one other item

103
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,780
it is desirable to standardize on one

104
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,720
call it size for all your tooling so you

105
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,580
don't forget a change collet when you

106
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,100
change to link so this is standardized

107
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,890
on three-quarter inch collet so

108
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,620
everything which goes here like if you

109
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,840
look at the chalk or the bowling ball so

110
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,490
all the accessories are all at the same

111
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,820
shank okay so yes and even if you do

112
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,390
some drilling you try some milling you

113
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,510
try to pick some meals which also have

114
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,760
the same shank so you can switch

115
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,060
instantly for milling to drilling as you

116
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,100
know you cannot use milling cutters in a

117
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,530
chuck it's not rigid enough but this way

118
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,600
you can switch from milling to drilling

119
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,180
in and from boring and other things it

120
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,060
all sits in the same College size so you

121
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,000
have to add this wheel on top so you

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,300
don't need to look for wenches okay

123
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,500
again just one minute on the waterjet

124
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,240
it's up and you lock it and you're done

125
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,050
and obviously you want a chuck like this

126
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,750
not a key chuck because say the key chap

127
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,460
in we always have to look for the key

128
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,140
and so on and these checks are molecular

129
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,720
to it just do like this these Chuck's of

130
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,700
self tightening cream if you didn't

131
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,250
tighten them as it drills it will

132
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,020
tighten itself so you just do like this

133
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,680
it's locked

134
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,160
that's all and you drill and when you

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,570
finish training you do like this take

136
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,910
the drill out okay so it's a it's a lot

137
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,960
of time ok so this is a check and that

138
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,590
the only disadvantage of keyless chuck

139
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,180
that the same weight self-tightening

140
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,610
self-locking if you run it in reveals

141
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,400
itself opening so if you want to tap you

142
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,780
have to tighten it real hard

143
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,789
how can you reverse the tabs Chuck will

144
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:05,550
open ok so there's lots of material how

145
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,440
to use the lathe so we're not going to

146
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,720
get into it at all but just two things I

147
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,960
wanted to point out almost every lays

148
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,259
you look at has a three jaw Chuck what's

149
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,650
called a three Jo Universal where the

150
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,100
jaws move together it turns out that for

151
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,560
our MV wok and for actually most

152
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,720
position work it's a mistake it's much

153
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,910
better to put up on the laser for Jo

154
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,720
Chuck now the reason why people don't

155
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,449
think of a four jaw Chuck is they only

156
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,030
think of a three jaw Chuck is because a

157
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,880
lot of times in regular shops you have

158
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,460
to handle X agonal walk like to make

159
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,620
safe fittings it's all made for agonal

160
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,229
stock and most people don't realize that

161
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,840
you can grip a hex stock in a photo

162
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,260
Chuck without run out for example

163
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,650
because there are four points around the

164
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,520
hex which form a square so so if we put

165
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,270
it in like this say I can grip it

166
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,229
without run out okay now if you have a

167
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:16,110
photo Chuck you can grip square parts

168
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,659
which is very very useful and if you

169
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:21,599
grip round parts with a seen wall

170
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,030
because you're pushing at four points

171
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,710
instead of three points as much less

172
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,979
Distortion so I highly recommend that

173
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,139
you equipped all your legs with a photo

174
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,049
chakra so a very useful thing to have on

175
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,799
a lathe is to mount a video camera which

176
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,650
you can see the tool tip

177
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,620
for example if I had to do sledding on

178
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,010
some complicated part it's much easier

179
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,340
to see it on the video camera and I

180
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,520
approach the part and I can line it up

181
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,000
and basically this camera is about 100x

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,140
magnification so I can easily see a few

183
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,750
micron arrow here on the camera the

184
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,730
cheapest way to get these cameras and

185
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,400
monitors is to buy a kit which is called

186
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,180
a rear-view camera for cars which comes

187
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,830
with a display in the camera and you

188
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,030
just have to put in the different

189
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,610
housing and also change the distance of

190
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,380
the lens in order to get a different

191
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,900
magnification the whole thing is about a

192
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,820
hundred bucks and you can put it not

193
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,260
just on a lace but for many other

194
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,950
machine tools
