1
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,250
okay so what we are going to cover

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,050
now is flex chair

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,280
turgid and you

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,830
metal it's very very easy to make flex

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,090
gels so it'll describe a few types the

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,750
classic flex chair is simply a big block

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,310
cut out where you can put in not just a

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,880
one stage this is a linear stage which

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,809
I'll explain later but you can also put

10
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,960
reduction levers in order to get any

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,870
kind of range you want so if you

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,379
carefully follow what's going on here

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,820
the first stage is a five to one

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,679
reduction leave there where this is a

15
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,760
pivot this end is a pivot this piece is

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,210
called a wiggle bar it's used to

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,129
eliminate the effect of say the

18
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,019
eliminate the fact that this is actually

19
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,620
rotating around the pivot what you want

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,870
is you want a straight line motion so

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,840
you have to put in a bar that's effect

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,150
assort aids wouldn't be transferred to

23
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,640
the next stage okay specially decouple

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,710
the linear motion of the rotation

25
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,259
so these wiggle bars are like stand out

26
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:25,689
when you have multi stage flex chips so

27
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:29,140
you have so you have here a lever with a

28
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,170
micrometer school a wiggle bar and an

29
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,539
identical lever these two are identical

30
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:36,789
design the pivot is on this side and

31
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:39,219
just a wiggle bar again so this is a

32
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:41,649
five two one three two ones you get a 15

33
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,909
to one reduction coupled to a classical

34
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,240
design linear motion flexure stage so

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,579
all this is cut out of course one piece

36
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,740
on the waterjet if you want a very high

37
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,180
accuracy flex chair

38
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,630
you really should pre-drill the holes

39
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,429
because how well this moves and how

40
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:02,770
linear it is how much it follows a

41
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,799
straight line depends on the exact

42
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,699
matching of all the pivot points or the

43
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,000
elastic pivots now the water jet isn't

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,400
accurate enough to give you a

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,740
straightness of travel say in the range

46
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,020
of one micron so what you have to do you

47
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,330
have to drill and ream these holes and

48
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,310
then make all the other cuts with the

49
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:24,690
world

50
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,670
jet align the water jet to one of the

51
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,280
holes and add all the cuts now this way

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,220
you're going to get say a range here

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,770
which is maybe two millimeters travel

54
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,940
following a straight line to one micron

55
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,850
now for example if you look at the meter

56
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,160
here it's hooked up to a capacitance

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,170
gauge which measures the position of the

58
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,970
linear stage and the meter is set at the

59
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,550
highest gain here which is 10 nanometers

60
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,100
per division so you can see there is no

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,050
problem moving it 10 nano meter at a

62
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,450
time without any backlash I can go

63
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,160
forward and backward without any

64
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,490
backlash and easily set it to 10 nano

65
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,440
meter

66
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,480
now this flexure is just that you told

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,550
me also it's made of aluminum obviously

68
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,520
aluminum is very temperature sensitive

69
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,930
about 22,000 cppm per degree so even you

70
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,670
can't have aluminum if you want the

71
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,430
stability so in real life this will have

72
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,670
to be cut out of invar or maybe some

73
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,910
glass like waltz or some other material

74
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,120
which is very stable temperature you can

75
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,270
see because it's made of aluminum say if

76
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,390
I put it somewhere and I just put my

77
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,150
hand over it without touching it it just

78
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,850
drifts from the radiated heat for my

79
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,310
hand over the drifted like a hundred

80
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,100
nano meter just from the radiated heat I

81
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,800
take my hand away it's going to drift

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,190
slowly back to it's a slower one weighs

83
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,200
another so obviously this is not

84
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,330
designed for this kind of stability but

85
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,850
the principle the layout is classic

86
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,489
flexure you can make those at any size

87
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,209
of course now this is an example I

88
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,090
showed earlier this is a V that's about

89
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,720
as small as you can make on a water jet

90
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,988
because he'll the arms which flex are

91
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,570
about point three millimeter point four

92
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,030
millimeter wide and that's about as

93
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,840
narrow a parallel you can cut on the

94
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,630
water jet reliably

95
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,690
so this is made from a type 25 beryllium

96
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,640
copper which is very very flexible and

97
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,560
very nice to work with

98
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,990
and it's a bit similar to that although

99
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,200
you can't quite see it here in details

100
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,600
as I mentioned before to you the nuts

101
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,669
are actually inserted in little water

102
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,190
jet cut slots so you don't have to do

103
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,130
any machining or tapping except going

104
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,169
over the middle hole with a reamer of a

105
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,630
drill

106
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,350
now these flex shares are limited by the

107
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,590
elastic range of the material so if you

108
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,750
even if you take very good steel the

109
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,340
elastic range is 1% so you can't have

110
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,860
large travel but what you can do you can

111
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,590
make flex chairs where the flexing parts

112
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,910
are nitinol and 19 all has an elastic

113
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,040
range about 10 times steel

114
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,410
now it's an expensive material it's too

115
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,090
expensive to cut out the whole block

116
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,090
from 19 all but what you can easily do

117
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,300
is you can do the same design from sheet

118
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,740
metal in 19 all so this linear motion is

119
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,200
the same as this so I'll show how it

120
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,550
works so if I hold down the base and I

121
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,460
move this this is a moving part now

122
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,220
you'll notice that the moving part moves

123
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,270
X the side bars move half x so you can't

124
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,919
clamp it by the side bars because they

125
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,430
have to move so let's show it again so

126
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,280
if I hold it here this is a base this is

127
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,090
a moving part okay and you can see the

128
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,100
side valves also moving half the amount

129
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,979
now this moves in a perfectly straight

130
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,830
line and the easiest way to explain why

131
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,530
it's because it's symmetric so because

132
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,690
of symmetry why would you go one way not

133
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,570
the other now it has high high stiffness

134
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,590
in this plane because these white strips

135
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,450
would have some outer buckle

136
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,380
okay it has high stiffness in this plane

137
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,610
because these tapes would have to

138
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,360
tension to stretch it has high stiffness

139
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,570
in any kind of rotational motion in the

140
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,750
only direction it is soft is this way

141
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,120
okay and because it's not you know you

142
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,700
can have this is a 20 millimeter range

143
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,130
flexure which is quite nice

144
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,160
now a couple of tricks that I mentioned

145
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,490
before 19 all cannot be spot-welded so

146
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,920
you trap each piece between two little

147
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,040
pieces of stainless you bend the edges

148
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,350
around in order not to have a sharp

149
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,660
transition that's very important of

150
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,040
course because anything is a sharp

151
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,510
transition with a stress concentration

152
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:14,010
problem and you very very carefully

153
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,250
measure to make those equal so in other

154
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,930
words the best way to do that is

155
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,030
actually have some jig which is a piece

156
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,250
of metal acting as a spacer so when you

157
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,520
weld you insert this piece of metal and

158
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,260
then you weld and then you take it out

159
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,130
so the spacing is the same everywhere

160
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,260
because they how stray how much of a

161
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,810
straight line it will travel has to do

162
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,700
with exactly matching those eight

163
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,990
Springs both in length and stiffness so

164
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,060
stiffness is no problems at all go on

165
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,400
strip but in length have to be quite

166
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,280
nicely matched now you can cheat a bit

167
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,290
if you made one of those and measured it

168
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,420
and you found out that it's not a

169
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,880
perfectly straight line you can actually

170
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,150
modify the springs after the fact for

171
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,040
example you can either grind them a bit

172
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,470
or you can clamp something on them to

173
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,210
change the stiffness of the pivot point

174
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,340
so a lot of these flex chips are

175
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,350
collected after they're assembled if you

176
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,880
really need the ultimate straightness

177
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,790
the easiest way to test the straightness

178
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,620
all that you have to do is put it here

179
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,770
put a laser pointer here like clamp it

180
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,480
to the table put the laser pointer here

181
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,940
shoot a beam across the room say 10

182
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,330
metres away and have somebody move this

183
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,040
while you're standing there watching the

184
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,680
spot of the laser pointer on the wall

185
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,409
because one milli Radian arrow in 10

186
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,070
metres will be a 10 millimeter which is

187
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,530
quite visible so you can measure it down

188
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,690
to 50 micro Radian just by watching the

189
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,390
laser spot now if you want to measure it

190
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,700
more precisely you need an auto column a

191
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,920
toe so basically autocollimator is

192
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,960
something which looks at a reflection of

193
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,450
a target you put a mirror here is that

194
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,580
have another column a toe and with that

195
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,070
one you can measure Sabich seconds okay

196
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,980
because if there is a deviation for

197
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,149
linearity it must be accompanied by an

198
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:09,670
angular motion because one is just

199
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,160
integral of Zaza so so it's much easier

200
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,209
to measure the angular motion because of

201
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:18,490
reflection of light so basically you

202
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,680
measure the angular motion and then you

203
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,600
can integrate it and get this deviation

204
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,230
for straightness okay so this is this

205
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,139
type of flexure now this is a very

206
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:33,070
common type called a flex pivot and this

207
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,250
is used whenever you need pivots which

208
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,829
don't have to rotate a full circle let's

209
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,839
say you have some arm which has to go to

210
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,139
two positions so instead of putting

211
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:46,209
bearings you can do it what's called the

212
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:49,329
cross hinge flex chair you can see one

213
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,220
strip goes this way and of course this

214
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,360
way so all the small angles it behaves

215
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,459
as if there was a real people here in

216
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,019
other words the centre of rotation is

217
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:02,470
fixed to illustrate there I connect the

218
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,440
two pointers here one point on each arm

219
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,319
and you can see where the two pointers

220
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:11,500
point to each other so when I tilt it at

221
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,319
small angles the tips of the pointers

222
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,269
don't move relative to each other at a

223
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:19,750
big angle the pointers will separate but

224
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,639
for small angles the tips of the pointer

225
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,440
behave if as if there's a pivot point

226
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,910
there okay and this also is made of 19

227
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,819
also it can bend 90 degrees okay so

228
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,560
that's a classic cause hinge

229
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,639
now the general advantage of flex checks

230
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,410
over traditional methods like slides is

231
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,540
a no lubrication so it's good in dirty

232
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,610
environment and you never worry about

233
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,850
having to get there to lubricate it

234
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,819
number 2 no we're okay obviously it's

235
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,740
just flexure there's nowhere if you

236
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,889
design it right there is infinite life

237
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:07,329
ok and now number 3 no backlash because

238
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:10,060
because any stage like this you have to

239
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,949
add some preload with the spring you

240
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:13,420
have to be always careful of a backlash

241
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,610
and also sideways you have to adjust the

242
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,810
preload schools

243
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,390
carefully says he effectively adjusted

244
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,520
because once it wears a beard is going

245
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,370
to be a bit of looseness now in this

246
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,560
thing that is never going to develop any

247
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,110
play or looseness okay so these are

248
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,080
three huge advantages okay now the

249
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,330
biggest advantage the first one that

250
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,700
it's basically free because if you have

251
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,380
a water jet all that you need is a piece

252
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,810
of scrap metal now this these things

253
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,110
cost at least 100 hundred bucks right

254
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,820
and this is free basically takes five

255
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,310
minutes so and you can incorporate it

256
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,620
into your design like integral flex gels

257
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,010
so especially for our ad for students

258
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,450
you can make as many of those as you

259
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,930
want okay

260
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,070
so that's yeah one one comment about

261
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,600
what limits elastic range because in

262
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,880
order to have infinite life you cannot

263
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,370
use up all the elastic range elastic

264
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,160
range means the formation after which it

265
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,640
doesn't return anymore today if you go

266
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,080
beyond the elastic range it will stay

267
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,260
permanently deformed so if you want

268
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,330
infinite life on flex chairs you

269
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,190
shouldn't use up more than about two

270
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,100
sales of the elastic range now the exact

271
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,930
number depends on the metal in some

272
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,420
metals you can use up 70% some metal you

273
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,730
cannot exceed 30% in order infant life

274
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,940
but just it's a quick and dirty rule

275
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,610
if you bend something in a Flex chair

276
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,830
and you find out the elastic range you

277
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,200
know never never go more than two-thirds

278
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,270
of it preferably stay below half of it

279
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,260
and then it will last forever
