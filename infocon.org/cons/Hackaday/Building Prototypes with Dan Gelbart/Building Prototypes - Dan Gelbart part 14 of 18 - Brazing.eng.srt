1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,150
okay so what we'll cover

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,860
now is how to make

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,250
take a

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,820
like castings because unfortunately

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,380
everything in the world can be made on

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,539
the water jet and if you start dealing

7
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:21,670
with three-dimensional structures which

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,050
have to be very rigid heavy machine able

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,050
you have to make them from solid and the

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,360
two choices always to mill it out on a

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,840
solid block which is expensive both in

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,199
terms of material and machine time or a

13
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:42,400
mill it out from a machine and near net

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,120
shape near net shape could be a casting

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,300
for jingo something bent and then

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,340
machined so obviously there's a huge

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,980
advantage of a near net shape and most

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,680
of the big machinery in the world is

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,489
made from castings for that reason in a

20
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,109
having the environment castings have a

21
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,360
tedious process because you have to make

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,039
patterns it's not the kind of thing you

23
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:08,619
can easily do at home so there is an

24
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:10,810
alternate process which is to build it

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,660
up from segments by brazing now the

26
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,340
other process which is used a lot in

27
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,130
industry is weldment is just to build it

28
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,500
up by welding but to build up by welding

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,080
needs a lot more skills and to build up

30
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,659
by brazing when there are because our

31
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:28,479
two disadvantages to welding first there

32
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,280
is heavy distortion no matter how

33
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,110
carefully you weld because of the

34
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,540
shrinkage of the weld bead is always

35
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,500
Distortion

36
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,650
but the other disadvantage of welding

37
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,619
besides needing skills is that you

38
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:43,630
cannot well together

39
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,140
very dissimilar metals like in sometimes

40
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,720
in same problem in the casting sometimes

41
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,820
you would like to have one side of the

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,040
machine made of steel but the other side

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,439
made of brass because you want to do

44
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,630
some bearings or machining there now you

45
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,460
can't have a casting which one and this

46
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,219
t1 and this brass it's also it can have

47
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,840
a weldment like that because you can

48
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,790
have two types of steel welder to get

49
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,789
there but not Stephan brass but when you

50
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,980
build it up by brazing you can make each

51
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,360
segment from a different material

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,579
according to the best material you need

53
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:18,130
so just to illustrate it we'll just make

54
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,610
up some imaginary part that we want this

55
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,769
to be steel but we want the boss made of

56
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,510
brass here and later on it'll get

57
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,540
machined and the

58
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,640
litical points because it's a near net

59
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,250
shape so all the parts are cut out of

60
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,819
water jet and usually you have to cut

61
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,370
out some tape to register it here I

62
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,319
didn't buzz out with it so recall before

63
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,359
we usually cut out a little finger a

64
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,430
little square hole so everything is

65
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,290
register when you put it together within

66
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,560
bother you another way you can do is you

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,760
can take things in place okay and I

68
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,099
usually do it with a laser well there

69
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,099
which is a little bit exotic but you can

70
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,560
just put a dollar pin or anything so

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,599
let's just take it in place with the

72
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,819
laser well there and then we'll prepare

73
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,430
it for brazing but you laser welder in

74
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,049
the luxury here you don't have to do it

75
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:11,299
you can also spot well detectors but

76
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:13,819
well there but not the brass and so on

77
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,489
okay so let's just take things in place

78
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:17,750
where we want them and then we'll

79
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,959
prepare okay so these laser

80
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,879
well--there's which are about twenty

81
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,950
thousand bucks are surprisingly

82
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,609
versatile machines and if you budget

83
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,319
allows it I highly recommend them

84
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,530
because they advantage of them over any

85
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,650
other web there that is they can weld in

86
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,139
two very hard to reach places as long as

87
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,510
you can see the place with a microscope

88
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,159
it will well they're just the lightest

89
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,109
to get there and they can when

90
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:47,659
dissimilar metals together because the

91
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:50,030
pulse is so fast that nothing has a

92
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,310
chance to to cause trouble and Auto

93
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,590
oxidize so they actually weld without an

94
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,810
inert atmosphere because the weight is

95
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,760
so fast that even regular steel doesn't

96
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,479
oxidize so so let's just check things in

97
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,069
place okay

98
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,060
so that's where did a bit coolkid these

99
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,800
are temporary where's I can break them

100
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:23,060
if I want to that's good enough okay and

101
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,550
I want a brass boss at this place

102
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:34,099
so that's a beauty of the laser well

103
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,389
there that it doesn't care what the

104
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:37,550
metal is I can weld aluminum to steel

105
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,039
silver to to lead and I can write

106
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,889
anything to anything so the brazing is

107
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,949
done by placing little pieces of brazing

108
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,580
wire which is a typically a silver

109
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,099
copper alloy some other materials and

110
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:55,610
flux and the flux is what it makes it

111
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,949
wet the metal because the flux dissolves

112
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,749
the oxide and the flux protects the

113
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,699
metal from oxidization so without flux

114
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,129
it wouldn't work now typically there is

115
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:08,059
a white flux which is basically borax

116
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:10,580
which is the most common flux for all

117
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,309
non-ferrous and can be used on ion as

118
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:16,219
well and there is a black flux which

119
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,599
actually I'm not sure what the

120
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,339
composition saying it's some fluoride

121
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:22,009
salt which is used for stainless and

122
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:24,289
harder to blaze materials because it's

123
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:26,029
more aggressive okay

124
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,999
the only expensive party is a why of the

125
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:31,550
fluxes are they're cheap so the way you

126
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,029
deal with this is okay let's say we can

127
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,949
use the white flux on the brass although

128
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:37,909
it's not going to make much difference

129
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:40,279
which flux so if you want to do a very

130
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,279
nice job it's nice to put a wire all

131
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,839
around it it can be done although the

132
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,569
material will flow but to be really sure

133
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:52,519
you can put it where you can put it all

134
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,789
around it and what I can do here the

135
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,089
flux is like a paste you can just fill

136
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:02,179
the corners wipe off the excess and put

137
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:06,110
me place a piece of wire on it and wash

138
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,050
my hands well because I don't know how

139
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:15,229
close is it is so so you just put in a

140
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:20,149
bit of flux everywhere too much flux is

141
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,309
not a big problem is you just cleans up

142
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:25,179
easily later

143
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:27,649
so you're basically creating a little

144
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:30,259
fill it with the flux where you want the

145
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:34,309
brace fill it to be and we'll try the

146
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:37,279
white flux on the bond the last piece

147
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,199
although it's going to work without the

148
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,180
flux as well and

149
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,660
just white wipe away the excess flux and

150
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,760
the reason I'm doing it that the flux

151
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,070
somewhat attacks the metal

152
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,590
so just for cosmetic reasons I don't

153
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,060
want surface defects on the metal

154
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,740
because at the high temperature the flux

155
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,160
will actually interact with the Matalin

156
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,330
slightly attack it just lay little

157
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,830
pieces at the corners in theory if there

158
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,660
is good wetting one piece will run

159
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,600
everywhere but since I don't know how

160
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,910
well the parts fit and I also would like

161
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,410
to have a feel it so I'm actually

162
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,290
putting plenty of material to create a

163
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:29,180
nice feel it yes now obviously when the

164
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,550
material starts melting if it was a

165
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,700
vertical wall the why it wouldn't really

166
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,270
wet it just fall off so if you have you

167
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,920
try to lay out everything that a

168
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,320
horizontal plane but if you have no

169
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,570
choice if you have to weld something

170
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,530
like this and something like this Oh

171
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,200
braze and you wanted a joint heel so

172
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,000
it's a few tricks you can do you can put

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,280
a lot more stuff on top hope you'll be

174
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,740
pull down or another thing you can do

175
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,190
you can drill a hole here and put inside

176
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,970
the few slugs of a welding brazing wire

177
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,850
with flux so as it melts it will come

178
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,980
out and fill the gap the last choice is

179
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,600
to braise it in two steps

180
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,060
it refers to all the horizontal walls

181
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,590
and put it on the side to the other

182
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,690
direction but to do that these have to

183
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,060
be secured with Wells or pins so when

184
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,030
you turn it around they don't fall off

185
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,919
and the blades melt so since this is

186
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,440
laser welded if I had a vertical brace I

187
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,360
could have put it on the side and then a

188
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,969
second place it's problematic because

189
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:36,830
when you do the first rays it gets

190
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,620
oxidized okay so you have to fill it

191
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,839
with flux even if it wouldn't brace on

192
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,460
the first place the gaps have to lose

193
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,040
flux so they don't oxidize so it is

194
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,800
better if you had to do braces onto

195
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,750
planes it's better actually to figure

196
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,160
out a way to

197
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,410
2001 breeze now the gaps can be anywhere

198
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,100
from zero to maybe half a millimeter

199
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,600
because if the gaps are too big the

200
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,959
capillary action will be too weak so you

201
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,000
can buy different wires with different

202
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,009
abilities to fill gaps but in general if

203
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,120
the gap is more than half a millimeter

204
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,680
it's not a good idea it should be

205
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,129
machine tighter you can also get those

206
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:18,439
in for you so sometimes gives two big

207
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:20,600
areas you can put a foil underneath

208
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,790
covered with flux okay and for good

209
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,759
measure I will just add a bit more flux

210
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,529
basically the wire has to be half-buried

211
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:48,239
in the flux okay the next step we put it

212
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:51,059
in the oven typically we set the

213
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:55,730
temperature for about 750 see

214
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,230
temperatures to be about a hundred

215
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,600
degrees above the melting point of the

216
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,699
braze alloy because you want a you want

217
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:04,319
to be sure that males and bead has to be

218
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:05,759
very liquid you want it to flow

219
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,519
beautifully but if it's too high just

220
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,489
cause needless oxidation so you look up

221
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:13,589
the melting point of air law and add

222
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:15,299
anywhere from fifty to a hundred degrees

223
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,689
so this is believed melts at about 680 C

224
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:33,449
so I'm setting it for 750 C okay and

225
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:35,999
then you just come back in an hour and

226
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:40,379
it's all done now if the piece is big is

227
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:43,230
a recipe for braising the same recipe is

228
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,569
for making a turkey so it has to reach

229
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:47,610
temperature and then you give it about

230
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,779
one hour for every kilo extra because it

231
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,569
takes time for the body to absorb heat

232
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:57,389
and equalize so this since this was

233
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:00,449
maybe half a kilo I just have to get to

234
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:02,399
temperature and then maybe another half

235
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,569
an hour okay so now this set once it

236
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:08,790
reached temperature its set for at least

237
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,279
half an hour more which is enough to

238
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,350
equalize the temperature so we turn off

239
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,999
the oven and we don't touch anything

240
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:21,569
until it cools down to about five

241
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:24,660
hundred degrees and we can touch it okay

242
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,089
so this is the part we took out from the

243
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:29,850
oven before after it cooled down and we

244
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,029
send blasted it and you can see a few

245
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,220
things first you can see that you have a

246
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,709
casting which each part is a different

247
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,389
metal which is very useful only for

248
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:41,100
example you could have stainless steel

249
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,410
inserts and anything you want hardening

250
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,049
cells all in the same casting second

251
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:48,929
thing you can see is a nice wedding so

252
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:51,299
that it made a nice feel it and if you

253
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:53,009
wanted to paint it and you wanted to

254
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:53,660
really look

255
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,730
perfect all that you have to do is just

256
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,730
send the feel it's a little bit to round

257
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,940
them up so all you'll have to do is take

258
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,880
something like this bend it over there

259
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,780
and just go let's go legs is a bit more

260
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,620
than that until the feel it is smooth

261
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,770
okay

262
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,510
and this way once you paint it it looks

263
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,460
like a perfect casting it looks much

264
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,290
nicer than a casting because the casting

265
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,290
wouldn't have such nice smooth surfaces

266
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,300
now it is as strong as the casting it's

267
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,790
actually a bit stronger because casting

268
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,160
is made from cast iron and cast iron is

269
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,680
much weaker than steel so it's a

270
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,110
comparison for example this is a piece

271
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,530
of cast iron and if I put it in the vise

272
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,620
I should have no problem breaking it and

273
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,450
certainly if I hit it with a hammer it

274
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,160
will share tale because cast iron is so

275
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,020
basically as you can see cast and this

276
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,510
is very high quality cast iron the

277
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,280
reason I know that it's out of a very

278
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,020
old machine and the older of the better

279
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,570
of the cast iron was but basically cast

280
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,700
iron is not such a strong material as

281
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,690
you can see if you break it by hand just

282
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,190
hit it with a hammer it's broken

283
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,290
that's why cast machinery is so heavy

284
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,970
because the material is actually not

285
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,130
strong on the other hand if I take the

286
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,220
casting built up by brazing and I do the

287
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,850
same test so here I should be able to

288
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,330
bend the metal without actually breaking

289
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,240
the joint so let's put on a big wrench

290
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:40,930
on it and go from here this

291
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,270
so you can see that it's much stronger

292
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,870
than crafting both for regular stress

293
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,959
and also for hammering so all together

294
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,149
it looks nicer and it's much stronger

295
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,380
and more versatile
