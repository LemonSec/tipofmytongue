1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,010
okay so we'll very quickly go through

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,910
the basics of machining and now there

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,710
are lots of videos and books and courses

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,960
on how to machine so we'll only cover

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,080
just some minut aspects of it we don't

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,500
need to do it all here but a few basic

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,250
things first how to drill a hole so when

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,099
you want to drill a hole usually you

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,349
have to Center punch it to guide the

10
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,500
drill but in order to place a center

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,140
punch accurately usually do it by

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,540
scribing lines by laying it out and

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,360
skiving lines and you can do it with any

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,479
shell at all like a scribe err what is

15
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,120
important to know that you don't locate

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,489
the center punch by looking at the lines

17
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,129
you locate it by feel because that's

18
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:54,869
much more accurate than looking so say

19
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:57,659
if I want to place a hole here eight

20
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,049
millimeter say from the edge and I want

21
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,089
to locate it so many millimeters of this

22
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:08,720
edge okay oh I can lay down your layer

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,540
and I can use a skybell okay hey I'm not

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,870
I'm not going to place it by looking at

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,370
the line I'm just going to slide it

26
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,580
until I feel the line and and when I

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,770
come to the crossing of the lines I feel

28
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,320
it locks in place I actually feel it it

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,180
moves a piece with it because it locked

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,960
in place and at that place I would press

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,110
to make a light Center mark and then I

32
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,320
would reinforce it with a big Center

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,230
mark which also means that these punches

34
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,450
always have to be very sharp you sharpen

35
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,890
them at about ninety degree

36
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,270
tip angle but they have to be quite

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,500
sharp so you can feel the line okay so

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,970
again you have to feel the previous hole

39
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,630
and again you feel it gripped okay now

40
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,180
sometimes if you don't see the lines

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,659
well for orientation what you can do is

42
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,119
you can take your razor ball markets and

43
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,269
just go over the area are you this is

44
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:13,950
very convenient because if you go over

45
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,660
the area you're walking on was in

46
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,340
available mark here you will see the

47
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:17,730
lines

48
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,220
well and then you just wipe it off so I

49
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,260
do the same thing again so now you can

50
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,489
see the lines much better same thing you

51
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,290
would feel until it grips the

52
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:44,459
intersection of the lines and then you

53
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,879
can just wipe off everything instantly

54
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,340
okay so now if you want to drill a very

55
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,319
precise hole you would start with a

56
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,950
smaller diameter hole okay it also makes

57
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,510
it easier to drill if you have to drill

58
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,879
big sizes you start off with a smaller

59
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,019
diameter hole and then enlarge it so in

60
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,049
this case you can do it by I say or you

61
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:10,609
can do it with the laser fine there

62
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,540
okay

63
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:25,540
okay so now so

64
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:36,390
a small hole follow it up as a full-size

65
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,610
hole now the reason why you need to

66
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,120
drill a small hole first is the drill

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,870
has a certain web width and in a bigger

68
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,870
drill the web itself is wider than the

69
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,210
Central Park so the center mark cannot

70
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,100
guide the drill because the web will

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,620
straddle it so you have to do it with a

72
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,110
small size so it will Center itself on

73
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,900
the mark and then you do it with the

74
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,380
full size

75
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:17,200
Hey and while it's all set up that's the

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,810
right time to be bear it with a

77
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:27,880
countersink oh you can develop the other

78
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,460
side or if sometimes you can also do

79
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,910
bear it with a tool like this which is

80
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:43,510
made for the bearing holes okay if it

81
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,910
leaves as big a bear as it left here it

82
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,620
means the tool was the drill wasn't

83
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,180
shout because it really shouldn't leave

84
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,900
such a big bear

85
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,440
okay and go there if you can get to the

86
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,090
other side and if it's a big bear you

87
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,470
should use a countersink of course

88
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,020
sometimes you have to Devere something

89
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,910
from the inside like if you drill a hole

90
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,190
inside the pipe of a box and you have to

91
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,919
repair the inside where you can't reach

92
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,500
in with a needle bearing tool so the way

93
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,900
you would do it you would use a tool

94
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,289
which looks like a wood chisel except

95
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:23,440
sharpened at a pretty dull angle maybe

96
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,380
80 degrees or 90 degrees and this is a

97
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,830
bit rounded which is also convenient now

98
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,780
and the way you would do bear it you

99
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,720
would just come inside like this and hit

100
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,750
it with a hammer yes they would go like

101
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,090
this or almost parallel to the surface

102
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:49,810
just at a slight slight angle what it

103
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,050
does it shears off all the bells in the

104
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,530
inside so though basically three ways to

105
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,770
make a hole with a drill press or a

106
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,010
milling machine one is drilling that I

107
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,330
showed you before

108
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,190
one is reaming which is more accurate

109
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,590
the drilling is the next step and

110
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,530
another one is boring okay which is

111
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,690
comparable accuracy to reaming but it's

112
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,000
variable size and it's especially

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,830
suitable for large holes where it's how

114
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,830
to get such a large email so let's just

115
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,990
see the steps so when you start drilling

116
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,729
if you didn't send them punch and so on

117
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:30,139
it's a good idea that you start with a

118
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,020
central drill the center drill is very

119
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,410
rigid so it wouldn't put off start with

120
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:45,650
the center drill and if you want to ream

121
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,130
you use an undersized drill typically

122
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,539
point one point two millimeter

123
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,560
undersized okay it's always a good idea

124
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,530
when you drill and you have electronic

125
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,919
readout to zero it so just in case you

126
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:02,930
bump the handles if you didn't lock them

127
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,259
you can always come back to zero so now

128
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,190
we drill the hole

129
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,890
now if okay if this whole has to save as

130
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,040
a bearing like us for a shaft or so on

131
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,200
drilling doesn't leave an accurate

132
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,320
enough diameter or surface and you have

133
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,270
to remit so as I said I drilled it

134
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,900
undersized by about 4 and 0.2 millimeter

135
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,990
I can remit to get a better finish for

136
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,150
aiming I should put some cutting oil or

137
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,090
wax on the remail just a little bit of

138
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,310
work especially for aluminum which can

139
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,080
stick to the tool and you do it at low

140
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,430
speed don't worry about the run-out

141
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,670
because the reamer is flexible it will

142
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:12,370
find its own place in the hole ok and

143
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,460
now I should get a nice reamed hole

144
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,070
which would be a nice fit as for example

145
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:25,990
to a 10 millimeter dowel pin so it's a

146
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,090
nice tight fit for that material dowel

147
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,460
pin there was something important I

148
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,979
should mention right here when you try

149
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,039
to put in a very precise shaft in a very

150
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,979
precise hole it always looks it always

151
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,410
binds and this is fundamental it's not

152
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,850
because you did something wrong

153
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,430
because of those fundamental geometry

154
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,260
you can reach a locking condition and

155
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,680
the way to avoid it is your machine a

156
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,920
recess in the shaft you basically leave

157
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,220
one millimeter of the full diameter

158
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,570
followed by a groove which is a few

159
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,450
millimeter wide and then we leave the

160
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,730
full diameter again and the reason for

161
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,340
that is if you have a very narrow link

162
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,940
of the right diameter you can still tilt

163
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,070
it because you can tilt a narrow ring in

164
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,640
a precise hole so it doesn't look and by

165
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,440
the time it comes down to the second

166
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,980
correct diameter itself aligns so that's

167
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,760
a

168
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,170
very very important trick because

169
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,000
otherwise is especially if you got a

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,730
large shaft and a large bearing if it

171
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,800
was exactly accurate you would spend an

172
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,510
hour trying to put it in it'll all this

173
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,420
Jam so if you machine this groove it be

174
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,910
self aligning okay so this is a reamed

175
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,990
hole and now if I want to have a special

176
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,970
sized hole which I don't have a remake

177
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,580
for or if I want to have a blind hole

178
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,770
because we males don't walk in blind

179
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,310
holes because lemurs are tapered

180
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,320
slightly so I have to go through to get

181
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
the accuracy so if I wanted to have a

182
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,970
step of a blind hole or a big hole I

183
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,850
have to use a boring head okay unlike

184
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,310
drilling or reaming when you're doing

185
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,050
when you're boring because the rigidity

186
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,240
of the machine is very important because

187
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,280
it's a single point cutting action

188
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,130
there's no balancing force like a drill

189
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,860
has two leaps so the forces cancel out

190
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,010
because the diameter but here is only

191
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,560
one point so it will tend to deflect so

192
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,210
that's why I had to raise the table a

193
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,400
lot in order to minimize the coil

194
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,770
overhang so when you're bobbing

195
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,900
everything has to be adjusted to be

196
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,030
rigid so the machine has to be locked

197
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,260
the wheel overhead has to be minimized

198
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,720
everything has to be tight and rigid and

199
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,370
now you have to adjust the diameter down

200
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,910
here okay

201
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,470
so let's say we'll open up this hole

202
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,570
from ten millimeter to about twelve

203
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,350
millimeter and go a bit faster because

204
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,040
it's aluminum

205
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,160
and what's nice about it but I can

206
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,019
machine to a step I don't have to go

207
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:24,769
soon and then you can go back and forth

208
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:28,550
once or twice just to take any kind of

209
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:35,769
flagship out of the tool okay that's it

210
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:40,040
and this makes a quite a nice hole

211
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,279
suitable for a shaft sometimes you have

212
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,100
no choice and you have to mill a housing

213
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,009
or a part completely from solid like

214
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,499
this housing was milled from solid

215
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:54,259
because it had to be completely light

216
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:56,749
tight so it had to have a labyrinth seal

217
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,149
for the light and also had to have

218
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:02,329
precision machine references inside so

219
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:05,540
it was already to the point it was just

220
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,689
as fast to mill it on a CNC mill from

221
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:11,480
solid now a few things are very

222
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,100
important when you start milling crowds

223
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,059
on a meal is that first of all there are

224
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:21,559
two types of milling cutters ball nose

225
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:25,339
cutter which have a round nose the ball

226
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:28,069
nose cartels and regular cartels there's

227
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:30,230
also two flute and four flute but that's

228
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,329
less important now the important thing

229
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:34,120
to know that the ball nose cutter

230
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,649
removes metal much faster than this

231
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:39,350
cutter and also doesn't have a sharp

232
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,620
edge which is born to breakage so if you

233
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,660
can be if you don't need sharp corners

234
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,540
inside always specify round corners

235
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,339
always leave around corners because then

236
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,220
you can do it with a ball nose cutter

237
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,480
now the second thing you should always

238
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,899
keep in mind that how fast you can meal

239
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,540
and how accurate you can meal has to do

240
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,089
with the stiffness of the meal how much

241
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,860
it can deflect if you can deflect too

242
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,360
much it you can check their you cannot

243
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,379
take a big feed now how much a mill

244
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:12,620
deflects if you grip it here the formula

245
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,370
for the stiffness is d to the power of 4

246
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,029
divided by L to the power of 3 so it's D

247
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,160
to the force divided by L to the three

248
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,110
so if you take

249
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,060
say mean like this and you make it a

250
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,480
twice in diameter and half the legs the

251
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,970
stiffness would be 128 times higher so

252
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,700
it's closed as a seventh power basically

253
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,370
so basically you when you sink of it

254
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,290
always seeing how to design it that you

255
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,850
can use the biggest diameter than the

256
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,430
shortest meal so using the biggest

257
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,530
diameter means if you don't need a tight

258
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,670
corner here

259
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,880
just leave the biggest radius you can so

260
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,980
all this is designed here for icing a

261
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,740
half inch mirage's the second thing is

262
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,990
if you have a housing for milling always

263
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,910
split it in the middle if you can

264
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,030
that's roughly split in the middle don't

265
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,550
split it at the deep housing and ass in

266
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,190
top because the deep housing will need a

267
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,010
long meal and if it's twice as deep it

268
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,110
will be eight times less stiff and a

269
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,840
little bit much slower so try to always

270
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,540
design it around these tools when you

271
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,760
design for milling otherwise it's really

272
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,970
no special tricks in the milling and

273
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,450
with a CNC machines available you can

274
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,840
make very complex and beautiful walk but

275
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,330
it takes some programming skills and

276
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,610
also there's a clamping issue when you

277
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,800
merely always have to think if you want

278
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,530
to mill the inside and the outside you

279
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,330
always want to think what is the minimum

280
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,970
number of clamping ZAR need because in

281
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,850
theory if you have a piece like that you

282
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,550
need to clamp it many times to get all

283
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,790
the sides okay but we're by doing things

284
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,270
cleverly you can for example if you

285
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,610
clamp it one way you can not only get

286
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,500
the inside and the top you can get these

287
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,580
two sides okay and then if you clamp it

288
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,590
the other way like this you can get

289
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,660
these two sides on the top so although

290
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,520
you are talking about six surfaces you

291
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,010
can do it in two clamping and if you're

292
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,840
really smart you always think how can I

293
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,570
do it in one clamping for example if

294
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,280
there is a place here that you don't

295
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,620
mind to have two holes because I say

296
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,950
have a deco going over it anyway so you

297
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,920
can put a couple of clamping holes or

298
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,410
tooling holes you can put down schools

299
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,950
into T nuts into the T slots okay and

300
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,960
then you can go

301
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,630
all sides five sides out of six in one

302
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,150
clamping so always think of tooling

303
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,640
holes okay so you start off with a blank

304
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,950
you if you don't mind having a couple of

305
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,920
tooling holes and it helps a lot because

306
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,080
the clamping is not just an inch it's a

307
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,020
double issue it's an issue of accuracy

308
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,940
because when you reclaim you lost all

309
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,590
accuracy because everything is

310
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,990
registered to each other in one clamping

311
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,490
but now when you change the clamping

312
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,220
these features are no longer register so

313
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,960
it's very hard to maintain accuracy with

314
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,870
multiple clamping and you have to come

315
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,060
back to the machine because the CNC

316
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,710
machine can sits up for hours do

317
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,840
everything but it cannot be clamped for

318
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,090
you so if to go back to the machine so

319
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,160
this issue of minimizing number of

320
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,590
clamping minimize maximizing middle

321
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,620
stiffness that's a key to a good CNC

322
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,070
programming
