1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,470
so this session is a quick set

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,950
about safety like the first thing you

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,930
have to know

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,220
of course to follow

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,410
the rules of the workshop you are

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,620
working in some workshop have rules you

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,360
have to have goggles all the time some

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,090
workshops have always you have to have a

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,700
steel toed shoes all the time so

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,980
whatever the holes are of your place you

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,259
walk obviously you follow them but the

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,380
purpose of this short video is actually

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,350
to point out two unexpected safety

14
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,800
hazards because I'm assuming you know

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,600
the basic safety hazards of all the

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,890
machines but there's quite a lot of

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,880
unexpected safety hazards so

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,250
surprisingly the most dangerous machine

19
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,710
in a machine shop is always a

20
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,110
woodworking machine now the reason for

21
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,750
that is that woodworking machinery runs

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,760
at very high speed and the tools are

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,570
very sharp

24
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,449
typically woodworking tools on ten times

25
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:07,030
the speed of metalworking tools the

26
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,490
surface speed and they're all the tools

27
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,950
are very very sharp so the chances of

28
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,860
cutting off your finger in a woodworking

29
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,140
machine is much much higher than in any

30
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,480
metalworking machine because it only

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,940
takes a fraction of a second if this

32
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,380
would simulate your finger

33
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:34,009
and and even and even if you're seeing

34
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,579
the blade even if you think the blade is

35
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:38,869
almost stopped

36
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:40,850
if you carelessly bring your hand to the

37
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,310
blade just before stopping it can still

38
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,929
cut off your finger if with that speed

39
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:48,679
you can seize it when I tell them that

40
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:52,520
it almost stopped it is still cut off

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,009
your finger I twice just with the last

42
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,829
few terms if the blade makes okay so

43
00:01:57,829 --> 00:01:59,689
it's a very very dangerous machine even

44
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:01,039
when it's nearly stopped

45
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:03,380
so obviously you stay away from the

46
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,890
blade at all times if you have to cut

47
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,288
the end of a piece of wood your hand is

48
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:11,090
far enough of the blade so you have no

49
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,049
problem but if you have to cut the wood

50
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,000
lengthwise if you get any closer to the

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,180
blade you have to use a piece of wood of

52
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,510
a tool like this to push the wood you

53
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,849
cannot use your hand and the other

54
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,530
important thing is of course if you have

55
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,120
small pieces you always have to use a

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,370
piece of wood to push it the most

57
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,340
important thing is never be tempted to

58
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,889
stand behind the blade let's say if you

59
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:38,720
cut and it's a long piece and you're

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,489
tempted to pull it from the other side

61
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:44,900
so if this made some cut and it never

62
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,720
stand behind it and try to pull it

63
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,630
because the blade if anything gets stuck

64
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,819
the blade will pull the wood and your

65
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:55,819
hand in this direction into the blade so

66
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,010
you never stand behind the blade in a

67
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,090
table saw and you always walk from this

68
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,060
side and you always keep your hands very

69
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,549
far of the blade using this some kind of

70
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:09,470
tool even if the blade appears nearly

71
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,870
stopped so that's about it there's no

72
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,680
special yeah it's unexpected safety

73
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,250
things it's pretty obvious ok

74
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,620
the next machine we'll cover there is

75
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,040
all kinds of grinders this is a tool

76
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,500
grinder but all kind of grinders have

77
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,870
one thing in common there is a very

78
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,329
brittle wheel turning at very high

79
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,700
speeds typically 3600 rpm now this wheel

80
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,739
which looks very strong is actually very

81
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,990
brittle so if I take a pea

82
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:47,620
so far we like this okay so you can see

83
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,040
you can see that one sharp blow it's a

84
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,500
wheel when it's turning will cause it to

85
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,320
share there and fly so the first rule of

86
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,110
any grinding is you never stand in front

87
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,760
of the wheel if you need to guide

88
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,430
something you stand on this side or you

89
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,710
stand on this side but you never stand

90
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:12,320
straight okay because over your lifetime

91
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,570
you will have the chance to see a wheel

92
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,269
shatter at least once and it flies just

93
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,230
like a bullet okay so just a few simple

94
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,270
notes about using hand tools

95
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,940
there isn't much safety hazard in using

96
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,300
hand tools as the biggest hazard is when

97
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,700
hammering and also these are a

98
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,620
prescription safety glasses when you

99
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,190
hammer or chisel it's better in two it's

100
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,960
better to have goggles even if even if

101
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,190
they are safety glasses okay and the

102
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,320
first rule you have when your hammer

103
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,800
sinks is never to hit hard steel on

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,550
Howard steel now the face of the hammer

105
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,710
is hard steel otherwise you'll get

106
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,520
destroyed very quickly so all the tools

107
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,070
which are designed to be hammered on a

108
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,920
very soft end where the hammer hits in a

109
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,410
hard end and you can tell it if you try

110
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,630
to fight this end you find out right

111
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,180
away it's soft and this is hardened the

112
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,630
soft end eventually mushrooms on being

113
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,400
deformed and from time to time you have

114
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,800
to grind off the mushroom so no path

115
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,370
will fall off now the reason why you

116
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,240
can't hit hard on hard because a huge

117
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,360
stress develops at the point you're

118
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,150
hitting and a piece of metal can fly off

119
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,480
and the piece of metal can contain most

120
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,660
of the energy of the hammer blow and

121
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,220
this energy is enough of this piece of

122
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,100
metal to penetrate your body so you

123
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,690
never hammer hard on hard

124
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,580
now what happens if you have to

125
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,250
sometimes it is some situation say you

126
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,470
have to indent something with it with a

127
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,340
ball

128
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,410
and you have to hit hard on hard and you

129
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,540
have no choice and if this is the case

130
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,670
you always hit it too a piece of soft

131
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,380
material so if I wanted to deform this

132
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,750
into the shape of the ball and the ball

133
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,760
is hard because it's a ball bearing and

134
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,840
the hammer is hard

135
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,120
I would always hammer it like this a

136
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,850
piece of soft because then this will

137
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,970
indent and this would not chip so that's

138
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,640
a very important rule if you don't know

139
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,070
if something is happened or not there is

140
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,830
two easy ways to find out one easy ways

141
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,840
to try to file it a bit because you can

142
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,930
tell right away if you file it a bit if

143
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,810
it is soft or hard like these things you

144
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,340
cannot file at all of course the five

145
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,680
slips on them if you don't have a file

146
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,780
handy you can quickly see if something

147
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,810
is hard or not by dropping it on a hard

148
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,930
surface unknown how the surface and see

149
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,570
how much it bounces so for example if I

150
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,200
drop this on the surface it doesn't

151
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,890
bounce at all now now if I drop this

152
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,930
piece which is made of the same steel

153
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,870
but it's hardened it bounces a little

154
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,100
bit not much but if I drop this ball on

155
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,650
the same surface it bounces almost of

156
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,110
the same height so the fastest way if

157
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,480
you are not sure you just try to hit the

158
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,260
surface with it and feel the bounce like

159
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,830
this bounces back quite nicely

160
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,540
this doesn't bounce back little bit yeah

161
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,520
this is semi hard it's not completely

162
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,230
soft as always will default do quickly

163
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,960
but it's not nearly as hard as this end

164
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,540
so one way or other you have to be aware

165
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,580
if what you're dealing with is hardened

166
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,040
or not and if it's hardened you don't

167
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,680
hit it with the handle okay it lays is a

168
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,290
fairly safe machine but still there is

169
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,770
two unexpected dangers when working with

170
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,950
the lays the first unexpected danger is

171
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,960
if there is any thread and you put your

172
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,700
finger inside when the lace

173
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,880
terms it will pull your finger in and

174
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,310
shear it off so for example there is a

175
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,000
thread here and if you are just tempted

176
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,680
to clean out the thread let's say you

177
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,080
just cut this thread you're tempted to

178
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,840
clean it out and you say take your egg

179
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,810
put it on your finger and do this when

180
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,020
it turns it will actually pull your

181
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,370
finger in you wouldn't be able to take

182
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,050
it out and shear it off and I can

183
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,790
demonstrate it with a piece of wood so

184
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,900
if this is turning and this is my finger

185
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,179
and if I just touch this thread that's

186
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:40,100
it now it liked it it locked it inside

187
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,880
it sided on it I can't get it out again

188
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,500
okay so it's a very very dangerous thing

189
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
to do to put your finger or hand inside

190
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,320
the thread it is a bit less dangerous

191
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,140
but also very dangerous to touch the

192
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,570
outside of rotating sinks with a piece

193
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,330
of rag because the rag can get wrapped

194
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,470
around and pull your hand in for example

195
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,770
if I have if I have an external thread

196
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:10,370
and while it's turning I just want to

197
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,070
clean it it's a good chance this will

198
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,050
wrap around pull your hand into the

199
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,190
lathe and I will just let it go I

200
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,130
wouldn't let it happen but I just let it

201
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,710
go but just to show you if this is going

202
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,680
to make it slower so if this is if this

203
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,040
is turning and I try to clean it you can

204
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,110
easily write around once itself and ring

205
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,120
around it just close your hand into the

206
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,760
machine so I let it go but if it happens

207
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,290
suddenly you'll be pulled into the

208
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,980
machine okay now obviously when you walk

209
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,960
with the lace you don't have to have any

210
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,750
loose sleeves which can wrap around you

211
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,590
can't have any ear phone wires hanging

212
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,630
you can't have anything hanging off you

213
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,210
long hair or anything hanging off you

214
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,950
which can touch a rotating part will

215
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,770
wrap around and once it wraps around its

216
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,720
tenacious because you get a capstan

217
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,270
effect it locks and once it wraps around

218
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,130
you can never let go you get pulled into

219
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,830
the machine for example if I if I wrap

220
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,100
this around

221
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:20,140
like this okay so if I pull it if it's

222
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,060
wrapped out a bit more I can't pull it

223
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,130
off it just locks into the machine and I

224
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,350
can't pull it so the machine will pull

225
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,740
me in no matter what I do I'll get

226
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,400
pulled into the machine so so that's the

227
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,460
first rule of safety never attach

228
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,640
anything go tating with any legs or

229
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,320
hands or anything which can be cooled

230
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,250
into the machine

231
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,700
the second unexpected danger in a lathe

232
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,490
is when working with brass brass has a

233
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,270
very nasty property of pulling the tool

234
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,690
into the brass now normally there is a

235
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,390
special set of tools which is ground for

236
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,020
brass and these tools have a zero rake

237
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,510
angle so in other words the cutting edge

238
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,960
is touching the brass square not at a

239
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,870
sharp angle and same for drills drills

240
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,010
which are used for brass they there is a

241
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,310
flat a flat ground at the end of the

242
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,030
drill so the helix angle doesn't make a

243
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,370
sharp angle with the surface but it's

244
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,040
ground flat so it the end is gone flat

245
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,950
to be Square to the surface of the brass

246
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,100
in order not to pull in now if you don't

247
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,400
do that at the lace tool can be pulled

248
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,680
into the Chuck of the drill can pull out

249
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,920
the drilling chuck into the brass so let

250
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,760
me demonstrate that

251
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,209
okay okay so what what what happened

252
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:58,649
here the drill pulled out the check from

253
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:01,109
the tailstock and now instead of the

254
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:04,379
chuck being stationary it is spinning

255
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,959
with this Chuck and if this hole was

256
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,029
deep air it will pull it out all the way

257
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,129
and make it fly out so watch one more

258
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,499
time for one second that this chuck it

259
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,220
was actually got pulled out and it's now

260
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,329
spinning in the tailstock so if I move

261
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:24,239
back the tailstock I see that the chuck

262
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:27,109
was actually left stuck in the part and

263
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:31,379
now if I spin it it will fly out okay as

264
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:34,709
far as safety on a drill press it's a

265
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,859
fairly safe machine the only care you

266
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:40,919
have to take is clamping the part so

267
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,649
let's say if I want to drill a hole here

268
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:45,209
or any shape like this I can easily

269
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:49,769
clamp it you usually start a hole with a

270
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:55,279
center drill okay so let's say here

271
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,800
because the center mark itself is not

272
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,420
always enough to guide the drill

273
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,550
especially if it's a large drill so you

274
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,620
start the hole with the center drill and

275
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,060
you follow it up to the right sized

276
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,170
drill if the drill is very large say

277
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,530
larger than say ten millimeters it's

278
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,870
best to drill it in two steps first

279
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,970
we'll half the diameter and then enlarge

280
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,780
it to the full diameter and that's about

281
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,680
it so so this part is very simple now

282
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,960
the problem starts when the part you

283
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,020
have is too awkward to put in device

284
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,170
let's say you have a big sheet or some

285
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,450
odd shape you cannot put in device and

286
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,790
you have to hold it when you drill into

287
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,210
it for example if this was an awkward

288
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,790
shape and I couldn't put in the vise the

289
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,800
most important thing is try not to hold

290
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,570
it in your hands because it can always

291
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,730
catch the drill and start spinning and

292
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,410
if it has sharp edges it'll cut your

293
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,750
hand so if you have no choice if you

294
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,450
can't put it in the vise so the best

295
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,660
thing to do is hold it not with regular

296
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,000
pliers but with some kind of a locking

297
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,100
plier like a vise grip and assuming it's

298
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,130
as a center mark and everything drill it

299
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,110
not too fast again so if something

300
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,170
happens it doesn't happen too fast and

301
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,640
then you can drill it like this okay a

302
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,470
the same demo I gave you about the

303
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,990
dangers of drilling brass also exists

304
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,320
here if this was a piece of brass and I

305
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,690
drilled through it as soon as it really

306
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,850
blocks of the brass it will pull it up

307
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,180
so if this piece is not very secure it

308
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,510
can pull out of the vise or the chuck

309
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,670
can pull out if it doesn't have a bar

310
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,620
which threads into it can pull out of

311
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,170
the drill press so everything to do is

312
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,090
drilling brass on a lathe also applies

313
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,390
on a drill press another unexpected

314
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,030
danger on drilling in a drill press is

315
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,030
some people want to protect the surface

316
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,400
of what they are drilling and they put a

317
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,760
rag under it and

318
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,010
it turns out is a very very dangerous

319
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:13,390
procedure because when you put a rag

320
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,090
under what you are drilling as soon as

321
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,670
it will break through it's going to

322
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,590
touch the rag and the rag is going to be

323
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,440
wrapped on the drill so if you have a

324
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,790
rag and it will touches it you see this

325
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,800
and then this is the probability of this

326
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,450
happening is exactly 100 percent okay so

327
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,640
anytime you put a rag under something

328
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,320
that I could be trapped in the drill and

329
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,350
everything will fly so never put never

330
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,540
put anything which can wrap around the

331
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,930
drill under the material or drilling so

332
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,400
if you want to protect it just use a

333
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,830
sheet of paper because the same thing

334
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,280
doesn't happen with paper it's if you if

335
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,990
you want to protect something in your

336
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,210
foot paper the drill will just go

337
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,360
through the paper but the paper will not

338
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,070
appear on the drill because it doesn't

339
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,900
have fibers which can wrap around the

340
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,830
drill so although we talked already

341
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,010
about safety with press as before I want

342
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,710
to repeat the warning because a press is

343
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,260
a very deceptive machine it looks very

344
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,050
safe because everything moves slow but

345
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,630
it creates huge forces and huge stored

346
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,060
energy in very high dangerous if you

347
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,980
don't know what you're doing so for

348
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,960
example if I have a piece of house and

349
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,470
steel like this this is about the same

350
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,190
weight as say in a crossbow the amount

351
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,070
of steel in the bowl now everybody knows

352
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,660
that if you shoot an arrow from a

353
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,850
crossbow made of this steel it can kill

354
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,150
you but that still is a crossbow can

355
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,370
store normal energies and this piece of

356
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,670
steel can store when it's compressed up

357
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,300
to the limit of fracture so actually if

358
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,010
you compress it it can store more energy

359
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,320
than if you made a crossbow out of it

360
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,930
because in a crossbow the middle is that

361
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,579
the neutral plane it's not it doesn't

362
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:09,160
carry energy doesn't store energy so not

363
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,650
all the steel in the gospel stores

364
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,569
energy equally well if you compress it

365
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,660
the whole volume stores energy so if I

366
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,440
put this in a hundred pounds

367
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,890
and I compress it and say steel

368
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,619
typically would stand 10 tons per square

369
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,630
centimeter so if this is 10 square

370
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,990
centimeters compressing 100 ton press I

371
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,230
can shatter it so the moment it shatters

372
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,660
the energy will be released

373
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,460
usually it fractures along some

374
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,950
diagonals and the pieces fly out just

375
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,290
like bullets from a handgun by the way

376
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,930
with a comparable energy of bullets on a

377
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,560
small handgun because of that if you

378
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,810
cannot press hard materials now if you

379
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,020
have to press hard materials against

380
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,570
each other for some reason your a you

381
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,800
can never even come close to the limit

382
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,440
of the strength of the material and you

383
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,580
always should have a bulletproof guard

384
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,980
like this half inch lexan with no penny

385
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:17,030
fragments because because if you if you

386
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,730
press a hard no brittle material here

387
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,900
beyond its maximum compressive strength

388
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,360
it's guaranteed to share them so it's a

389
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,250
hundred to some probability it'll

390
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,750
shatter and pieces will fly out at you

391
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,820
now so be aware before you bend

392
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,400
something that it's actually material

393
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,190
which is bendable so it's not hardened

394
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,280
steel it's not 7000 series aluminum it

395
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,130
is not a spring temple beryllium copper

396
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,060
it's not

397
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,070
none of the materials which will break

398
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:56,120
instead of bending okay it suddenly

399
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,030
jumps up very rapidly now imagine if you

400
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,040
had a big sheet of this aluminum and

401
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,380
you're holding it it will jump up and

402
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,680
fly in your face and as you can see it

403
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,930
didn't actually Bend the piece just

404
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,960
shattered into and this piece just

405
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,380
shattered
