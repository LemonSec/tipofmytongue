1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,120
okay the next machine is a break or the

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,750
press break now this is set

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,890
at this side is regular bends this side

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,830
is all kinds of custom bends and custom

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,010
tooling and this side is just flattening

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,310
dice and other words at the undo button

7
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:32,330
for long bends okay and so say if I'm

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,370
going to bend this so here you set it up

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,230
on a digital gauge some machine have a

10
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,830
manual gauge which is just as good so

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:50,079
here I type in a band let's say

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:07,750
Pete okay so it's just men now I can as

13
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,780
I said I can I do it but it's not going

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,570
to make a perfect flat again because

15
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,759
this needs enormous pressures to making

16
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,340
a metal flow again so if you want if you

17
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,200
had to undo it and it had to be nicely

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,890
done

19
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,049
you left to anneal it you have to take a

20
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,899
butane torch at least heat it up to

21
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:28,539
red-hot and then it will undo if you

22
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:36,000
just undo like this it will leave a mark

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
there's a ridge here and it is

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,960
surprising that even with a hundred ton

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,450
press likes a big press a or you can be

26
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,700
able to get rid of the smoke but if you

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,830
anneal it before we did it it will undo

28
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,319
nicely one reason is because it walk

29
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,020
hardens so it's harder to flee now what

30
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,299
you you notice a few things here first

31
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:00,640
of all I'm using what's called a

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,799
gooseneck tool instead of the regular

33
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,130
tool and I'll show you the profile the

34
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,920
gooseneck tool has this profile regular

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,130
tool is just V at the bottom the

36
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,440
advantage of this it allows you to bend

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,730
narrow channels because you can bend so

38
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,269
in a moment

39
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,080
if you wanted in general with a break

40
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,680
you can only bend the U which is wider

41
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,680
than its depths otherwise you will

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,800
interfere it will hit here okay but if

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,450
you were if you want to bend the narrow

44
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,200
channel say 10 by 10 by 10 millimeter if

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,129
you have a gooseneck tool the channel

46
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:50,200
can end up with the last Bend like this

47
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,900
to wrap around and you can make them a

48
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,010
narrower channel so since in prototyping

49
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,620
at least and what I do a lot of parts

50
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,319
are small it's preferable to have a

51
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,660
gooseneck tool so you can make a narrow

52
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,880
channel yes is that with that one with a

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,549
hole in it is well the one with the hole

54
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,829
is to make deeper channels and if you

55
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:13,930
have to make yourself with the waterjet

56
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,239
and all these cuts are done with the

57
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,760
water jet so you to save money you buy

58
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,370
one long bow and then you cut it up with

59
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,650
the water jet and you have like a 1 inch

60
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,810
piece a 2-inch pieces range P so

61
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,380
actually if you are smart you do it in

62
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,850
some binary all there so you have a

63
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,489
minimum number of pieces you don't get

64
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:36,430
to any dimension you want ok and then

65
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,170
you make a few special pieces like the

66
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,970
one with a hole which allows you to bend

67
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,810
a very deep you okay now something else

68
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,450
which is useful is a table which you can

69
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,819
make or buy ok and the reason is

70
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:52,030
sometimes you have very narrow strips so

71
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,470
if I had a strip will exist for example

72
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,730
okay and I can only touch it to one stop

73
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,310
I don't know if it's square or not

74
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,880
so to bend narrow stuff I need some kind

75
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,610
of a table with marks so this one goes

76
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,180
like this you don't have to make it as

77
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,709
fence this and now I can line it up with

78
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,589
the marks on the table okay so if I want

79
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,800
to bet - for example bend deep you like

80
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,800
I said before like this if I have this

81
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,370
hole here I can bend something which is

82
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,790
deeper than it's wide okay

83
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,780
that's what this is for

84
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,759
good now a house Iike metal you can bend

85
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,770
depends how wide it is because it's

86
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,580
brass break this one is 25 tons so 24

87
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,560
tons we say limit will be 2 band full

88
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,639
weeds about gauge 12 say bit under 3

89
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,530
millimeter so this is with this die

90
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,650
of course if use a wider V it can bend

91
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,259
sick of stuff so there's actually three

92
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,360
parameters one is the thickness of the

93
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,750
material one is it weeds and one it's

94
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,639
the opening of the die because if you

95
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,590
want to bend very sick stuff you need to

96
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,039
die with wider opening so in order not

97
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,650
to have to change tools all the time

98
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,930
it's best thing is to leave it always

99
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,860
with a 3/4 inch die because this will

100
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,530
allow you to bend quite sick stuff in

101
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,130
narrow sections and as I said about two

102
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,530
and half three millimeters stuff on the

103
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,139
full width this is for steel aluminum of

104
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:48,080
course you can bet more okay so for

105
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,849
example this is three and a half

106
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,070
millimeter steel so certainly is no

107
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,740
problem to bend the narrow piece with

108
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,190
this die

109
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,410
okay now the break comes with a

110
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,740
readjustment if you want to bend less

111
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,900
than 90 degrees which is quite

112
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,180
inconvenient because you have to run and

113
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,180
adjust it so I added a font adjustment

114
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,090
which is just an air valve which shuts

115
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,620
off the air when it reaches the right

116
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,950
tips so if I want to be and say less

117
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,650
than 90 degrees which I want to bend 45

118
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,080
or something I'm just shut up there

119
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,680
earlier so I can put it back this way so

120
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,690
they've made a very light Bend I can't

121
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:45,180
go a bit more so basically I can adjust

122
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,210
for other than 90 degrees by adjusting

123
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,100
the veil which is much simpler than

124
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,220
dealing with the back adjustment if you

125
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,710
don't want a sharp bend like a head

126
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,370
before so if you wanted the radius band

127
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,920
all you have to do is bend first a piece

128
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,460
of scrap and use it to give a radius to

129
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,350
the die sometimes just for aesthetics

130
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,100
and you like a radius ends so you have a

131
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:17,480
whole set of radius tools okay and

132
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:24,060
usually it's a good idea to put magnets

133
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,480
in them that they stick to this so this

134
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,940
one I think the magnets fell out so

135
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,580
anyway so you can still do it so if I

136
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,550
want to blend this with the radius I'll

137
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,010
just put it in here like this

138
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,380
and if you like I would have to hold it

139
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,300
now because I want to remain

140
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,030
and access okay so now it will give you

141
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,470
around append you want these fingers of

142
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,150
course to be narrow the ways are

143
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,570
supplied with a break but if there are

144
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,650
too wide they cannot come in and

145
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,830
narrower than this beep but if they are

146
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,530
narrow to come in when they are far away

147
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,960
and you put in the path you can miss the

148
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,950
fingers so a very useful modification is

149
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,130
actually to put a sliding cube over the

150
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,340
finger so close by the tube slides back

151
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,290
and you can come in with a very narrow

152
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,080
finger to make very narrow bends and if

153
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,730
you're far away you have the whole area

154
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,360
of the tube to rest on so let me just

155
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,030
point this modification out because it's

156
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,390
very useful so I just move it healed

157
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,539
where we can see so originally it comes

158
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,850
with a round bar but what you do you

159
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,980
narrow down the round valve as much as

160
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,470
you want and then you put a sliding tube

161
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,110
over it and the sliding tube stops

162
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,380
exactly flush with a round bow so you

163
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,110
can actually push in this tongue all the

164
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,440
way in and the tube stays behind very

165
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,930
quick them about brackets brackets are

166
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,260
very very common so if I want to make it

167
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,060
I think we'll break it out of this piece

168
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:13,870
I can do it like this but then I find

169
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,410
out the bracket is quite flimsy so

170
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,770
there's a few ways I can make it rigid

171
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,160
the simplest way is I just take a brace

172
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,460
like this I just just bend the brace

173
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,790
spot-welded heel and the best idea is

174
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,140
because I'm not sure if that's accurate

175
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,560
I hold it against the square I hold it

176
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,290
against the square and spot weld heel so

177
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,380
that's the simplest type of bracket the

178
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,440
second type of bracket is I just take a

179
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,670
triangular stiffener piece which I bent

180
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,330
the two sides

181
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,330
put the triangular piece into the

182
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,110
bracket and spot-weld here I don't need

183
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,390
the square because they the triangular

184
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,200
piece itself is been square now if you

185
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,470
if you are short of space and you Esper

186
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,269
and if you want to make very simple

187
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:14,089
brackets which are stiff air what you

188
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:17,120
can do is you can bend into them a rib

189
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,750
so first let me bend so let me bend the

190
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,279
rib into it and then I'll explain how

191
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,310
you do it so let's say I bend it again

192
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:33,579
here but this time I bent a rib into it

193
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,519
and the way it's done is I leave a space

194
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,050
on the break between two segments it's

195
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,660
desirable to minutely round the corner

196
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,089
and I put in a blade which has a rounded

197
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:54,010
just take it out oops I put on a

198
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,589
hardened steel blade which has around

199
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:58,430
the top

200
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,480
this has to be hardened okay and I put

201
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,500
it in to be about flash with a die so

202
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,149
now well it makes a bend it also puts a

203
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:18,140
ribbon okay

204
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,690
and that rib it's very very simple and

205
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,970
gives it immense stiffness for example

206
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,490
if I take this thing now and squeeze it

207
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,190
or if I hold it like this and squeeze it

208
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,130
you can see that most of the flex most

209
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,410
of the flex will be at the unsafe and

210
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,709
part so if I start bending it down you

211
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:39,709
can see the unsafe and part Bend the two

212
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:44,560
stiffened parts bent very little
