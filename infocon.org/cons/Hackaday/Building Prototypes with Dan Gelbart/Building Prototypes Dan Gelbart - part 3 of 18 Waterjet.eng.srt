1
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,339
okay so we'll go over all the machines

2
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:15,910
you need to make the prototype as I

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,550
mentioned the key machine is a water jet

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,869
cutter this is an all Mack's 26:54 water

5
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:26,410
jet cutter now this is the only

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,450
expensive piece of equipment you

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,378
actually need the poor man's version of

8
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:35,770
this would be a plasma cutter a CNC

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,110
plasma cutter like the ones made by

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,409
torch mate a plasma cutter is about

11
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,539
one-tenth of the cost and one tenth of

12
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:46,300
the operating cost and a water jet but

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,480
it's much less versatile because it

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,030
course doesn't cut as well and can only

15
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,729
cut metals and doesn't cut all metals

16
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:57,280
equally well a water jet can cut

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,100
practically anything up to two inch

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,550
thickness or more and cuts beautifully

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,740
so the ideal machine is a water jet but

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,409
sometimes because of budget reasons for

21
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,840
home use or whatever there you can do a

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,159
lot of the things I'm talking about

23
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,320
today you can also do the CNC plasma

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,920
cutter

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,500
okay so the first thing is the

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,830
modifications you need to do to improve

27
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,280
a productivity the most important

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,220
modification is to add a sliding basket

29
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,380
because when you cut out small parts

30
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,360
they drop into the tank

31
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,790
sometimes even big parts have surprising

32
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,979
ways to tip over the sleds and drop into

33
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,440
the tanks and once it drops into the

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,440
tank which is full of discarded garnet

35
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,600
it's basically lost the chances of

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,700
retrieving it if you ever tried are very

37
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,490
low so the first thing you have to do is

38
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,590
you have to make a moving basket and

39
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,310
I'll show it here and the basket is

40
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,240
resting on the bottom part of the you

41
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,600
beam which is holding the sleds now the

42
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,050
reason it sank below to be far enough on

43
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,050
the jet not to be cut by the jet has to

44
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,788
be about eight inches of twenty

45
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:14,330
centimeters below the top of the sled in

46
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,380
order not to be cut now you can move the

47
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,220
basket by pulley and you can pick it up

48
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,430
take it out and find all the little part

49
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,280
you lost and also recovered a lot of

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,769
parts you can be reused for other things

51
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,440
like slag metal slugs it just

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,240
now the basket just sits on the cradle

53
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,100
and just sits on the cradle you drop it

54
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,130
in and you're moving back to position

55
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,130
now for sheet metal if you don't have a

56
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,250
basket you can leave sinks hanging of a

57
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,160
tap and break them off but unfortunately

58
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,410
anything sicker than say an eighth of an

59
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,080
inch this method doesn't walk because if

60
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,720
you have a half-inch steel plate and you

61
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,580
leave things hanging on a tab you can't

62
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,920
break them off so basically you have to

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,030
have this basket to save time the second

64
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,940
modification which is very desirable is

65
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,610
to have some way to know where the beam

66
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,000
will hit and the best way I found is a

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,570
laser pointer which shines through the

68
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,210
beam passes a jet and shows where the

69
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,300
beam will hit and I understand this will

70
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,240
be available from the omics Corporation

71
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,120
but right now this is a homemade one so

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,070
it's just like a normal laser pointer

73
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,100
accepted right angles it's precisely

74
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,670
made

75
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,020
it's precisely made so it fits exactly

76
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,900
where the fee tube you pull out the fee

77
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,680
tube you plug in exactly where the feed

78
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,150
tube goes and to keep the nozzle clean

79
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,460
from water you plug it into an air

80
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,110
supply okay I'll just hold up a piece of

81
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,330
paper so you can see this part of the

82
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,310
video much better so you can see the

83
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,890
laser point of spot coming out the

84
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,530
places spot will hit the metal is where

85
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,660
the jet will hit the metal because it's

86
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,870
going to st. V tube that's a second

87
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,720
benefit the shape of the spot also

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,760
measures the way around the mixing tube

89
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,830
so just by looking at the shape of the

90
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,480
spot you know if you have to replace the

91
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,580
mixing tube or not so

92
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,280
this is especially important if you had

93
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,800
to stop a job for any reason and then

94
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,870
start cutting for where you left off

95
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,240
before it's very important to align the

96
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,240
beam second place it's important when

97
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,850
you have to mix some precision holes

98
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,970
with waterjet holes and so you have to

99
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,730
register the cutting to pre-existing

100
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,620
features like big holes so you use this

101
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,460
now this chap here to go from splashes I

102
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,740
found out that the best cap is actually

103
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,990
half of a tennis ball and that's what

104
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,390
this is which is much better than any of

105
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,940
the caps supplied to the machine the

106
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,620
reason why it's better it takes very

107
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,420
little space so you can come very close

108
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,670
to the edge and you can flip it over

109
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,430
very easily to see what's going on so

110
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,430
one good modification is to add clamps

111
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,470
like this for example that you can just

112
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,110
tighten down these clamps obviously are

113
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,990
cut on the water jet so takes no time to

114
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,300
make them and they go from zero to one

115
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,940
inch and bigger stuff in one inch is

116
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,740
heavy enough that you don't really need

117
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,330
clamping it will sit from its own weight

118
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,780
okay so a quick demo of something very

119
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,320
inexpensive and useful called a plasma

120
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,860
cutter over air plasma cutter

121
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,940
get it out this is a top unit it's very

122
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,630
light all that it needs is compressed

123
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,170
air and regular power household power if

124
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,420
you have a water jet cutter alone most

125
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,040
of the time you never use it

126
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,560
but you still need it sometimes if you

127
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,840
want to cut a hole in a box or an

128
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,640
enclosure which is too big to fit into

129
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,680
the water jet let's say you're working

130
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,960
on a car you're working on a cabinet you

131
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,450
can't drag it into a water jet but you

132
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,400
still need to cut out a well-defined

133
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,950
hole so what you do is you cut out on

134
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,040
the water jet a template allowing for

135
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,260
the oversize allowing for the fact that

136
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,220
there is a diameter here of the nozzle

137
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,160
so you cut an oversized template clamps

138
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,890
the template is a cabinet order you want

139
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,170
to cut and use it just you follow it

140
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,260
with this now if your template is steel

141
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,050
sometimes a good idea to insulate this

142
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,060
tip so it doesn't electrically touch the

143
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,430
template and also keep some distance

144
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,620
from the material you cut because you're

145
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,180
supposed to keep a very small distance

146
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,880
or the material you cut so it's the best

147
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,970
thing to do is machine a ceramic tip to

148
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,330
go on it I know if I don't have one I'm

149
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,470
just wrapping up some tape around it and

150
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,840
that will be good enough just to cut one

151
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:31,690
part sit like this good enough so what

152
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,140
is does it transfer the arc from an

153
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,630
internal arc to the work piece so if I

154
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,440
ground the work piece okay first you see

155
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,780
a butane bottle here which is not a good

156
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,390
idea to have what we are going to make

157
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:55,330
sparks so and again for a it's the you

158
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,550
have to have goggles not only because of

159
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,820
sparks okay but also because of intense

160
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,760
UV this emits a lot of UV now these

161
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,760
glasses are actually UV filter so it's

162
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,150
okay

163
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,710
so such precisely the cut is not nice

164
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,890
because my hand isn't steady but if you

165
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,220
set the same torch on a CNC table the

166
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,650
cut it's quite nice not as nice as water

167
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,660
jet but completely acceptable for sheet

168
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,169
metal work so if I wanted to cut a hole

169
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,849
here and I couldn't take it to the water

170
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,150
jet I would make a template let's say

171
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:42,099
this is a template and I would clip it

172
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,320
heel to ground it of the template but

173
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,300
I'll use one of these strange shapes

174
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,180
this is a template you have to somehow

175
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,880
clip it so you can still reach it with a

176
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,550
gun see I can hold it with another piece

177
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,010
of sleeve from the other side because

178
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,340
yeah if you have to be able to go around

179
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,390
the template and

180
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,510
okay so

181
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,709
and knocks it out so it didn't do the

182
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,430
greatest job because I didn't go steady

183
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,250
but but you can see I copy that shape so

184
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,769
that's quite a useful thing for quick

185
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:51,620
and dirty walk especially considering is

186
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,420
that the whole machine is about a

187
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,610
thousand bucks or less so very

188
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,320
inexpensive we will cut out two

189
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,180
quarter-inch steel the bigger ones will

190
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,660
cut up to 3/4 inch steel it will cut

191
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,970
stainless aluminum but of course will

192
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,269
not cut non metallics will not cut well

193
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:10,519
cocktail of materials which conducts the

194
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,050
heat away very fast and so on
