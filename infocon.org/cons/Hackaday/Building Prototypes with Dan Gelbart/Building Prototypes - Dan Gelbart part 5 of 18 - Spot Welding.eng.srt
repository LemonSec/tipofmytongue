1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,520
so the second machine will cover it

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,240
one is a homemade one but they all look

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,890
more or less the same so first thing you

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,230
have to do is when you want sheet metal

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,770
you have to set the time usually the

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,720
setting for time some machines are both

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,820
are setting for pressure the pressure

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,710
setting you can ignore set it for

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,590
maximum and leave Excel but the time

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,840
setting you have to carefully set based

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,030
on the thickness of the metal and the

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,390
wrong it is a test is you take you take

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,860
two pieces of metal and what you do is

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,380
you put make a few words at different

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,450
times and then check which is the right

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:50,960
one

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,430
okay so this is about point seven

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,920
millimeter or maybe catch-22 sheet metal

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,099
so we'll start we start with the setting

20
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,079
of two cycles okay

21
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,780
now this in Sparks so you need goggles

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,240
or unless your glasses it's good enough

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,430
and this thing if you set the wrong

24
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,219
setting will drink molten metals or no

25
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:18,020
sandals because it'll melt the piece

26
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,850
very important in general in shop nose

27
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,850
handles okay so so we did a bunch of

28
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,960
wells first we started with you okay so

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,679
we so you do a set of test words to

30
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:33,499
determine the right current start with

31
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:37,580
two cycles then we go

32
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,890
three cycles four cycles that should be

33
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,390
enough okay now to do a tour test and

34
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,120
the test is the metal has to care

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,760
without the weld opening and then you

36
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,700
know that you have the right setting

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,160
so now let's zoom in and we starting the

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,740
terrace so the first well the two cycles

39
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,960
should be open the first well was good

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,789
enough actually you can see what

41
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,450
happened look at the metal tore out on

42
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,040
the whole without opening the web so

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,410
obviously two is right number one one is

44
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,160
too weak for sure but total right number

45
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,740
for the thickness if you change material

46
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,800
or sickness you have another setting so

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,020
after a few days you already know you

48
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,880
just look at the metal you already know

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,209
or you make a little chart here and you

50
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,760
need to chart one for stainless one for

51
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,989
mild steel this actually only welds well

52
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:48,500
my steel and stainless steel you can't

53
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,489
well non-ferrous metals okay you can

54
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:54,680
weld exotics tank stand

55
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,230
can you molybdenum all kinds of exotics

56
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,310
it's a rule you can only weld well

57
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,690
metals which don't conduct electricity

58
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,030
well because the way it works is by

59
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,000
passing a current I squared R if it

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,620
doesn't conduct electricity well it gets

61
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,860
very hot okay if it could well copper

62
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,660
well the electrode would well to each

63
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,650
other

64
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,590
so you need to charge one for stainless

65
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,810
and one for steel and you also need

66
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,879
extra places in the chart if you want to

67
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,519
wear studs or knots and so on now

68
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,040
something to notice on the spot world

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,230
there that you can make a temporary weld

70
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,940
in a permanent world which is very

71
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,819
convenient for prototyping so if I set

72
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,120
it for one so we found out two was

73
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,549
enough but if I set it for one it will

74
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,379
make a very weak weld which I can break

75
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,840
off with my hands which is very useful

76
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,849
for prototyping so if I want to position

77
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:51,510
something just even for a moment just

78
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,640
rather than one it's holding together

79
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,400
but I can twist it off and break it off

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,920
so it's a bit like a temporary versus

81
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,410
permanent glue if i weld it this is

82
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,720
second metal so if i weld it on to on

83
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,239
the thicker metal i can still break it

84
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,370
up

85
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,079
okay I can still break it off if I try

86
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,079
hard but if I went on three it's

87
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:15,060
permanent so this is kind of the limit

88
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,000
what I can see off if I welcome sweet

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,910
permanent so it's recommended that if

90
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,400
you are not sure you have some covers to

91
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,800
adjust hinges to adjust you tack weld on

92
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,750
a little setting you can easily twist

93
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,910
off once you're happy you go over the

94
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,610
words at the higher setting now if you

95
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,130
were living on the right setting

96
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,500
permanent setting and you have to open

97
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,200
the world if it's a single weld you can

98
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,000
maybe twist it like this if it's a

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,430
multiple well there's no way to twist it

100
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,310
so so don't even try to pry it off

101
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,010
because actually stress shows to tell

102
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,470
the metal so the only way to open it is

103
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,410
drill it out so you it's it makes a nice

104
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,780
Center mark for drilling so you pick a

105
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,389
drill the size of the spot typically

106
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,580
three four millimeter drill it out and

107
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,840
it's separate don't try other ways

108
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,520
if you get if you have is my Boulder

109
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,270
that has adjustable turn and time do you

110
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,850
want to be adjusting the hurry

111
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,410
okay get different well very good

112
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,820
question very good question you always

113
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,310
set it for the top comment and always

114
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,790
adjust the time unless the lowest time

115
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,560
setting is think too high and then you

116
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,870
lower the carpet because there is no

117
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,210
advantage in adjustable current at all

118
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,870
because the faster the current less heat

119
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,160
escapes sideways so the less energy need

120
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,830
to do a weld for example a laser well

121
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,350
there is super short times and in most

122
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,900
beautiful welds just because of that so

123
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,480
they what you want is to minimize the

124
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,450
time so that you maximize the carbon to

125
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,430
just play with the time but sometimes

126
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,060
for very same stuff one cycle is already

127
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,400
too long or one cycle to cycle it's too

128
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,100
cool you want one and a half cycles so

129
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,030
you go two cycles with less current but

130
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,940
this has adjustable current I built this

131
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,560
40 years ago I never used it works ok ok

132
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,360
so good so now

133
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,840
this one as I mentioned is this a 15 kV

134
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,840
a unit and that's about the minimum you

135
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,689
want you want a unit which is anywhere

136
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:35,639
from 15 to 25 kV a so 15 kV a will weld

137
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,199
something like three millimeter to three

138
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,750
millimeter or if you used to gauge as it

139
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,259
will weld like a gauge 12 to gauge 12 or

140
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,110
gauge 10 to gauge 10 and that's the

141
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,120
limit and for that you need like

142
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,389
something in the order of 15 cycles I

143
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,389
think and and that's it it wouldn't take

144
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,729
any secret staff that Styles up that's

145
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:03,400
about gauge 12 steel yeah that looks

146
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,990
like you wouldn't be able to peel it off

147
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,680
it's 216 but yeah yeah that's a good

148
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,560
world so so that's about the limit of

149
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,979
what it can do in stainless it will well

150
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:16,840
a little bit heavier

151
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,379
maybe gauge 10 to gauge 10 maybe a

152
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,659
little bit heavier and and if you had a

153
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:26,199
25 kV a unit go on gage say care but

154
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,029
that's it it's not designed to well sick

155
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:30,940
stuff luckily exactly where this range

156
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,210
ends is where it becomes very easy to

157
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,639
weld with the TIG welder because TIG

158
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,379
welder needs a lot of skill if you try

159
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,509
to well since stuff because you'll burn

160
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:42,969
a hole but once the material becomes at

161
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:45,159
C it's very easy to weld it to the TIG

162
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,469
well there even if you're inexperienced

163
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:49,150
so luckily exactly where there where

164
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,000
this ends TIG welding easy TIG welding

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,330
stops so there's no problem

166
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:01,240
now what it works very well is a road so

167
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,099
if you want to make something like this

168
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:06,729
which is made from wire it's ideal and

169
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:09,009
you can weld a half inch short or half

170
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:11,500
in short with this so it's actually a

171
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,470
very efficient in words one reason for

172
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,500
that because when you work towards you

173
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,780
have a very small contact area and

174
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,280
because you have a very small contact

175
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,500
area you have very high current density

176
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,349
so in the heat cannot escape in two

177
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:28,030
directions can only escape in one

178
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,490
direction along the rod so the welding

179
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,000
is much more efficient so even if if tkv

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,789
a unit will easily world creates odd and

181
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,000
well the even half each rod for example

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,680
even a low setting of five okay so the

183
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,120
quarter inch rod and a 3/16 rod to

184
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,490
welcome very nicely together maybe

185
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,970
that's a bit under welded but if not we

186
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,079
can increase the setting

187
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,730
and the test is the same you have to

188
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,559
twist the rod and if the world should

189
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,170
not open the lodge here same test that

190
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,410
sees it

191
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,340
this probably is and earlier I can still

192
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,330
twist but if I go if I went a bit

193
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,870
heavier on the curve and if I went say

194
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,020
to an aide it will break the body if I

195
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,250
do okay what spot well that is also very

196
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,670
useful for is to weld captive hardware

197
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,580
things like hinges nuts studs standoffs

198
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,920
another type of standard and all types

199
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,960
tab which will explain things like

200
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,050
latches closures there's a very wide

201
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,350
range of spot well double hardware you

202
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,280
can buy so let's demonstrate this okay

203
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,920
so you have to make yourself a set of

204
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,940
hollow electrodes to accept the standard

205
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,730
sizes of schools this is all metric so

206
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,790
this also for metric that m4 fits in

207
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:14,820
this now you'll notice that these all

208
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,880
these standoffs have a little ball and a

209
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,180
spring over the ball in order to hold

210
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,840
the captive hardware so it doesn't fall

211
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,730
out and you hold it vertically doesn't

212
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,690
fall out okay so you put it say like

213
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,110
this

214
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,060
and set it the number rate it's good

215
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,860
enough so if I needed here if I needed a

216
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,050
couple of studs for later on mounting

217
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,120
assemblies what you do is you have a

218
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,170
typically with the waterjet cutter

219
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,600
you'll make a little mark either by etch

220
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,880
commando or drill a 1 millimeter hole

221
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,340
but sometimes just an edge command is

222
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,220
enough because these tabs have a little

223
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,190
tip at the end a little point so what

224
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,520
you'll do is you just go and feel until

225
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,230
you feel the point and it falls into

226
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,360
place and that's what makes it accurate

227
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,530
you feel it locked in place ok so now

228
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,070
you have a stud and again if you are not

229
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,110
sure about the setting you do the

230
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,330
standard test it has to break the studs

231
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,400
without opening the well this one didn't

232
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,280
open the weld so to add to get go to

233
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,750
higher setting maybe a 10 okay so if you

234
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,020
don't have the special weld studs you

235
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,110
can use a standard round head school

236
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,490
either

237
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,010
Arlen or slot or Phillips any school is

238
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,080
around head works almost as well as a

239
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,450
stud except now we know we need a bit

240
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,130
more current security 12

241
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,560
okay

242
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:03,960
push in here okay okay and so now you

243
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,630
can see it's lended okay and then we do

244
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:16,080
it break first yeah you can seize it you

245
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,600
can see the stag block off without the

246
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,210
wind and then you know the setting as I

247
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,160
said eventually you build up a table you

248
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,080
stick it on the machine and you don't

249
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,420
have to do this test again okay now if

250
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,490
you want to put a thread on some part

251
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,589
you can buy those nuts which have three

252
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:41,700
projections called spot-welding nuts are

253
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,910
available in white selection in imperial

254
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,830
and and also more limited selection in

255
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,740
metric on the internet and the way they

256
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,870
do work with them they have a pilot

257
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,290
shoulder you cut a hole who has a pilot

258
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,080
fits in and this gives you the accuracy

259
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,130
and then you spot weld and it's possible

260
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,690
do it between two flat electrodes

261
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,380
so yeah

262
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,800
okay you aligned with the pilot

263
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,850
typically do it well for the high

264
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,010
setting because there's a large surface

265
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,320
areas a bit of a quantity of the high of

266
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,690
the second okay now you have a thread

267
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,550
sometimes sometimes you have to go and

268
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,700
clean these threads running a tab to

269
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,740
them because the wedding itself can

270
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,130
eject a metalic here it is the thread

271
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,720
now if you don't like salt so if you

272
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,150
don't have those you can always well

273
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,610
just a plain piece and then tap it

274
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,770
because usually sheet metal is too thin

275
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,140
to hold the thread but wherever you want

276
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,960
threads just weld a plain piece and of

277
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,930
course a water jet we cut holes there so

278
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,250
you don't have to drill it you just have

279
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,190
to take a warship let's say washer Wendy

280
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,990
to the back of this then you have double

281
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,050
thickness then you can tap it the other

282
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,030
way to do it is there are these inserts

283
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,220
which look like pop rivets which are

284
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,440
said inserts you just put the hole

285
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,000
through the water jet and the special

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,470
gun which puts in the insert

287
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,580
okay but the simplest way is it sews

288
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,050
because a low-profile are easy to use

289
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,930
another thing you use sometimes is

290
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,680
threaded standoffs and those are welded

291
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:35,149
like studs so this goes with the right

292
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:39,890
size for it let's go to this side so

293
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,209
this is a threaded standoff it fits in a

294
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:48,489
same holder which holds the studs

295
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,410
this

296
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,280
and now you have a stand of him now and

297
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,890
another piece of very useful captive

298
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,060
hardware is hinges let's go back to this

299
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,599
for a moment

300
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,450
so these you buy in long strips many

301
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,040
weeds available say for example

302
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,340
mcmaster-carr buy them online if you

303
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,130
need the box or the cover you just line

304
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,370
up the hinge like this close it is going

305
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:35,740
to close and setting we will normal

306
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:43,330
setting say for now you have a hinge so

307
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:49,830
if you take this take this hinged cover

308
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:55,360
okay as I said there are latches all

309
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,890
kinds of things something's very very

310
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,040
useful to weld is balls and the reason

311
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,900
for that is sometimes you need things

312
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,970
like kinematic mounts with three balls

313
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,930
register

314
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,270
sometimes you need bars with balls at

315
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,210
the end so actually it's very useful

316
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,610
thing to make couplings of adjustments

317
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,950
so all that you need to work balls is

318
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,700
make use of an electrode which has a

319
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,790
conical home exist

320
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:32,240
and indepence with two other electrodes

321
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,439
well as just world

322
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:38,370
balls two flats okay now because balls

323
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,350
are very cheap and very accurate you can

324
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,680
take advantage of them in all kind of

325
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,899
adjustments like for example arms which

326
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,720
have to move in all directions so for

327
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,939
example if I wanted to make an

328
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:53,730
adjustment where I have a rod which I

329
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,339
can move in any direction and lock the

330
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,290
easiest way to do that adjustment is to

331
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,290
weld a ball at the end of the rod put a

332
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,300
washer over it with two schools which

333
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,039
claims the ball down and then I can lock

334
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,369
it okay so for this I need to weld a

335
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:11,520
roll at the end of a rod and for that I

336
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,699
put the ball in a conical hole and I

337
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,030
have a special Colette adapter to grip

338
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,789
the road okay but you have to sing

339
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,289
carefully whether you'll be able to take

340
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:24,329
it out after you weld it so you have to

341
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,909
make sure that is enough space that you

342
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:28,950
can take this out and slide the ball out

343
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,799
down so the visible has to be smaller

344
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,890
than the hole here now other places you

345
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,870
need something simpler you just need a

346
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,409
ball welded here so it can see it and be

347
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,750
an omnidirectional P vote or a kinematic

348
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,250
mount so you just do this and setting is

349
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,470
a low setting normally because it's a

350
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,380
small contact area you just put this

351
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,169
here and now you have a ball coming out

352
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:59,790
here which is very convenient okay now

353
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,070
conical adapter does touch the ball in

354
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,790
one ring so but luckily it has so much

355
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,520
contact area that although it melts the

356
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,500
ball at the bottom it doesn't make any

357
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,050
mark on the ball so even if you look

358
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,860
very closely if there is enough contact

359
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,540
area between the copper and the ball

360
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,640
will be no marking at all on on the ball

361
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,730
okay another thing that you run into

362
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,760
spot welding is sometimes you don't want

363
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,580
the world to be visible let's say I want

364
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,680
to make something which has to be very

365
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,740
beautiful on the outside or sometimes

366
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,630
for other reasons if you make a medical

367
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,810
device for cleanliness reasons you don't

368
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,550
want anything on the outside which can

369
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,630
trap there oh so boss as many reasons

370
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,360
why you may not want to see so if you

371
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,540
look at the textbooks they say that's a

372
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,490
way to do it is to take one flat

373
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,940
electrode and one regular electrode but

374
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,950
when you try it you find out it doesn't

375
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,050
work because also this is a completely

376
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:11,260
flat electrode what it does the molten

377
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,810
metal when it solidifies pulls in a bit

378
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,780
and when you try to send it there is

379
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,580
still a mark the rest of this case the

380
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,250
mark is quite small but it's in because

381
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,560
it goes inwards you have to send the

382
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,650
whole surface to get it off so if you

383
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,840
want to get an invisible world is to

384
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,870
make a special electrode which actually

385
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,080
has a very small dimple at the weld

386
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,040
point and the dimple is maybe a few

387
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,260
millimeters in diameter and maybe 50

388
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,460
micron deep and what it does it pushes

389
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,490
the metal out into the dimple just by

390
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,890
the amount which squeeze shrinks back

391
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,720
when it cools down so you end up with a

392
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,800
perfectly flat surface okay if

393
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,410
send it us a little bit but it wouldn't

394
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,840
you you don't have at the worst you left

395
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,390
to send off a bump but it's much less

396
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,150
sendings and sending the whole surface

397
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,590
okay so that's how to make invisible

398
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:13,140
world now sometimes you are stuck and

399
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,150
you have to weld something which doesn't

400
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,390
want to weld like for example a lot of

401
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,240
stuff medical is done with nitinol which

402
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,310
is a wonderful material but you can

403
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,260
praise it you can solder it you can to

404
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,620
end it okay so what you do is you

405
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,020
usually trap it between two pieces of

406
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,780
stainless steel so the weld goes across

407
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,550
the night and all the two layers of

408
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,370
stainless and words everything together

409
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,790
for example this is a flexure hinge made

410
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,820
of 19 oh these are the type of hinges

411
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,910
that can go 90 degrees with zero wear

412
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,190
and geo lubrication act like a real

413
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,830
hinge so to give it a wide range of to

414
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,500
use 19 all but a nitinol you cannot spot

415
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,260
weld so we'll talk more about this when

416
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,390
we talk about flexes were basically well

417
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,930
smooth the stainless for example if I

418
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,620
have to weld some sleep of fossil bones

419
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,990
of the ilium copper which is very useful

420
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,090
material but it doesn't well because

421
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,430
it's a non ferrous material I can always

422
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,370
strap it between two layers of stainless

423
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,870
it's the same if I want to well the

424
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,630
night in a wire I can slide a stainless

425
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,330
steel hypodermic cubing over it and then

426
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,010
it will well so the nitinol so so here

427
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,210
typically if you want to do that it's a

428
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,269
good idea

429
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:35,959
to burn the ends so you have a nice

430
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:38,929
gradual radius so you don't have an

431
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:41,149
abrupt transition because any abrupt

432
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:44,719
transition will be very weak so if you

433
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:48,349
look here okay you burned it to avoid an

434
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:53,629
abrupt transition and we went between

435
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:57,158
two pointed electrodes

436
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,360
setting smaller less like the same

437
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,770
setting you would use a bit higher than

438
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,050
you would use if it was just a stainless

439
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:26,140
so you traps apart okay and now it's

440
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,360
it's welded and if you try to pull it

441
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,400
out it's actually very strong I mean

442
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,710
there's some some strange alloy it

443
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,020
formed in between but you don't care

444
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,750
it's all connected so and becomes one

445
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,440
case and it's strong enough you can

446
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,510
again do a test for strength

447
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,490
it's actually the fairy storm you can't

448
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:57,810
rip it out so okay so the last thing we

449
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,030
need to talk about is how to make

450
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,760
electrodes because as you can see a lot

451
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,210
of these jobs require custom electrodes

452
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,890
so you'll have to make yourself a set of

453
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,880
electrodes besides the normal ones which

454
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,570
come with a machine okay so now all the

455
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,460
electrodes are made of copper you just

456
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,140
take a buy yourself a couple bell square

457
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,270
around and just bend it copper is very

458
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,550
easy to paint copper is a beautiful

459
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,160
material because after you bend it it

460
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,960
becomes water walk hound

461
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,300
so if it's hard to bend you can anneal

462
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,430
it soften it Bend it because they become

463
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,890
hard anyway just by bending but it's

464
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,440
easy enough to bend like this now the

465
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,340
tips of the electrodes not made of

466
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,350
copper although you can use copper you

467
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,360
can just leave the metal itself as a tip

468
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,920
the copper itself but this tip will

469
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,190
easily squeeze and wear because copper

470
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,440
is a bit soft so if you want long

471
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,710
lasting tips you have to insert tips and

472
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,260
these are made from either copper

473
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,070
tungsten alloy of copper chrome alloy so

474
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,460
the cheapest is copper core mellory

475
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,280
you buy a word like this you can get it

476
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,950
from mcmaster-carr it's cheap and this

477
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,680
will last you for 100 tips okay and you

478
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,500
just

479
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,850
good way to machine it'll be tape make a

480
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,010
taper hole press it in

481
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:30,679
okay so to makes a taper home you just

482
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,290
take a dollar pin

483
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,260
I grind it tape a freehand it doesn't

484
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,700
have to be accurate just put in the

485
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,740
drill against the sander make it tape

486
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,360
here grind it flat to half the diameter

487
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,340
that's called a debit and that's a

488
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,990
milling cutter basically so that's how

489
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,660
you make yourself a million cutters and

490
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,540
because this is hard enough to cut copy

491
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:57,350
okay and research you deliver the taper

492
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,010
hole and then you machine tape on the

493
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,720
insert and president it doesn't have to

494
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,310
be accurate because the copper will flow

495
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,710
so it was you just squeeze hard it will

496
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,410
make it on shape so that's how you put

497
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,430
the tips in because in many jobs you

498
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,130
have to make strange electrodes and if

499
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,530
you have the copper bar you can make

500
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,250
electrode as you need them for example

501
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,700
sometimes you have to get deep inside

502
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,680
the box or cavity so I need electrode

503
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,520
like this which goes so any kind of

504
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,680
strange reasons you may need special

505
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,770
electrodes this has a short neck so you

506
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,200
this one has extended electrodes which

507
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,180
you probably don't need most welders

508
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,410
have a long neck the longer the neck the

509
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,650
less the current because this into

510
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,080
increases inductance especially we have

511
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,050
a big sheet of ferromagnetic material so

512
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,760
since this was designed to run on

513
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,280
minimum power it has a short neck to

514
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,350
minimize inductance so that's the reason

515
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,750
why it's designed but you can always

516
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:10,970
extend it okay now other specialty

517
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,280
electrodes you basically just make as

518
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,280
you go with some you make some very thin

519
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,800
electrodes to get to get into little

520
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,290
places you make all kinds of offset

521
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,500
electrodes to get around some fold in

522
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,840
the metal so which you just make as you

523
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,379
need them

524
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:33,100
lectroids to weld blades together like a

525
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,420
band saw blade that's a very much as a

526
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,750
welder which comes with a bandsaw doing

527
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,550
the bandsaw blade like electrodes to

528
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,360
weld sinks at the precise angle so this

529
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,550
is just a piece of copper scrap copper

530
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,920
cut the precise angle so when you weld a

531
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,830
lord say start to a piece it will come

532
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,140
out exactly the right angle

533
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,909
obviously that's if you need a whole

534
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:02,710
bunch of stars all pointing the right

535
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,649
way just make it one electrode so both

536
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:07,210
of you just make some and solve them

537
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,730
away if you don't need them or recycle

538
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,620
them and there's many many little

539
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,990
special electrodes like to hold a little

540
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:21,159
part okay okay now in general you don't

541
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,330
have to if you have a party well - and

542
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,340
you don't want to mark it except for the

543
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,010
world you just need to give it a much

544
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,710
bigger contact area than the other tip

545
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,289
so if you will the three millimeter

546
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:37,240
square let's say oh ten millimeter

547
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,940
square if the contact area here is 70

548
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,919
millimeter square this part will not get

549
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,440
hot already so if I wanted to win the

550
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,289
stud here without any marking all that I

551
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:50,049
need is like a V okay the moment this

552
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:53,879
area is much bigger it will not heat up

553
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:59,350
so I think we covered everything you

554
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,889
need to know about spot welding besides

555
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,720
the goggles and the shoes it's

556
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,299
completely safe because this is only two

557
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:12,220
in our folds so as I said if I hold my

558
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,889
hands on the electrodes when it works

559
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:18,820
I feel nothing but there are five

560
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,440
thousand amps flowing here

561
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,019
so you have to be aware of it because if

562
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:26,929
you are holding some magnetic objects or

563
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:28,610
metallic objects that will be attracted

564
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,399
the 5000 ohms is a significant magnetic

565
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:32,889
force

566
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:35,750
okay another useful thing you can do the

567
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,850
spot well there is built watertight

568
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,090
enclosures and the way you do that you

569
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,139
spread a very thin bead of silicone RTV

570
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:50,880
silicone just very very thin like this

571
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,170
okay and then you will sue it but the

572
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,880
pressure of the well will displace a

573
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,920
silicon and you will sue it on quite a

574
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,690
dense peach say you set it up on fall

575
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:10,260
and it'll smoke a bit okay but it

576
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,220
doesn't matter see the carbon tells you

577
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,780
that it's in welded although I didn't

578
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,410
see any spark

579
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:24,660
okay so and so when you do this what it

580
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,300
does it displaces RTV you can see it

581
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,370
coming out and it makes a completely

582
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,860
watertight weld so if you have to build

583
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,380
a gas tank of something like that that

584
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,320
is this way to do it okay one other

585
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,530
thing the spot welder is good for is to

586
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,650
salvage little pieces of material to put

587
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,200
in the water jet because of the clamping

588
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,900
area of the water jet you can't cut all

589
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,030
the way to the edge so if you have a

590
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,740
piece of material and you want to use

591
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,800
all of it and you and you can't cut all

592
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,570
the way to the edge you want to attach a

593
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,750
little piece so you can hold it so the

594
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,280
way you do it you can either if the

595
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,960
materials are very thin you can just put

596
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,490
one on top of the other spot weight

597
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,250
because it's crap anyway but sometimes

598
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,870
you materials is sick and you don't want

599
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,990
to step so what you do is you back them

600
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,880
like this

601
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,660
but some flush and you put a weld on the

602
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,520
joint and it will weld them horizontally

603
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,550
we just melt them together what you do

604
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,720
is you go like this

605
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:38,179
so what you do is you put a whale just

606
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:39,650
on the flash it's not a very strong

607
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,960
whale because it melts it horizontally

608
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,510
instead of vertically but it's it

609
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,400
doesn't have a step it smoothes and

610
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,720
that's all that you need to grip it in

611
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,289
the water jet
