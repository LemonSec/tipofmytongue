1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,760
okay so I'm just preparing two adhesive

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,250
bonded joints today

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,830
trade something for the next session

4
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:25,520
never mix the caps of course now

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,730
so one of them will be a peel strength

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,760
test joint and one of me will be a pure

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,239
shear test joint if you have fast epoxy

8
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,309
like this a five-minute epoxy and for

9
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:42,640
some reason you need longer working time

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,920
just mix it on a chilled piece of metal

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,019
piece of aluminum because if it's cold

12
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:51,460
the working time is much longer okay

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,769
okay so now just prepare one area and

14
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:59,870
the good thing actually put some epoxy

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:09,080
on both sides this put it together put a

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,080
weight on it and make it set to the same

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,990
heel now because there's a small taper

18
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,869
of the water jet you can always assemble

19
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:25,369
it from the direction the hole is

20
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:30,590
slightly bigger when you put the epoxy

21
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,619
on all surfaces now it says five minute

22
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,719
epoxy but it really to get any

23
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,939
reasonable strength you have to wait an

24
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:45,979
hour oh okay good so what is to set and

25
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,280
we are done okay so this is an

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,409
introduction of how to build large

27
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:54,920
structures using the water jet and this

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,789
is in particular structures which are

29
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:00,469
temporary you want to do some experiment

30
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:02,929
you have some temporary setup because if

31
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:05,240
you want to build large structures in a

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,549
permanent way the cheapest and the

33
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:10,610
simplest is steel welding just take some

34
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,390
pipes and plates and you end it all up

35
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,010
but welding has two problems for

36
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,110
students a of researcher the first

37
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,330
problem is it's hard to learn to become

38
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,030
a good welder because it's it's

39
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,350
something which takes a lot of

40
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,459
experimental

41
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:31,160
experience in skilled and the second

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,200
problem welding has even for a good well

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,870
they're that welding causes very large

44
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,540
distortions and everything you will

45
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,640
so if I had to connect two pieces by

46
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,849
weld and I say a world of the corner as

47
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:46,340
the world cools it will pull the parts

48
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,829
and you have to do many many tricks to

49
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,750
minimize the distortion and even then

50
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,959
the part is distorted so then you have

51
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,970
to machine the areas to correct the

52
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,709
distortion so it's a lot of work to

53
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,420
build structures by welding but that's

54
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,860
the only way to do it if you need

55
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,209
strength but if you don't need the

56
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:07,609
strength you just need stiffness and we

57
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:10,220
just saw a demo that most of the times

58
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,040
that's what you want to see a very good

59
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,170
way to be large structures is by

60
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,970
adhesive bonding now a let's say we need

61
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,519
to build a structure which is 1 meter by

62
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,920
2 meters to hold some instruments or

63
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,470
some experiences so what I did that

64
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,980
suggests they did a 110 scale model

65
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,620
because I'm just another not to waste 1

66
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,239
meter of aluminum plates which is

67
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,329
expensive so what so let's imagine this

68
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:41,000
as one tenth of full size and I needed

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,500
some structure to hold some very precise

70
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,989
beam let's say I have a granite we have

71
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:50,540
a granite being here and I want to hold

72
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,230
it very very accurately in space so a

73
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,519
good way to build these structures is by

74
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,590
making some end plates form aluminum

75
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,010
plate and braces from pipes now it's not

76
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,720
the only way you can make the braces

77
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,730
also an aluminum plate and you can make

78
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,359
many variations but the idea is that you

79
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,489
cut all the cut parts on the water jet

80
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:17,260
and you assemble it by adhesive bonding

81
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,889
so a you can here take advantage again

82
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:24,320
of the fact that the water jet cuts with

83
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,740
a very small taper so you can make the

84
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,289
parts they fit in easily from one side

85
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,690
but they don't fit so easily from the

86
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,699
other side because of the taper over

87
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,460
here is only 50 microns but what it

88
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,099
means that you can temporarily assemble

89
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:44,210
the structure just by pressing it in and

90
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,830
you can test everything before you

91
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,569
bonded together and that's very very

92
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:52,319
convenient so say you can assemble the

93
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,270
structure and imagine this is a tenth of

94
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,240
the real size and and test every saying

95
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,699
and modify and then when it's all ready

96
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,919
you knock it down and then you bonded

97
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,490
and then experiment but but even even

98
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,800
when it's permanent the nice thing about

99
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,289
it but months later when the experiment

100
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:15,629
is finished you can heat up the whole

101
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:17,729
structure either with the torch of in an

102
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,280
oven and look at the part because the

103
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,650
same thing I did here without the epoxy

104
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,680
if this was heat adapt about 150 degrees

105
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,819
Celsius

106
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:29,490
okay also say off this again two degrees

107
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,219
F I could actually knock it apart even

108
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:37,229
if those bonded with epoxy now the one

109
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:39,180
thing you when you look at that you say

110
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,780
why not buy these extrusions which come

111
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,210
with T slots and and they are designed

112
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,460
for rapid assembly and disassembly and

113
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,219
they come in all sizes typically two by

114
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,259
two inch cross section of Cerebus range

115
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,300
cross section and the answer is all

116
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,699
these structures are not rigid because

117
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,190
if you take a structure like this and

118
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,229
bolt it together at the corners and so

119
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:04,319
on it the rigidity is way below

120
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,539
structure which is adhesively bonded

121
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:10,110
like this because at the end if you if

122
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,599
if you look at just system with the t

123
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:17,190
slots and the school at the end as a if

124
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,849
you bend it it stretches to school okay

125
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,430
so it has a huge leaver and it stretches

126
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,039
the school and sideways there is nothing

127
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,129
stopping it on twisting so as long as

128
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:31,020
there is a little bit of twist possible

129
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,669
of a little bit of play possible there

130
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:35,789
is no rigidity in the structure so it is

131
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:37,469
okay for sinks which don't need any

132
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:40,110
accuracy like an enclosure a cafe or

133
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,690
something to hold the table but if this

134
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,199
also has to provide the accuracy much as

135
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,840
an enclosure it has to be all rigidly

136
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,300
connected everywhere and it has to be

137
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,690
over constrained heavily and basically

138
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,419
made into one piece so to make it into

139
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,930
one piece

140
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,699
as I said if you don't want to weld it

141
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,139
which you could you could do the same

142
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,240
thing and weld it okay but if you don't

143
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,400
want to weld it one of the best ways is

144
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,910
adhesive joints now why do you do that

145
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,490
you think of all the things you would

146
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,220
need for example you'll need some

147
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,190
bracket he of the whole something else

148
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,039
so you cut out some holes very much like

149
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,470
woodwork and you make a bracket like

150
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,830
this and the bracket would fit into the

151
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,410
holes again you take advantage of the

152
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,840
slight taper okay so you it doesn't it

153
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,820
doesn't fit in one way but it fits in

154
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,099
the other way and and what you do

155
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,030
actually here is I just ground on the

156
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,800
sander I just send it this down a little

157
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,669
bit to give it a minut slope and because

158
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,680
it doesn't my new slope it's actually

159
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,380
looking like a wedge so if I put it in

160
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,570
it without adhesive it will lock into

161
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,610
one piece so if I do that it look to get

162
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,560
there like a wedge and you'll be

163
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,360
surprised how strong this bond is

164
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,639
without any adhesive so if I want to

165
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:14,800
take it out if I want to remove that

166
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,990
piece I would have to hammer pretty hard

167
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:27,849
to get it out okay now of course at the

168
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,679
end you'll put adhesive on it so say if

169
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,049
I have these plates and and I need so

170
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,320
any kind of brackets that I need I would

171
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,049
either air to the plates or if I need

172
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,990
some support in the middle let's say

173
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,079
this is assembly and I needed some

174
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,640
assembly in the middle I would make

175
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,980
other plates which slide on the pipes

176
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,570
and hold things in the middle so you'd

177
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,390
think out the whole thing in 3d think of

178
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,459
any support for it any bracket you need

179
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:04,870
and assemble it all at once now if you

180
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,660
need a reference surface you assemble

181
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,339
the whole thing on top of a granite

182
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:11,920
plate for example if it's very

183
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,439
at this surface in this evidence itself

184
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:15,790
is a cool play now

185
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,009
I wouldn't assemble it like this I would

186
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:19,809
assemble it upside down on the granite

187
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,850
plate and let it cure on the granite

188
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,269
plate and this way when I pick it up

189
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:27,970
everything is automatically play now now

190
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,999
the other thing you do all the parts

191
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:34,359
which are not permanent you can lock in

192
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:38,079
with some flexure clamps so for example

193
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,600
if I look at this assembly and this was

194
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,989
just assembly now let's see which side

195
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:48,730
is which that's a collects ID so that's

196
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,220
just a semi a woman as adhesive now but

197
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,220
you can imagine the ends of sandblasted

198
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,859
the inside of the cut of the waterjet

199
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:59,589
behaves like sandblasted so all I have

200
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,089
to do is just smear adhesive on both

201
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:04,779
sides and assemble it which I wouldn't

202
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:29,589
just do it now and it's amazingly rigid

203
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,189
even without any adhesive now and of

204
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:35,410
course I will assemble all these

205
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,619
brackets that I need the main benefit

206
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:41,049
here is the self registration of what's

207
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,910
called self giggles I don't need any

208
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,009
jigs to assemble it accurately because I

209
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,749
was in locks and slots it's all

210
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:49,600
automatically checked now of course this

211
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,910
has to be made plain now because it can

212
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,100
still twist so if I would assembly

213
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,730
pomegranate plate oh just toss it in

214
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,339
play now now which play now to check it

215
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:06,220
on the granite plate okay now if I want

216
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,369
to hold removable parts let's say I want

217
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,249
to hold this granite beam I would use

218
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:15,189
remember so one tenth of actual size is

219
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:17,619
actually huge structure I would use

220
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:19,660
flexure clamps and the way you make a

221
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,139
flexure clamp you cut a slot and and you

222
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:25,400
put in something which can expand and

223
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,200
this is a clamp so the easiest way to

224
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,580
expand is you tap it to the taper thread

225
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,279
take a pipe thread that's you know old

226
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,390
pipe Smith

227
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:41,029
tapered so you know you use a regular

228
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:46,010
plug which is used on plumbing and they

229
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,529
come in all sizes from 1/8 soften the

230
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:52,390
16th of an inch pipe size to huge plugs

231
00:11:52,390 --> 00:12:00,279
okay you tap the hole with a pipe thread

232
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,220
okay and then you just want us all ready

233
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,820
tapped when you put in the plug it will

234
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,400
expand and claim and that works very

235
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,160
very well for example if I slide in a

236
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:24,050
granite beam all is quite accurate here

237
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,290
of a granite beam which is very nice fit

238
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,870
perfectly fits in but I can slide it ok

239
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,529
the moment the moment I tell you this

240
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:39,980
plug okay it's locked in can't move it

241
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,620
and I can disassemble it and it's a very

242
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,200
very good clamping system because it

243
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,360
doesn't put local load it spreads the

244
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,050
load say they inexperienced person you

245
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,540
put a set school in and that's a very

246
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,000
bad idea because the sets code cracks a

247
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,770
granite because it put all the load at

248
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,200
one point okay and in any case it's not

249
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,810
accurate even if it wasn't brittle it's

250
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,250
not accurate because the set screw

251
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,900
deforms it it puts all the pressure on

252
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,540
point but if you put this flexure clamp

253
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,450
it just expands in the gradual very

254
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,490
gentle arc and spread the pressure on

255
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,070
the whole granite so any kind of flexure

256
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,839
clamps are much much superior to set

257
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,420
schools even if you have a pulley and

258
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,670
you want to clamp a pulley or even to

259
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,350
club anything you water jet cutter

260
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,660
flexure clamp into it rather than a set

261
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,850
screw okay now the next thing we wanted

262
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,270
and state take it apart you get a huge

263
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,040
leave energy of course because that's

264
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,470
where the ingress

265
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,930
two degrees so you get the leverage of

266
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,270
the thread you get running either plus

267
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,490
the leverage of the wedge so you can

268
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,500
make generate many many tons of force

269
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,240
just by want em and once you loosen it

270
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,650
completely okay so I want to explain

271
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,220
something about adhesive joints the

272
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,860
proper adhesive joints should always be

273
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,390
designed to work in shear mode right

274
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,900
like this should next best saying is

275
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,990
designed in tension which is much we

276
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,080
care and never be designed to work in

277
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,010
peel mode and to demonstrate this with

278
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,780
let's look at the samples we prepared

279
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,770
earlier these are the two samples we

280
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,930
prepared earlier with five-minute epoxy

281
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,980
a one is for peel mode and one is for

282
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,060
pure shear mode so this was sent blasted

283
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,850
properly done properly cured by all the

284
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,530
holes and if I do it in peel mode a zero

285
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,230
strength which is surprising the epoxy

286
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,480
was spread that everything was good at a

287
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,760
zero strength and if you try it with any

288
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,530
other adhesive you get the same results

289
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,800
so never design something sometimes you

290
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,210
don't think you're designing in the

291
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,340
field mode but it actually peel mode for

292
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:06,570
example if you make a bracket let's say

293
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,200
if you glue a bracket like this you

294
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,240
don't think if the joint is loaded in

295
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,090
peel mode because you think it's tension

296
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,610
but it's not because if you bend it if

297
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,410
you try to bend this bracket it'll peel

298
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,830
off on one end so any somewhat many

299
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,570
joints that you don't think will be

300
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,450
failing in peel mode I've actually will

301
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,270
fail in P mode that you know even things

302
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,140
like this okay you say well that's in

303
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,240
shear mode but not because it lifts up

304
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,820
and it's in peel mode okay so basically

305
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
any design like this will fail instantly

306
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,780
okay

307
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,080
so so if you compare this area of

308
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,240
adhesive itself it's actually more

309
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,030
worried of

310
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,690
and I feel and let's let's go do a test

311
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,870
and see the strength of this and you'll

312
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,850
see this is much stronger in one second

313
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,770
but but I want you to think of the

314
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,100
explanation why Sepideh mode so hopeless

315
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,830
and the shield modes are good and the

316
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,350
answer is it's a shield mode puts the

317
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,740
load at once on the whole joint because

318
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,450
energy wants to move so the load is

319
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,420
instantly applied to the whole area new

320
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,110
mode puts all the load on one line

321
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,690
because just a line where it starts

322
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,270
lifting off anything behind it doesn't

323
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,910
see the load so since all the load is

324
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,850
concentrated to one line which means

325
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,660
geometrically zero area it has to fail

326
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,160
okay that's why they should be very very

327
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,720
careful the same thing is true for soul

328
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,360
living if this was sold if not done with

329
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,010
the proxy I could still rip it apart by

330
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,400
hand okay so let's just test the

331
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,850
strengths of this for comparison okay so

332
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,010
now we're going to test the properly

333
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,560
designed joint which is a shear joint

334
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,840
this measures the pressure in tonnes

335
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,060
from 0 to 30 tons okay let me take very

336
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,680
long actually I only took like two tons

337
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,220
but still two tons compared to zero it's

338
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:16,250
not bad okay it broke the joint the two

339
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,300
tonnes if this is strictly proportional

340
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,180
to area so if this was this is 1/10

341
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,310
scale if this was full size would have

342
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,820
been 20 tons because it actually would

343
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,000
have been 10 time would be no 100 times

344
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,440
speaker because area would be a hundred

345
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,390
times bigger so it's this was ten times

346
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,580
scale the area would be hundred times

347
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,520
bigger would be 200 times okay which is

348
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,380
very respectable okay so he just took a

349
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,930
quick note about the his Eve's

350
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,320
there are only about four types of

351
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,720
different adhesives you need in a lab

352
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,350
and the most commonly used is epoxy like

353
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,990
five-minute epoxy because as it name

354
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,870
says you don't have to wait too long

355
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,170
now second adhesive which is very very

356
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,390
useful is a silicone RTV and the

357
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,000
uniqueness of RTV is first it's only and

358
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,470
easy which can take a high temperature

359
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,370
among common adhesives the clear our tvs

360
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,770
a regular one can easily take 250

361
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,380
degrees see the red one you can buy the

362
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,090
same thing with a different cure system

363
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,880
which is red it's ion q it can take

364
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,040
about 300 degrees C or maybe a bit more

365
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,760
so it's very good to anything which gets

366
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,930
hot heaters and so on a RTV is another

367
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,780
very interesting property to first it

368
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,560
stays elastic forever and B it makes a

369
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,020
tenacious bond to glass and certain

370
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,780
ceramics without even sandblasting or

371
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,060
anything because all other adhesives as

372
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,540
I explained under paintings cannot

373
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,790
really be used well if the surface is

374
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,520
not prepared at least by gluing but

375
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,070
preferably by sandblasting so it's the

376
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,900
same as paint preparation either your

377
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,600
Hobbit with bathroom cleaner like comet

378
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,820
or Ajax oh you blew it or you send blast

379
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,580
but preferably a sandblast yeah our TVs

380
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,710
only adhesive which doesn't need that

381
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,870
for certain materials because it forms a

382
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,810
tenacious chemical bond

383
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,280
especially to glass you can see in

384
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,190
aquariums where the edge glue aquariums

385
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,250
now for glass plates with our TV that's

386
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:34,610
good now so we have a poxy RTV a very

387
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,160
very useful adhesive is polyurethane

388
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,490
well you're saying that he Civ has some

389
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,580
unique properties the first property it

390
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,270
is a bit flexible and bonds tenaciously

391
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,020
to things like rub there and flexible

392
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,540
materials none of the other adhesives

393
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,450
bond well to slightly flexible materials

394
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,730
because they adhesives are rigid and

395
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,400
somehow they don't hold poly you are

396
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,380
saying certain types are also designed

397
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,930
to foam up by themselves and fill all

398
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,100
the gaps like this is say this is it

399
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,380
just says on it Gorilla Glue but it's

400
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,830
basically a high-quality polyurethane

401
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,700
and he

402
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,080
if it is excellent for bonding sheets

403
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,900
together there has good peel strengths

404
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,490
it's it's actually a much much better

405
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,980
and easier than epoxy but here's the cue

406
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,980
overnight and the last adhesive which is

407
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,530
useful it's just some spray contact

408
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,870
cement if you want to cover something

409
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,210
with a large sheet with a uniform usin

410
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,070
adhesive you just spray of course

411
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,630
contact cement you have to spray both

412
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,750
sides there's other adhesives enough to

413
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,160
apply to one side so if I do that peel

414
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,830
test I've done before by gluing together

415
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,310
two strips and trying to peel them apart

416
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,140
you've seen before that the epoxy had

417
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,280
zero strengths basically the one reason

418
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,560
epoxy will have zero strengths in peel

419
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,350
because when you pee here you all the

420
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,960
stress is concentrated in one line or it

421
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,090
wants to separate so so theoretically

422
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,270
the stress if the adhesives is rigid the

423
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,100
stress is nearly infinite because it's

424
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,620
all one line it'll break if you did the

425
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,260
same test with a semi flexible adhesive

426
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,030
like poly you're saying especially

427
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,430
without TV the peel strengths would be

428
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,040
better because it was stretched that

429
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,110
he's able to stretch and the material

430
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,630
behind the line would also stretch so

431
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,490
the stress will be distributed of a

432
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,190
bigger area so anything which has to

433
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,320
flex and Bend and may end up in peel

434
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,190
mode you cannot use epoxy but you can

435
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,320
use our t v-- or polyurethane i

436
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,840
preferably don't design joints to

437
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,550
operate in this mode but when you have

438
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,640
you can't use epoxy at all so this is

439
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,050
basically all what you need to know

440
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,510
about adhesives unless you get into

441
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,770
really exotic stuff

442
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,960
there's also another family of acrylic

443
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,480
adhesives which is a little bit in

444
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,000
between these two in properties but you

445
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
usually really in a normal lab

446
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,370
environment what you see here is all

447
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,590
that he's if you need

448
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,830
now another adhesive which is commonly

449
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,960
used and I don't have here is a

450
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,190
cyanoacrylates which what's known as

451
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,130
super glue so magical or super glue now

452
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,010
they are not very good adhesive for two

453
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,940
reasons

454
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,620
a they are very rigid so the the joint

455
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,690
can fall off from a shock can break

456
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,970
under a shock load very quickly they are

457
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,710
very good for a bear because they bond

458
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,720
instantly so they're good for all things

459
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,000
but they have another problem which is

460
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,810
very very devious that they emit some

461
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:52,100
gas slowly so if you glue anything with

462
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,890
superglue and there is any optics in the

463
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,230
same books the optics will fog up within

464
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,290
a few weeks and be ruined so you saw and

465
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,360
also they have some bad effect on some

466
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,640
plastics they called cause the plastics

467
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,040
to craze craze meaning develop micro

468
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,480
cracks so there is some side effects of

469
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,370
super glues that you don't see when you

470
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,050
glue it but when you come back a month

471
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,300
later you find out all kinds of plastic

472
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,520
pieces are correct and they all any

473
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,770
optical part is covered by a white film

474
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,680
so it's basically for better to be

475
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,050
avoided for for scientific work because

476
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,720
other adhesives don't outguess much and

477
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,850
you can bake them you can bake them and

478
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,930
stop the outgassing

479
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,360
to a great degree because anything which

480
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,280
is in a sealed box you're always worried

481
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,620
about outgassing from adhesives that's

482
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,630
why when you build laser for other

483
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,460
things you are not allowed to use any of

484
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,870
those because those are ongoing

485
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,490
outgassing but at least you can

486
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,010
accelerate the outgassing but baking but

487
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,600
some of those have a lot of bad

488
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,150
outgassing and kind of strange materials

489
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,550
come out of them so unless you really

490
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,610
need them well not recommended adhesives

491
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,670
for normal scientific work okay one

492
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,860
other thing you have to be careful about

493
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,830
because of the high expansion

494
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,300
coefficients of plastics and of all

495
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,400
adhesives which are basically polymers

496
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,700
is when you need things to stay precise

497
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,250
with temperature so I already mentioned

498
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,290
that the temperature expansion of all

499
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,330
the polymers of an old of magnitude

500
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,580
roughly molten metals unless they are

501
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,390
heavily filled so when you would burned

502
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,750
a meal say with epoxy of RTV into a

503
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,910
piece of metal so you have to worry

504
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,160
about two things first the glass and the

505
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,750
metal have different expansion

506
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,760
coefficients so you have to make sure

507
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,890
over the size of the mirror you wouldn't

508
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,990
be a problem but you have to think of

509
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,570
something else

510
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,690
to that bonding layer will expand with

511
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,419
temperature 10 times faster than the

512
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,570
metal so if this mirror is just acting

513
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,789
as a head-on mirror our 45 degree mirror

514
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:56,309
the problem is not very big because if

515
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:58,950
this mirror will shift parallel it

516
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,360
usually it's not a problem

517
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,480
let's say you have a 50 micron bond

518
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,659
layer even if he changes 10% in sickness

519
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,360
it's only 5 microns or 5 micron parallel

520
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,279
shift is usually not a problem for the

521
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,940
length of a mirror but if you burned it

522
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,179
and you feel they're adhesive as a wedge

523
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:19,529
let's say you want to align it and you

524
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:21,509
align it and then you put epoxy behind

525
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:25,289
it which forms a wedge Zion the angle of

526
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:26,549
the mirror will change its temperature

527
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:29,340
and you have a big multiplier effect

528
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,100
because of the optical level and it's -

529
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,960
not just for a mirror it's true for any

530
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,059
structure you burned if you burnt the

531
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,039
right angle bracket as long as it's

532
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,049
parallel it'll move up and down a bit a

533
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:43,259
few microns but if it's a bracket which

534
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:45,990
is bonded with a wedge it will tilt and

535
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,049
there will be multiplied by the links so

536
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:52,580
that's something to keep in mind
