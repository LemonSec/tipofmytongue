1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,920
okay so now we are going to try vacuum

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,590
forming you can do it by putting a

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,590
plastic or you can heat the plastic in

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,960
an oven and quickly move it over we are

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,580
trying to do it with lexan which is

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,260
actually very difficult material for

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,970
vacant forming because it doesn't soften

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,419
easily but that's all I have on hand so

9
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,940
RapidArc

10
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,760
as I said lexan doesn't really soften

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,350
and as soon as it cools down a little

12
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,200
bit it becomes hard so it wouldn't pull

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,030
down all the way but any other plastic

14
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,750
like PVC a BAS polyethylene the old form

15
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,670
beautiful is all pull down all the way

16
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,330
so for the Vulcan forming all that you

17
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,710
need is a little bit hot but for the

18
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,110
very conforming or what you need it

19
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,970
looks terrible but anyway shows the

20
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,330
principle so you need a bottom mode okay

21
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,920
and the vacuum will actually spread

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,930
around so you don't need to make roofs

23
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,340
or anything so they can spread around

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,000
the corners you need a top frame to

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,390
clamp the plastic okay otherwise you can

26
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,369
just pull in the ends will pull in it

27
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:56,000
wouldn't and then you need a heated

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,210
sheet of plastic and that's it it takes

29
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,430
one second let it cool down the

30
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,369
advantage of lexan of course it's strong

31
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:07,190
shatterproof so and you have to leave it

32
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,929
for normal plastics you have to leave it

33
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,580
completely to cool down because you know

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,680
it still can distort if you take it off

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,600
the mold the lexan how it's very hot

36
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,910
still but it's already hard but normal

37
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,130
plastic stays soft a long time so it

38
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,720
will form beautifully but you have to

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,890
leave it to cool down

40
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,569
okay another

41
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,959
which is sometimes useful is replication

42
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,709
of parts in plastic now today a lot of

43
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:35,139
the plastic parts of special shape can

44
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:37,599
be made by desktop printers by 3d

45
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,480
printers 3d printers but sometimes you

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,639
still need a part with a very good

47
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,790
finish always very good properties of

48
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,579
plastic like a filled plastic which

49
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:52,480
cannot be used in a 3d printers so the

50
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,060
way you make it is you make a mold of

51
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,849
silicone rubber and then you pull any

52
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,189
plastic you want including some molten

53
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:03,219
metal too if you want another mold so

54
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:06,159
let's say we have this knob just as an

55
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,949
example and we want to make a copy of it

56
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:13,299
so what we do is we put the knob in a

57
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,699
little box and cover it with silicone

58
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:19,030
rubber this is not the silicone rubber

59
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,489
adhesive I showed you in the caulking

60
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,699
gun this is silicone rubber mold making

61
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,919
material which actually it doesn't stick

62
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,989
to anything that's its uniqueness it has

63
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,609
a stick to anything so you don't have to

64
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,349
put any kind of mold release or anything

65
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:34,629
so you just put it at the bottom of a

66
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,229
little cup mix the two components mold

67
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:41,759
making silicone rubber and over it and

68
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,680
cure it and when you get a part like

69
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,489
this so basically this came out from

70
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,870
this okay this is how it came out from

71
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,400
the mold and he pulled out because it's

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,739
so flexible under the cuts are okay for

73
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,019
example you can see two pins sticking

74
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,209
inside and these two pins are actually

75
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:07,209
the two holes or the set scores so it's

76
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,609
no problem at all to mold it including

77
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:11,319
the holes because it'll pull out and

78
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,199
release themselves so you can even see

79
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,810
there this has Alan Schools

80
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,509
you can even see the hex inside the

81
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,880
school copied here but really the

82
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,969
ability of this process to copy goes

83
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,880
down to a molecular level like if you

84
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,550
trace the surface here with a probe with

85
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,099
molecular resolution and you trace the

86
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:35,169
surface of the copy they follow within

87
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:36,620
molecular resolution

88
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,930
the reason I know that for sure because

89
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,440
think of replication of records like a

90
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,380
normal LP record of the old days

91
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,200
had they something like a 50 micron gold

92
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,830
EPS but near a hundred DB dynamic range

93
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,970
which means that the modulation was at

94
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,790
the nanometer level at the bottom for

95
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,240
100 DB below 50 micron so anyway so it's

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,450
a perfect process it is not so good

97
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,830
dimensionally because this can distort

98
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,870
it's flexible so if you want to

99
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,910
dimensionally more accurate you have to

100
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,370
put some metal screen inside before you

101
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,080
pull the rubber to just make it a bit

102
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,300
stronger but it's very very good for

103
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,080
surface texture and every little detail

104
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,480
now one other things when you mix

105
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,490
viscous materials like some epoxies or

106
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,170
silicon there's a lot of air bubbles

107
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,360
trapped in it so what you have to do you

108
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,210
have to mix it pair instructions put it

109
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,180
in a vacuum chamber like this and the

110
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,790
gas it the guess it means you start up

111
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,750
the vacuum say and you leave it up for

112
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,760
half an hour until all air bubbles

113
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,310
exploded and and you have to put a

114
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,020
country you put in a container much

115
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,970
taller than this is because you'll form

116
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,330
up please see four times taller so let's

117
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,060
say ID guess that I bear put this in a

118
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,240
plate pull the rubber overweight heated

119
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,880
it up awaited today took it out and now

120
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,000
have a mold so now I want to cast a copy

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,910
of this so the best way to cast a very

122
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,190
high-quality copy without air bubbles or

123
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,630
defects is casted in vacuum again by

124
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,240
sucking in the epoxy so the way you do

125
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,860
it you put the mold here inside put the

126
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,150
mold inside the vacuum chamber you mix

127
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,510
up the resin you want to cast is a

128
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,120
polyester or epoxy or polyurethane or

129
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,120
any typically any component to component

130
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,790
residues to polymerize if you want the

131
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,650
best result you have to do guess this

132
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,290
first as well so you only put in less

133
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,590
than a third of the height put it in the

134
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,450
vacuum chamber and first

135
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,499
first you have to dig ass resin itself

136
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:57,489
shall be no trapped air bubbler

137
00:06:57,489 --> 00:07:00,079
so you put it under vacuum you can see

138
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,369
the vacuum going up

139
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:03,889
you wait for full vacuum bubbles will

140
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,239
start forming okay so you leave it there

141
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:10,579
for half an hour until the bubbles

142
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,939
collapsed take it out now you have the

143
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:16,189
guest resin and the same thing as you

144
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:17,629
did before would be guest silicone

145
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:23,409
rubber now you put a feet.you bin and

146
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:28,009
rather plug one end of the fee tube goes

147
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:31,279
in the resin I don't know if you can see

148
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,689
it here this is a resin with a fee tube

149
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:39,289
okay at the end of the feet u'b goes

150
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:41,709
into the mold now it's a good idea

151
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:46,339
because sometimes you can overflow or

152
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,349
suck in a bit too much it's a good idea

153
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:50,689
to put this a guard around the mold so

154
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,369
if it overflows it doesn't mess up the

155
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:56,860
oven just put in a guard like this

156
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,269
put the other end of the tube in the

157
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,369
mold and now we can be a bit higher

158
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:05,860
because of the SAG out there like this

159
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,509
okay now as you start a vacuum there it

160
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:16,299
will suck out the material fill the mold

161
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,979
you do that okay the mold is already

162
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:20,569
full you can see it sucked out the

163
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:23,090
liquid from here okay now you pinch off

164
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,000
the tube because you don't want any more

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,690
resin inside now you release a vacuum I

166
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,460
can see some bubbling zero and you'll

167
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:38,059
release a vacuum okay okay here I'll

168
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,099
spread out now once you release a vacuum

169
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:45,649
two good things happen okay if even if

170
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,959
the material is the gas there is some

171
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,570
miniature air bubbles were introduced by

172
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,910
sucking it in and putting it in now

173
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,740
these air bubbles may have been trapped

174
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,620
still inside but once you release a

175
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,110
vacuum these bubbles collapse because

176
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,959
it's vacancies bubbles inside have very

177
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,339
little air because it was done all

178
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:07,070
undone on the vacuum so even if the real

179
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,779
bubbles it would used and what you saw

180
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,670
the end the foam which was formed is

181
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,370
real collapse and disappear so now what

182
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,670
you do is you can take out the feed tube

183
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,610
turn on the heater and depending on the

184
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,980
resin you use you cure it anywhere from

185
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,230
50 degrees to 80 degrees if it was

186
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,630
silicone poured in I was cured at 100

187
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,029
degrees but some of in this range it'll

188
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:31,370
cure the now well that'll be cured so

189
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,240
silicon take a bit longer now once you

190
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,980
take it out once you take it out and of

191
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,800
course you can dye the resin to have any

192
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,649
color you want so in this case I added

193
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,130
black pigment to the resin so I made a

194
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,270
replica of this knob the surface finish

195
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,700
on the replica is the gloss isn't as

196
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,430
high as the original but a lot of it has

197
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,140
to do with this resin because it was

198
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,440
coldly mixed and filled just just show

199
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,860
the principle okay so this is a simple

200
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,230
process of a replication you can also

201
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,630
make two powered molds if there were

202
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,600
features on the back of this that I also

203
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,420
wanted to copy what I would do I would

204
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,370
pour another layer of silicone to make

205
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,020
the second part of the mold and I would

206
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,779
put in some registration pins so when I

207
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,120
pull it apart I have two halves of a

208
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,160
mold when pins to align them so I can

209
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,360
put it in a

210
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,149
put a feed hole in an air escape hole of

211
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,610
an air inlet hole and I would fill the

212
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,439
hole mold which would being closed and

213
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,619
open it up take out the part now this

214
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:42,259
process walks from tiny parts to huge

215
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,329
parts but of course gets expensive

216
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,790
because the material is expensive you

217
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,079
can if you have you can put metal

218
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,149
inserts in the mold if you want threads

219
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,970
you can put filler in the mold the

220
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,369
carbon fiber you can mix the failure if

221
00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:57,499
it's chopped finely into the resin or

222
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:59,449
you can lay carbon fiber inside the mold

223
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:01,850
and impregnate it this way this is also

224
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,559
the process you impregnate the

225
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,299
electrical coils or other things which

226
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,089
have to be waterproof and very durable

227
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:09,439
because usually air will be trapped

228
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,540
everywhere so the only way to impregnate

229
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,850
something with resin is for a vacuum

230
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,179
process like this now a very interesting

231
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:20,360
property of silicon that short term it

232
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,970
can take very high temperature so if you

233
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,069
made this mold especially if you made it

234
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:26,569
from a red silicone which is higher

235
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:30,259
temperature you can easily melt zinc

236
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,449
alloy parts and pull the molten metal

237
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:35,089
into that you can some even some

238
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:38,419
aluminum alloys can be poured into it

239
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:40,850
once or twice but it wins the mold if

240
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,410
you use it for plastic you can make

241
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,360
hundreds of parts with one mold if you

242
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,009
use it for metal maybe you can make ten

243
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,949
parts but there is a common zinc

244
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:51,889
aluminum alloy used for die casting and

245
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:54,019
you can cast parts in the silicone from

246
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,639
the cellar and they look perfect just

247
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,629
like a bike as part
