1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,320
working with materials which are

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,980
like plastics ceramics and so on so the

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,619
most useful engineering plastic in

4
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:21,130
normal R&D work is poly carbonate which

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,320
is mainly known as under the trade name

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,160
like son G trade name exam so poly

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,789
carbonates are amazing materials because

8
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,230
very

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,900
shatterproof and ductile so you can take

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,559
this is 3/16 poly carbonate you can bend

11
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,420
it as if it was sheet metal and it

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,820
doesn't break and that's a beautiful

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,100
property the spring back a little bit

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,809
this was supposed to be a 90 degree

15
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:51,550
break so it springs back a little bit

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,710
but it's not a problem because you can

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,660
bend it sharper the 90 it was spring

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,100
back to 90 the only disadvantage of this

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,170
in terms of building stuff out of it

20
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,390
that it wouldn't hold threads because

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,610
it's too weak to hold a thread and what

22
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,110
you have to do is to use either inserts

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,050
these are threaded inserts that are set

24
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,500
like pop rivets or we use helicoid if

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,180
you don't have room for the inserts you

26
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,740
can use helicoid see the codes are

27
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,509
little metal springs which follow

28
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:25,210
misread you shred them in and they stay

29
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,610
in place so you can see here this is a

30
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,400
plain hole and these three have Healy

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,759
coils and then the helical imagine

32
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,240
excellent thread so once you do that the

33
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,250
rest of the part is very usable like

34
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,970
metal but a few precautions first of all

35
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,880
these materials are all unstable they

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,040
absorb all plastics and unstable

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,680
materials unless are heavily filled with

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,619
some filler like fibers or so on because

39
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:56,200
all these materials absorb humidity they

40
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,479
change with humidity the soften with

41
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,689
temperature and they also have a much

42
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:04,869
larger thermal expansion coefficient

43
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:07,930
than metals so typically as we said

44
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,610
metals like have an expansion

45
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,620
coefficient between ten and twenty three

46
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,350
say steel is about eleven aluminous for

47
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,540
twenty-three brass is some of in between

48
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,090
steel and aluminum plastics have a

49
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,130
temperature coefficient typically

50
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,549
between 50 and 150 so almost an order of

51
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:25,120
magnitude

52
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,580
the metals and it could be problematic

53
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,190
so if you bow down the plastic sheet to

54
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,099
a metal sheet at the corners you put in

55
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,440
the Sun it will buckle the plastic will

56
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,379
expand and buckle because a hundred ppm

57
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:42,310
is a big problem 100 ppm over a meter is

58
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,440
point one millimetre per degree ten

59
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,209
degrees is one millimeter it's a huge

60
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,400
expansion so it's a big concern of

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,909
expansion is a big problem stability is

62
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:54,970
a big problem so it can't really if you

63
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,400
can avoid using them it's better but

64
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,260
sometimes you need the heat insulation

65
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,840
electrical installation transparency

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,209
then you use them but think of it if

67
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,430
this was a big sheet it's better to

68
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,829
mount one side with a fixed score the

69
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:10,810
other side with a slot and some washer

70
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,109
so it can expand okay so let's talk for

71
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:16,390
couple minutes about ceramic materials

72
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,299
because a lot of times you need to use a

73
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,849
ceramic material either because you need

74
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:24,069
a very high temperature resistant

75
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:26,859
material or because you need a material

76
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:28,239
which is a very good electrical

77
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,790
insulator and high temperature otherwise

78
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,040
you could use plastic for example you

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,829
have to make heater of crucibles so you

80
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,650
have to use ceramics so there's a few

81
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,609
choices here like the a very good choice

82
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:45,700
is materials called machinable ceramics

83
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,500
these are ceramics which can take a

84
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,209
variety Burchell but they're actually

85
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,760
quite machinable is comparable to

86
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,269
aluminum for example this is a material

87
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,690
known as Michael X which is a glass mica

88
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,989
composite and it will take up to about a

89
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:05,319
thousand degrees you can file a you

90
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,879
can finally just like metal say if I can

91
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,069
file a notch in it and if you can see it

92
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:16,478
here but it just has about the

93
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,488
machinability of aluminum in terms of

94
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:20,320
how fast you can do a little file it

95
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,680
it's a very nice material it keeps a

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,240
very good finish it's a very stable

97
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,150
material the only problem is that it's

98
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,830
becoming more and more rare and they are

99
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,750
all expensive because nobody knows about

100
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,169
it

101
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,150
so nobody or don't see it so it's being

102
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,280
phased out the market which is very sad

103
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,120
because it was one of the best

104
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,940
machinable ceramics is being replaced by

105
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,130
much more expensive machinable ceramics

106
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,010
which are no better like michael and so

107
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,080
on which are similar to that but our

108
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,910
brand names and this used to be a dirt

109
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,940
cheap popular material okay you can even

110
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,290
make it yourself it's a separate

111
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,360
material to make but you can get

112
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,060
machinable alumina today quite readily

113
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,639
and the same machinable alumina can be

114
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,040
fired to become very hard but you can

115
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,780
still use it without firing and the

116
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,100
machine will stay it looks a bit like

117
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,760
this another very interesting machinable

118
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,380
material is a bore nitrite in in the

119
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,169
hexagonal form okay so this is some

120
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:20,300
people refer to it is white graphite

121
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,030
this is very much like graphite has

122
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,320
fantastic lubricity properties it's self

123
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,840
lubricating it feels as if it was oiled

124
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,970
so it's very good to make bearing

125
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,970
sliding surface but it can take a very

126
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,610
very high temperature III don't remember

127
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,250
offhand but it'll take at least 1500

128
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,010
degrees maybe even higher and it has a

129
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,590
low temperature expansion very very

130
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,470
easily machinable and not that expensive

131
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,600
it's a great material overall it's just

132
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,940
not that strong it's not it's not hard

133
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,070
of course because machinable and it's

134
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,720
not strong but if you don't need the

135
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,580
strength it's one of the best materials

136
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,500
so for example I'll file a notch image

137
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,760
so you can see it took about as fast or

138
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,410
in faster than this and completely inert

139
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,349
completely slippery the beautiful finish

140
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:17,510
as I said it feels like it's always

141
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,930
oiled so boron nitride white white board

142
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,680
nitrate you can of course buy hardened

143
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,169
alumina parts like pipes and plates and

144
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,200
rods this one you cannot file at all

145
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,080
just go in the file the black mark you

146
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,229
see is alumina actually filed the file

147
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,849
not the other way that's how it went

148
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:40,510
black okay as much harder than the fight

149
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,430
very hard very brittle very strong

150
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,289
aluminized so one of the stronger

151
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:49,159
ceramics so if you can find something

152
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,409
which is the size you need like a pipe

153
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,129
over or

154
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,839
you can just buy that that's very simple

155
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,119
inexpensive you can cut it with diamond

156
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:58,399
tooling you can grind it cut it but it

157
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,830
has to be diamond to link okay

158
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,849
a poor man ceramic that is quite

159
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:07,729
versatile and very cheap is slate slate

160
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,619
is what people used to make roofs off

161
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:12,529
and still people make some counters form

162
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:15,169
and so on so in every town in every

163
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,959
stone shop you can buy slate and this

164
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,349
comb is polished panels anywhere from 1

165
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:23,809
foot by 1 foot to big panels so they're

166
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:26,959
cheap like a 1 foot by 1 foot polished

167
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,729
slate panel is under 10 bucks

168
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:32,779
it's machinable very much like like

169
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:36,169
suborn I tried all my collegues for

170
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:43,219
example if I try to cut here a slot see

171
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:45,050
the slot here it's about the same speed

172
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,089
if you watched how long you chose to cut

173
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:50,179
a slot all these materials are very very

174
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,099
comparable they're all comparable to

175
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:54,769
aluminum and how fast the machine now

176
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:57,679
the slate can be sanded beautifully they

177
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:01,849
said you send it this is hexo cut can be

178
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,969
water jet cutter perfectly all of these

179
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:06,949
spider a cut with water jet all this is

180
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:09,169
water jet cut so all of them water jet

181
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:12,319
cutter perfectly okay so basically all

182
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,319
can be tapped thread attempt everything

183
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,519
the same as this

184
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,829
you don't need thread itself all these

185
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:21,199
materials can be tapped except to have

186
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,619
alumina so the only disadvantage of

187
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:27,229
slate that if you heat it up near a

188
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,300
thousand degrees it will dilemma Nate

189
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,369
because slate is a layer of material

190
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:32,719
that's why originally it was used

191
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,349
separates easily into layers so if you

192
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,269
design your part in such a way that

193
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,399
there are no strengths needed in this

194
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,039
dimension then it's not a problem for

195
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,649
example if I have some heat a panel and

196
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,839
I have to clamp it down with schools

197
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,600
anyway I don't care if it'll dilemma

198
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,550
Nate inside because there's no force

199
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,709
this way so as long as you design the

200
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:56,290
parts in the right direction

201
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,149
slate right now is their cheapest and

202
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:02,000
best ceramic to use for everything okay

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,880
but because it's not omnidirectional

204
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,390
it's not as nice as say my collegues

205
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,279
because this has the same properties in

206
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,290
all directions okay now and the last

207
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,089
ceramic material I want to mention is

208
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,820
the cornea the cornea is a more exotic

209
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,910
material it is as a ceramic with the one

210
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,279
of the highest hardness s highest

211
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,100
strength the highest melting point so it

212
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,410
is the best of all ceramics especially

213
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,180
if you need thermal insulation because a

214
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,580
luminous strong heart but it's not a

215
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,270
thermal insulator zirconia is stronger

216
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,400
than aluminum have there and the perfect

217
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,320
thermal insulator so this is a magic

218
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,050
material the cornea it's expensive it's

219
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,080
about five to ten times more expensive

220
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,970
but it has a interesting advantage

221
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,870
because for R&D work people use it today

222
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,860
to make crowns or other parts for teas

223
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,910
so which means that in every you can buy

224
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,730
these blocks of zirconia anywhere and

225
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,480
these are soft this is a business are

226
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,520
called green fire so it's a bit like the

227
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,700
soft alumina you can fire into hard so

228
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,600
the softer cornea which is semi fire it

229
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,400
can be machined and again if we look at

230
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,459
the cutting speed again very very

231
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,709
similar to the other ceramics how long

232
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,680
it takes to make a cut okay again like

233
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,830
aluminum so this is the same so if you

234
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,930
need some very exotic power especially

235
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,660
if it's small and it has to take 2,000

236
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,240
degrees am enormous pressures totally

237
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,430
nailed every miracle property combined

238
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,100
you can buy us at one of those which is

239
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,430
a blank for dental insert machine it on

240
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,470
a regular meeting machine of a file and

241
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,470
send it to any dental lab to be sintered

242
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,400
not siddur but they failed because this

243
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,430
cup this is half fired okay now once you

244
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,160
fire it it becomes a material which

245
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,870
cannot be machined at all except with

246
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,410
diamond to leak so here when I do that I

247
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,240
get the same problem in say alumina it

248
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,040
turns black because it's eating up the

249
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,230
file okay

250
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,110
so this is simile very similar to

251
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,150
carbide to tungsten carbide in

252
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,400
properties if you take a chip of this

253
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,380
put it in the laser cut steel was no

254
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,120
problem there's actually cutting tools

255
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,980
made of ceramics but even the regular

256
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,440
zirconia mount that I tried it and will

257
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,230
cut steel very nicely so so this is a

258
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,380
ultimate material but expensive like a

259
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,540
single exist as in cost about a hundred

260
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,690
bucks compared to a piece of slate this

261
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,390
big which cost five bucks so so this is

262
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,310
a expensive material but it's

263
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,230
irreplaceable if you want a very

264
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,060
integrated path that you have to make

265
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,120
yourself one thing to keep in mind when

266
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,210
you fire it the linear dimension shrinks

267
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,510
a lot and it shrinks in the order of 20%

268
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,830
sometimes even more safety so first of

269
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,660
all they give you the shrinkage factor

270
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,150
like say before you make the part you

271
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,860
have to find out the shrinkage vector a

272
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,930
shrinkage factor actually I can tell you

273
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,210
because all that you need to know is the

274
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,550
final density and the density here it

275
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,950
takes a cube root okay so the final

276
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,340
density of this is six so density here

277
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,480
is three point six yeah so it's about

278
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,180
17% or something like this 1517 percent

279
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,580
shrinkage vector that's not spared but

280
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,980
you have to it's quite predictable it's

281
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,000
omnidirectional

282
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,920
but you have to scale all the dimensions

283
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,620
with the shrinkage vector so so these

284
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,530
parties are special pistons they were

285
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,600
made from a blank like this of the

286
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,900
cornea and after firings were finished

287
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,390
diamond machined because of the slight

288
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,550
uncertainty in the shrinkage you want to

289
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,260
leave safe point one point two

290
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,510
millimeter and then your diamond machine

291
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,360
with a diamond grinding wheel but these

292
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,360
are a amazing parts and in terms of

293
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,720
performance one material which has a

294
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,930
unusual properties glass and the unusual

295
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,110
property is that if you make a shape in

296
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,480
glass like a prismatic shape for example

297
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,150
we ground this to a d-shaped

298
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,890
cross-section if you heat up the glass

299
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,320
and draw it it will become thinner and

300
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,360
thinner but it will maintain

301
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,610
even if you ground it to a very sharp

302
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,650
corner like this has and you'd love it

303
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,930
to be a hundredth of the diameter and

304
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,820
you look at the microscope it's a piece

305
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,210
a sharp corner of irritate the accuracy

306
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,280
of retaining the form is about one

307
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,070
micron and of course it's a predictable

308
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,290
process so even if there is an error in

309
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,210
retaining the form there always

310
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,640
repeatable you can measure it and grind

311
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,520
the preform with arrows included so you

312
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,440
can actually get submicron accuracy

313
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,050
after one pass where you measure the

314
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,200
error so this has to be done in the

315
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,630
proper oven which I don't have here but

316
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,160
just to show the principle

317
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,850
kind of gently no the motor connected

318
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,240
himself

319
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,330
okay

320
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,830
like this in the flame

321
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,440
okay now again we have to let it cool

322
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,440
down nicely not to crack it also has to

323
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,300
be done at the right temperature because

324
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,830
if you make it too soft at low flow

325
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,080
together so you have to be careful I'm

326
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,490
not sure that's the right temperature

327
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,660
yeah but it worked

328
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,460
yeah maintained DJ perfectly so now what

329
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,950
we'll do is you can see that it

330
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,520
maintained its v-shaped perfectly okay

331
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,100
so the same demo you just saw a minute

332
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,880
ago about drawing glass keeping its

333
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,280
cross-section shape is a very unique

334
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,800
property which I realize most of you

335
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,750
will never need but if you ever need

336
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,880
there is no substitute to this quality

337
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,180
and the main use of this property is to

338
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,640
make a cylindrical lenses miniature

339
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,030
cylindrical lenses for example this is a

340
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,190
slice form a one football ground on a

341
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,650
CNC grinder to an aspheric ball file

342
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,440
this one foot bar was heated up in the

343
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,220
oven and drawn into these lenses so out

344
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,230
of the one foot bar was a few hundred

345
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,450
feet of these lenses which came out and

346
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,820
these are nearly diffraction limited a

347
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,790
spherically corrected Cinderella lenses

348
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,100
which are used to manufacture the

349
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,590
special micro lenses for lasers so

350
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,050
basically later on they're cut up and

351
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,880
installed in a mount exist

352
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,870
so it's a very esoteric use but if you

353
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,210
need this kind of prismatic shapes

354
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,630
squares triangles a spheric lenses it's

355
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,520
the best process to manufacture them
