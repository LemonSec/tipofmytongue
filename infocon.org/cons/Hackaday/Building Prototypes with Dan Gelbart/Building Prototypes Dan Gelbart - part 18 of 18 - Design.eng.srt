1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,990
okay so this is a very important demo to

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,019
understand

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:12,730
difference between strength and

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,050
stiffness in classical

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,460
technical engineering you're very

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,620
concerned about strengths for example if

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,869
you build a bridge you're mainly worried

8
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:22,970
about the strengths if it's steel cable

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,130
order of the strengths an airplane and

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,580
so on but in instruments and in machine

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,170
tools you're mainly worried about

12
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,900
stiffness if you look at the microscope

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,300
the frame of the microscope probably

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,940
could support one ton while in actually

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,000
use it only supports a glass slide but

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,730
it has to be able to it has to be made

17
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,380
so heavy so when you touch the

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,600
microscope it's completely stiff it

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,359
doesn't flex another example if you look

20
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,629
at the bed of a lays the bed of a laces

21
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:56,120
maybe this see cast iron could support

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,609
easily ten tons but the workpiece

23
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:01,850
Andales is only ten kilo so it's over

24
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,030
designed a thousand x because the

25
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,980
stiffness is what determines that I

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,130
mention of the strength or another good

27
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,550
example is something like this this

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,350
thing doesn't have to take any force

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,390
because you just put it here to see if

30
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,820
things are square but still it has to be

31
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,650
made very very stiff so it doesn't

32
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,440
deflect as you do the measurement so so

33
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,050
in many many industries you are

34
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,790
concerned with stiffness and not with

35
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,710
strength and there's a huge difference

36
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,840
and the best way to understand the

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,570
difference is if I compare the stiffness

38
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,360
of a solid aluminium bar of any metal

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,720
bar to the same bar cutting to in held

40
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,490
with rubber bands okay so obviously the

41
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,040
strength of this is no more than the

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,380
strength of a rubber band but the

43
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,510
question is what about stiffness if I

44
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,090
put an equal load on both how will the

45
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,120
deflections compare so to do the test

46
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,260
more less properly I round at one end so

47
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,970
it doesn't work otherwise because this

48
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,730
is not a precision bow I have to rest it

49
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,550
on three points so it doesn't walk so I

50
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,940
rested here and I take out any play by

51
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,390
pre loading it sets a gauge to zero and

52
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,270
load it with a block of steel and I

53
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,420
measure 12 micron

54
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,340
if you look at the gauge it reads

55
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,440
deflection of 12 micron now I remove the

56
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,560
solid bar replace it with a cut bar with

57
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,300
the rubber band again one side is

58
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,480
rounded so it doesn't work put it down

59
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,690
here I have to shim it because of the

60
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,690
offset make sure it's not sitting on the

61
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,820
rubber band preload it

62
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,470
same as before nail it again okay to

63
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,920
zero and load it again and the

64
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,020
deflection is now seven my code so

65
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,910
something very surprising the bar which

66
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,920
is held by a rubber band from two pieces

67
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,860
is actually much stiffer than the solid

68
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,430
bar now the reason it's not just equally

69
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,700
stiff but still fair is as long as these

70
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,820
two pieces don't separate this section

71
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,700
behaves like a solid piece and because

72
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,980
that solid piece is twice as thick as

73
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,100
the original bar that section the middle

74
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,650
is much stiffer it's eight times stiffer

75
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,780
theoretically because it's double the

76
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,030
thickness so though this it has no

77
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,250
strengths at all it is twice as stiff

78
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,890
than a solid bar almost twice as this

79
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,239
and a solid well okay so another subject

80
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,269
which comes up in design is how to mount

81
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,940
pulleys and bearings and things like

82
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,370
that so a couple of simple things to

83
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,310
keep in mind if you look at timing belt

84
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,019
pulleys or other puh-leeze

85
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,600
a lot of them come with a set school now

86
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,350
if you tighten the set screw how here

87
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,690
where you should you will not be able to

88
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,700
take it off later even if you loosen it

89
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,650
and the reason is because the set school

90
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,739
will make a little dent in the metal and

91
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:16,810
that dent will interfere with sliding it

92
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,238
off so the first thing you have to do if

93
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:20,950
you want to use that schools you have to

94
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,220
file flats okay if it has to have a

95
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,080
higher torque you have to cause drill

96
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,930
with a pin okay but let's goes for most

97
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,580
small things are enough as long as you

98
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,120
find flats that's a fair thing now a

99
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,090
better type of clamping especially if

100
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,700
you have a water jet is

101
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,680
some kind of lecture based clamping

102
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,110
where you have a housing which flexes

103
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,580
and grips so this is an example of this

104
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,190
kind of lecture based clamping where you

105
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,670
have a split piece with a school you put

106
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:59,310
it on here and when you tighten the

107
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,410
school is a split piece squeeze it

108
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,050
around the shaft this doesn't matter the

109
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,780
shaft and distribute the load all around

110
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,490
it that's a much better clamping system

111
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,460
and if you're going to machine the

112
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,400
pulley any way you can machine in with

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,530
the water jet some cuts you can also use

114
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,630
a taper plug idea we've seen before

115
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,630
for one side to do it okay the other

116
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,450
subject which comes up is how to mount

117
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,360
the shaft on bearings so the first thing

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
two things to keep in mind that a

119
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,660
bearing a single bearing by itself has a

120
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,610
lot of play and they are designed to

121
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,310
have play so this pairing is a perfect

122
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,400
fit on the shaft but if I put it up here

123
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,460
and hold it you can see how much play

124
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,220
that is in the shaft

125
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,780
okay the place not between the shaft and

126
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,430
the bearing the place in the bearing

127
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,980
itself so there's about this much plane

128
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,810
every bearing game the most precise

129
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,180
bearing because these bearings were

130
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,550
designed always to walk in pre-loaded

131
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,060
pairs so if I wanted to make this shaft

132
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,940
in a housing I would put a bearing at

133
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,850
each end and I would preload the

134
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,300
bearings against each other okay so I

135
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,590
can preload them easier by putting a

136
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,420
step on the outside or step on the

137
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,950
inside so for example an easy way to

138
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,260
preload bearings is to put a sleeve on

139
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,910
the shaft right now here I just put a

140
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,680
sleeve on the shaft because I'm trying

141
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
to use a standard off-the-shelf shaft

142
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,180
like a dowel pin so I don't have to

143
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,460
machine it so just slide the sleeve over

144
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,960
it and now what I want to do is push the

145
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,170
two bearings by the housing to squeeze

146
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,090
them together against the sleeve so

147
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,700
they'll preload it now if the housing

148
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,740
isn't accurate enough and you are

149
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,129
worried about the preload

150
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:54,129
odhh the usual way to solve it is by

151
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:57,339
putting a spring washer a wave washer a

152
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:00,610
wave washer is a washer which has a wavy

153
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,919
shape which can be squeezed to be flat

154
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,110
so if I put a wave washer here and a

155
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,489
bearing the preload is not so critical

156
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:14,319
because there is some flex in the washer

157
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,019
so I flatten out the washer and now if I

158
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:21,330
do that there is no plane the shaft okay

159
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,849
now if I wanted to put this into a

160
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:27,339
housing made from spot-welded sheet

161
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:30,629
metal the wall thickness is too thin to

162
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:33,759
hold the bearing so what you'd have to

163
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,949
do you'd have to when you fabricate the

164
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:39,099
box you will have to beef up the wall a

165
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,419
bit and if you look at this gearbox look

166
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,360
at this gearbox you can see that you can

167
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,189
see the wave washer he'll be loading the

168
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:50,259
bearing but you can see there was some

169
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:53,169
water jet cut additional plates which

170
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:55,539
are permanently mounted with schools on

171
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:58,300
the box and these are thick enough to

172
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,829
contain the bearing okay now so the

173
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:05,289
question is how can you get them exactly

174
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,539
aligned because of course you can't

175
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:09,639
really rely on bending the sheet metal

176
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,069
to align it so the way it was done here

177
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:16,990
part of the alignment came from the fact

178
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,889
that I'm using welded nuts which have

179
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,069
self aligning holes and I'm using flat

180
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:26,829
head schools which have a taper so when

181
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:29,499
I tighten the flat head schools they

182
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:32,469
pull into position this part but it's

183
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:35,740
only accurate for low precision stuff if

184
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,659
this was high precision stuff I would

185
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,630
have to line bore it line Bhavik meaning

186
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,029
after it's all assembled I would have to

187
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:46,329
poorly put it without the motor of

188
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:47,949
course I would have to put it on a dream

189
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:51,850
and dreams who both pieces at once

190
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,490
or if it has to be more accurate I'll

191
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,350
have to take a bowling head with a long

192
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,620
tool and both of the first and go down

193
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,910
both of the second in one Mountie

194
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:07,700
okay now a so is the inside shaft would

195
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,770
have to have some space there now these

196
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,040
would have to have some snapping inside

197
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,730
too because it's how to bow is a step

198
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,940
where the step is on the inside so the

199
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,090
easiest way to do it here would be to

200
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,720
cut a groove with the bowling head put

201
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,220
in a snapping in the Gulf

202
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,320
so the bearings will fit into these

203
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,140
blocks and be properly stopped by the

204
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,240
snapping and this tube will be long

205
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,210
enough to preload just here there's

206
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,030
another possibility which is also okay

207
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,150
if it doesn't if it's not loaded heavily

208
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,060
you can use regular schools flat head

209
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,490
schools you can pre bore these plates

210
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,760
and you can align them after assembly so

211
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,890
they and you can maybe epoxy them in

212
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,020
place the difference is that if you

213
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,970
align it after assembly and it gets

214
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,940
knocked to go out of alignment if it's

215
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,270
registered with a step and both the step

216
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,000
holds it in place but here in this case

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,430
the easiest would actually be to prepare

218
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,300
two pieces which have a board step so

219
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,850
the bearing cannot come out and then you

220
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,190
put them in and then you align the

221
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,440
second one to the first one after the

222
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,380
whole thing is built now one thing I

223
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,590
should say about bearings that first of

224
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,780
all a very good supply of O'Berry this

225
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,200
is V xB bearings comm which which are

226
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,820
very good bearings very cheap but what's

227
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,160
more interesting so there's one size of

228
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,500
bearing which is outstanding and

229
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,110
outstanding by and this is the eight

230
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,230
millimeter ID by 22 millimeter

231
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,020
OD bearing and this bearing cost about

232
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,630
25 cents even it's very very high

233
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,050
quality like a big v comparable and the

234
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,640
reason they are they're cheap because

235
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,740
they're used by all skateboards so there

236
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,620
are such huge supply that you can get so

237
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,450
so cheap and so try to use a voyeur

238
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,420
everything you can the other bearing

239
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,220
self all about a buck apiece which is

240
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,970
also very cheap

241
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,819
be very very careful as you know the

242
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:17,370
bearings are rated by the a bit quality

243
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,129
a big three a big 5 X 7 so this one

244
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,589
company supplying this bearing that the

245
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,389
company name is a big seven

246
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:26,250
so be very very careful when you see in

247
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,829
the add a big seven bearings if it's if

248
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:31,050
it's not G bearings made by the a big

249
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,550
seven company set sold by DX B but even

250
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,639
the general G bearings for 99% of the

251
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,800
jobs are accurate enough now other one

252
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,170
has a point if you end up with a feat

253
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,240
which is a bit too loose like the

254
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,040
bearing is a bit too loose on the shaft

255
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,069
to lose means as any play of the bearing

256
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:55,439
is too loose in the housing then the

257
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:57,089
lock type provides a pretty good

258
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:58,769
solution you just put one drop of

259
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,470
Loctite let it run all around it has a

260
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,079
very high wetting power so as soon as

261
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,790
you add a drop of Loctite it'll run all

262
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,129
around you have to set it overnight and

263
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:11,040
it will take up the gap if you ever have

264
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,379
to push it out after it was locked I Ted

265
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,120
you have to heat it up with a heat gun

266
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,420
to about 150 C then it's often same as

267
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,459
epoxy once you heat it up around 50 see

268
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,550
it's completely soft you can push it out

269
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,019
okay so let's just talk about a few

270
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,540
minutes about design philosophy how do

271
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,199
you approach designing a part so the

272
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,170
first rule of design is so there's a

273
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,620
hierarchy in ease of making things the

274
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,449
easiest thing in the cheapest thing is

275
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:42,149
mixing some wire if you can't make it of

276
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:45,000
wire in starting your sheet metal if you

277
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,620
can't make it of sheet metal you start

278
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,620
thinking of solid okay but if there is a

279
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,139
easy way to make it of why here both is

280
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,540
one off in production it's a fastest

281
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,509
good example is this wire bottle caps

282
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:03,779
you put it down latches beautifully it

283
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,629
opens beautifully so especially if you

284
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:09,120
design for production the reason there

285
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,600
is two reasons why design with wire is

286
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,120
cheaper than anything else the first

287
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,699
reason is that if you make things for

288
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:20,519
Wilder zero-waste making it from any

289
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,860
other material has waste alright because

290
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,200
the wire comes on it's pool absolutely

291
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,720
or waste the second thing is as minimal

292
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,610
finishing because you don't have to

293
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,040
deburr the corners you only have sharp

294
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,680
end to the wildest is all smooth if you

295
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,690
bend it smartly the sharp end this

296
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,670
hidden like in this case where it's

297
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,350
hidden here or hidden in the glass

298
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,199
it's not a barrack but there is another

299
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,779
reason especially these days why if you

300
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,699
design for production you always think

301
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:51,750
of wire first because there are CNC

302
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,810
machines which bend wire into any shape

303
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:58,050
very cheaply and in the old days it was

304
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,389
a machine with a mechanical setup it was

305
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:03,089
to legals expensive but the new type of

306
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,389
machines the wire is just fed out like

307
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:09,110
this from a bushing and there are four

308
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,970
computer-controlled fingers which bend

309
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,160
the wire as it's fed from the bushing so

310
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,769
as the wire or cube could be cubed to as

311
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:18,990
it fell out of the bushing it's bent and

312
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,420
because you have four fingers it can be

313
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,600
bent in anywhere in a full circle so

314
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,540
this whole piece can be actually fed out

315
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,990
from a CNC wire band there and you see

316
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,029
take shape in the air by itself without

317
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:35,570
any tooling and that's an immense

318
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,750
advantage that there is no tool link to

319
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,930
get any shape you want okay so this is

320
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,630
why now if you can't make it from wire

321
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,630
you start thinking of sheet metal and we

322
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,550
talked a lot about water jet and sheet

323
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,880
metal so we don't have to cover it but I

324
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,430
think some things was actually walk very

325
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,040
well with sheet metal and even better

326
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,459
than solid an example for exact an

327
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,810
example is this is something very common

328
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,720
say for a computer terminal hall there

329
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,850
are monitor you want something which is

330
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,230
easily adjustable and easily lockable

331
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,750
okay so this thing when you lock it it's

332
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,209
totally rigid much more rigid than any

333
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:23,910
machine from solid lock is the reason of

334
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,389
this is it has many many surfaces so the

335
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,660
total friction gets multiplied by the

336
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,360
number of surfaces basically same idea

337
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,120
is what's called a multi-disc clutch

338
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,680
some clutch mechanical engineering

339
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,670
called the multi disk

340
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,400
the same principle so a very small hinge

341
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,410
can be locked and heavy men's locking

342
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,200
power so so ensure the sink is that a

343
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,060
way to make it of sheet metal instead of

344
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,770
machining it because once you achieve

345
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,930
metal of course all the techniques we

346
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,890
looked at before come in handy if you if

347
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,720
doesn't work has to be built from solid

348
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,420
you can make it from solid but now when

349
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,180
you make it from solid you start looking

350
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,310
at the a key or see and it's a precision

351
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,340
of the parts and you start thinking

352
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,770
about it first what are you after

353
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,090
I already explained before the

354
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,650
difference between strength and

355
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,800
stiffness are you after stiffness or

356
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,620
after strength and if you need precision

357
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,430
parts here a are they adjust able or not

358
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,710
if they are not adjustable and you

359
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,680
really rely on both false precision so

360
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,140
there's really no shortcuts yes you have

361
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,360
to be like this left or scraped and

362
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,190
everything has to be but sometimes and

363
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,770
you think of it things are adjustable

364
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,740
and you just want the precision feel you

365
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,750
want adjustability you want a nice

366
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,990
smooth feel but the absolute position is

367
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,600
actually adjustable and in this cases

368
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,090
you can achieve a very nice position

369
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,320
feel just by having one side accurate

370
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,310
for example if you have a set screw

371
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,870
adjusting some over school adjusting

372
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,160
something it feels quite rough reason

373
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,410
why it feels rough because the end of

374
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,980
the school is bare it's not resize the

375
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,560
surface its resting on immediately get

376
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,329
scratched by the school and it's rough

377
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:18,210
and the whole thing feels rough ok so

378
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,300
when you try to adjust it to a micron

379
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,640
it's quite a rough adjustment but if you

380
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,829
just put a ball from a ball bearing

381
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,130
between the school in the surface okay

382
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,590
it feels completely smooth and the

383
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,200
reason is that even if one surface is

384
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,270
rough it slides on a very smooth surface

385
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,990
it feels completely smooth so you have

386
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,510
to think is that any place where I can

387
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,030
insert precision parts into what I'm

388
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,700
designing without having to machine into

389
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,580
position so if you have shaft and holes

390
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,030
you can use very

391
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,400
sighs pins like dowel pins or although

392
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,770
wearing pins so you don't have to make

393
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,350
the shaft precise you can buy precise if

394
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,360
there is any kind of adjustment is the

395
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,730
best idea is this ball in the adjustment

396
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,940
to give it a nice feel some other ideas

397
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,650
like that but basically you have to

398
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,710
remember if you don't need the strength

399
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,200
of the stiffness if you just need a nice

400
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,410
feel of position you don't have to do

401
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,840
all this okay just me say if this was

402
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,420
rough and it's sliding on a perfect

403
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,300
surface it already feels smooth so you

404
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,310
and if you can insert this perfect

405
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,620
surface without having to make it then

406
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,430
you achieve what you want now the second

407
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,910
thing you have to think of the design is

408
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,270
this a design for an instrument which

409
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,160
means there's really no load on it it

410
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,840
has to be very accurate but there's no

411
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,210
load on it oh is this a design for a

412
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,030
machine which has yes the huge stiffness

413
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,040
has to carry heavy load and maybe has to

414
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,040
be wear resistant so if it's a design

415
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,440
for an instrument you can use techniques

416
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,660
like a kinematic mount which is very

417
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,290
convenient it can be removed replaced

418
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,240
self-adjusting it's very convenient if

419
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,730
you have surfaces resting on each other

420
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,070
it can rest a very small points so it's

421
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,900
very little lapping or a little fixing

422
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,480
but if it's a machine which carries a

423
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,370
big load you can't use any of these

424
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,040
concepts because the kinematic mount by

425
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,440
definition it's a point contact if you

426
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,390
have a point contact it cannot carry any

427
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,400
load because it would be infinite

428
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,980
pressure at the point so basically what

429
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,470
will happen it will indent so if you

430
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,450
have three balls in three V grooves as

431
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,240
kinematic mounds you have basically six

432
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,190
contact points and if you put pressure

433
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,170
there will be infinite pressure these

434
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,060
contact points and deform the grooves so

435
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,070
there is a big difference between

436
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,050
designing an instrument in designing a

437
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,210
machine like a machine tool because

438
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,510
machine tool pretty well relies on over

439
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,910
constrained design or full surface

440
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,880
bearing like this was while an

441
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,160
instrument it can get away with

442
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,650
kinematic mounds point contacts and so

443
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,470
on so this is another dimension to the

444
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,640
design that you have to think about it

445
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,130
now other things you have to think about

446
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,220
it is if it's the design of a product

447
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,260
not the design of an experiment if it's

448
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,659
something which will be repeated there's

449
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:16,130
a lot of things you have to think of the

450
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,220
design in terms of lifetime cost for

451
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,190
example the single F to be maintained so

452
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,830
parts have to be easily removable access

453
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,350
has to be proper and so on and we

454
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,000
wouldn't get into that here this course

455
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,909
but one thing I found out people always

456
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:34,640
underestimate if there is any kind of

457
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,580
electrical cabling needed so I say if

458
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,470
you design some server system and you

459
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,110
layout bearings and covers and

460
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,240
everything you never most people don't

461
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,279
think so where all the cables will go

462
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,620
and then when it's built it's a mess

463
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,690
because you didn't leave enough room to

464
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,779
out the cable so anything electrical

465
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:55,370
when you finish the design you have to

466
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,380
lay out exactly what every wire should

467
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,630
go every plug every strain relief and

468
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,389
built it into the design if you have in

469
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:05,330
one system hydraulics and electrical

470
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,580
which is very common like in a CNC

471
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,010
machines and so on make sure we always

472
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,519
put all the water or hydraulic till

473
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,460
being below the electrical wiring for

474
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,830
obvious reasons the electricity never

475
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,620
drips and leaks so so when you open the

476
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,899
cabinet all the electrical relays and

477
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,639
everything have to be a pop all the

478
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:27,440
water hydraulics have to be on the

479
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,840
bottom if it's air it could be on top as

480
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,539
well then you are not to walk it so

481
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:35,000
there's a lot of considerations when you

482
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,370
think of something for long life and

483
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,250
production it's a bit easier if you just

484
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,059
make a one-off or a test for yourself so

485
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,450
that's basically the general approach to

486
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,389
design so it's also an aesthetic aspect

487
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:53,210
because especially in a product but even

488
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,630
for your own gratification it has to

489
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,120
look nice so it's a very interesting

490
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,690
rule that if something is 100 percent

491
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,450
functional it's always beautiful so for

492
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,250
example there is no such thing as an

493
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,799
ugly nail of an ugly hammer but there's

494
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,010
lots of ugly cars okay because in a car

495
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,899
not everything is functional you have

496
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:16,730
all kinds of spoilers and additions

497
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,420
which are not

498
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,430
shanell so sometimes it's very beautiful

499
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,100
if if the personal design it is very

500
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,950
good taste sometimes it's ugly but if

501
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,840
you look at something 100% functional

502
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,020
it's always beautiful like airplanes are

503
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,900
all beautiful because there is no homes

504
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,200
there for additional weight okay also if

505
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,970
you design a part where there is no

506
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,400
extra metal in other words when it's IND

507
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,820
out where the low stress areas are it's

508
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,720
always beautiful

509
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,530
I think for example of a Boeing arrow

510
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,770
for bow so a classical bow is seen at

511
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,440
the ends because it's less stress there

512
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,480
but if you made a bow which gets wider

513
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,700
at the end it looks ugly because

514
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,440
intuitively you would feel it's not

515
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,180
handle that functional there's extra

516
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,760
material that you don't need so it's a

517
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,240
good rule to keep in mind is if you want

518
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,910
it to look beautiful just design it to

519
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,270
be 100% functional they'll remove all

520
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,070
the material which is not needed it will

521
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,220
become beautiful by itself that's it
