00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
I decided to build a brain box as a

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,529
response to some situations I

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,779
encountered here in Papua New Guinea out

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,510
there in the bush people don't have the

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,179
electricity they don't have access to

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,089
communication sometimes they buy some

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,640
cheap or used solar panels from the

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,359
local bazaars they don't have money to

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,210
buy a good battery or a decent solar

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,050
charger they just hook up the wires of

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,750
the solar panel directly to the leads of

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,690
an old truck battery we go hunting in

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,180
the bush and when they come back in the

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,600
afternoon they find their houses burned

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,059
to the ground I like the idea of the

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,690
Hecate prize two challenges always

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,270
motivate people it's really motivating

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,780
for me to find more details about my

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,840
project and don't forget to subscribe to
