1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,370
it's a water quality sensor that is able

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,830
to generate three maps of water quality

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,940
for a body of water

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,189
seeing that water quality monitoring is

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,410
really important for managing fisheries

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,990
protecting public health pinpointing

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,880
pollution and just in the face of

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,800
climate change is important we get a

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,350
comprehensive baseline of data so we can

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,250
notice new and you know subtle trends

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,070
I've taken a naturalistic or ecological

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,199
approach to the design by doing an open

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,070
source that means that a lot of

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,019
different individuals can contribute

15
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,940
their specific knowledge and expertise

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,410
which is something that I don't think

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,690
that anyone would do for a for-profit

18
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,760
company even if they are working for the

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,860
public good Hackett is has been a real

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,440
source of inspiration for me it's been

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,969
the main hub for me to find out about

22
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,190
some really cool electronics and

23
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,200
plastics projects like a prize it's

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,309
great for this project because it

25
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,590
provides a framework not only does it

26
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,140
have a schedule and incentives community

27
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,809
and the staff at hackaday are really

28
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,219
working hard to help pull together these

29
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,699
projects
