1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510
this project is a means to create

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,859
humanizing interactions in both the

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:21,930
digital and physical spaces the screen

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,519
of the television has been replaced by

5
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,070
an LED matrix that's actually

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,769
controllable by twitchchat so if you're

7
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,840
on the internet anywhere in the world

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,030
you can actually get a sense of

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,370
community from interacting with me as

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,620
well as controlling the television while

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,510
I'm interacting with those in my

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,690
community using technology to create

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,850
more humanizing moments is vastly

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,950
important for the future of technology

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,809
and the future of our society and

16
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,870
communities both locally and globally

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,129
