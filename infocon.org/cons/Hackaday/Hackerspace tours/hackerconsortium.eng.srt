yarn so we host classes in here or we're

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,610
doing soldering your things like that in

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,469
a classroom setting we have the space

15
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:45,660
for it we'll go this way we step into

16

things we rebuilt the bathroom I i would

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,949
suggest it anyone who has a hackerspace

23
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,350
have a nice bathroom at least have a

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,600

here we're all hand-built by mudflap you

28
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,750
have the HC in the backsplash there that

29
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,360
was it's always good to have somebody

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,479
who's very good at procuring you cannot

31
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,090
get a small number of tiles in that

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,579
color red without you finagling or

33
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,850
buying a full case so he's in charge of

34
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,740
our procurement he got a little

35
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,500
backsplash going on there very nice we

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,240
have a lounge area that's where the last

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
areas of the space that we've been

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,649
working on and then we've been working

39
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,619
on it for about a year and a half we

40
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:50,440
just haven't

41
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,850
had a chance to finish everything out

42
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,390
yet but we're talking about having

43
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,860
gaming screens and things like that in

44
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,960
their large screen stuff fun so will

45
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,580
step down stairs into the warehouse area

46
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,690
we have much laughs our intrepid

47
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,419
acquirer greetings he's trying to hide

48
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:18,030
the beer action anyway we have lockers

49
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,870
full of our standards

50
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,250
we publish Walker standards to fit into

51
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,020
the racks we gave you an external sighs

52
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,960
and you were the one who had to figure

53
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,160
out how to actually put everything

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,480
together and make it fit inside the

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,900
space the key baby when you put it in

56
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,010
there not easy to get out at someone

57
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,840
else packs things on top of yours so

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,820
when you put it in and make sure it's

59
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,570
done right the first time

60
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,760
oh we have life this is our server room

61
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,990
it's a little bit loud but it serves the

62
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,030
purpose we have one rack it's nothing

63
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,290
but production equipment for the

64
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,330
consortium itself along with

65
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,600
surveillance and things of that nature

66
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,010
Cynthia more stuff working there

67
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,840
well another rack that specifically

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,879
former members the ends so basically

69
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,590
anyone who wants to put a server we've

70
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,390
got five static ip's they can play

71
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,120
around you can set up the networking

72
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,879
however you like third empty rack

73
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,290
because we haven't had that many people

74
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,830
fire up of taylor yeah

75
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,220
with 16 kb a

76
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,010
10kva ups full of lead acid batteries

77
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,750
that will run this room for

78
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,340
approximately an hour and a half the

79
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,090
printer what happened to go out in the

80
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,460
back side behind the UPS it's a full

81
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,300
rfid access control system that takes

82
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,100
care of all the access control issues we

83
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,700
might have

84
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,489
getting in and out of the building air

85
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:51,220
conditioning of fun things in here

86
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,709
that's why it's extremely loud

87
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:59,290
appreciate that sort of the main work

88
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,910
wearhouse area it's a it's a delightful

89
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,480
mix of messed up and dirty but it works

90
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,650
we have about 24 linear feet of work

91
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,080
table surface here we found we used to

92
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,418
have them broken out individually tabled

93
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:19,519
and looking at all the other

94
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,079
hackerspaces we found that everyone

95
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,990
preferred sort of a community feel one

96
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,910
long table everyone sat around you need

97
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,010
easier to talk to people you didn't have

98
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,650
to walk in and out of the tables so i

99
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,479
use NYC resistor was one of the main

100
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,389
places we saw this at so we changed it

101
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,350
around made it more community seating we

102
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,300
have the requisite snack machine with no

103
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,190
snacks which works really well for

104
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,419
surveillance all cameras all over the

105
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,650
outside the building that way when you

106
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,960
knock on the door we know who's there we

107
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,620
have to worry about that everyone needs

108
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,610
a 36-inch wide laser printer those it's

109
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,810
interesting some of the things you can

110
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,680
collect like that

111
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,330
color printer everyone needs an

112
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,430
electronic piano one of our members is

113
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,540
actually going through and putting

114
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,740
electronic pickups in it so it's either

115
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,880
going to work or we're going to blow it

116
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,400
out to take your pick lots of other fun

117
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,820
things one of our members has done some

118
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,560
boxing before so you brought it on heavy

119
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,630
bag in and we've been known to pull it

120
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,820
down and actually do a little bit of

121
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,010
heavy bag work work out some stress in

122
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,120
the office we have sort of the

123
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,490
hackerspace standard the 40 watt FS

124
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,630
laser the sort of standard package I

125
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,880
suggest everyone who wants to do any

126
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,740
kind of rapid prototyping and play with

127
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,150
acrylic this is the thing to go with

128
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,870
it's about three grand a little bit of

129
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,190
finagling and get things like that but

130
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,100
definitely worth it tools on the wall

131
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,060
was just originally our main tool bench

132
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,560
they've kind of migrated all over the

133
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,030
place people have a tendency to pick it

134
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,420
up and lay it down somewhere else so

135
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,620
have a lot of the woodworking machines

136
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,430
over here in the middle drill press Saul

137
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,310
a table saw be careful the table saw

138
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,220
these fingers that kind of thing we did

139
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,770
a lot of showing I'm the first got into

140
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,630
the building up front we'll put all our

141
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,560
raw materials monitors one of the things

142
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,410
we found as people are very very happy

143
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,790
to give you all of their old crap

144
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,500
whether you like it or not oh yeah and

145
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,440
unfortunately you'll collect it in a lot

146
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,550
of ways and have to go through and

147
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,980
sorted on a regular basis but lots of

148
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,700
shelving worked up pretty well for us

149
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,130
and then I guess on the other side we've

150
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,930
got a couple of things here I get to

151
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,710
brag on my flat for a minute

152
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,080
a good seat we found the stainless steel

153
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,660
sink which none of us has taken a bath

154
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,370
in it yet but I think a few of us would

155
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,160
actually fit into it and another

156
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,440
recommended item have wire fed welder we

157
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,620
have the everyone needs the shopping

158
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,490
cart chair this is one of the more

159
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,520
comfortable chairs in the building I've

160
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,530
been told that the shopping cart came

161
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,990
from a broken home and then we gave it a

162
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,940
place to stay so it was Oh perfectly

163
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,060
legal and stuff like that oh yeah so and

164
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,230
then one of the problems that we had

165
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,070
originally was heat we got a one of the

166
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,140
forced heat were forced fuel heaters

167
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,540
from home depot but the trouble is it

168
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,180
goes to a fair amount of fuel so what we

169
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,500
ended up doing mudflat took a gas water

170
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,710
heater tank gutted it put an access

171
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,070
hatch in it and a piece of stove pipe on

172
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,800
the top and it's actually a waste oil

173
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,410
heater so it's got a small needle valve

174
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,960
on the back in a drip tube which goes

175
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,670
into a six-inch diameter aluminum plate

176
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,250
on the bottom of the taper it takes a

177
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,090
little bit of kerosene paper towel or

178
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,200
two a little bit of oil to get it

179
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,930
started once it starts the outside skin

180
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,400
but we'll get to about five or six

181
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,010
hundred degrees so if you heat the space

182
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,200
originally with a fuel force field

183
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,790
heater who get it up to temperature

184
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,590
enough to make it comfortable and this

185
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,760
will sustain it for the rest of the day

186
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,380
and let's face it who doesn't have

187
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,790
enough waste oil sitting around if you

188
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,370
have a car yeah well it worked well for

189
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,490
us made it where we could heat the place

190
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,200
without breaking the bank which is

191
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,159
entirely possible to do

192
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,958
and tool boxes boxes of stuff that's

193
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,740
pretty much it alright great well thank

194
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,360
you very much for the tour absolutely

195
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,449
