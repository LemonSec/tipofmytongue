1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,049
hi my name is Matt I'm a writer at

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,240
hackaday and today we're gonna do a

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,080
hackerspace

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,670
tour this time around we're gonna check

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,460
out Pasadena City College and see what

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,100
their Fab Lab looks like so let's check

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,310
that out

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:29,350
I'll show you the PCC Fab Lab so this

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,630
area is basically the workstation with

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,630
Fab Lab where design tech pathway uses

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,060
along with the Engineering club along

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,550
with machine shop engineering department

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,130
everyone comes here and work any project

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,360
physically choose any machine team some

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,400
of the engineers students are at the

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,800
rate art center race so these are the

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,920
parts and prototypes and finals that

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,290
they have been working on for the whole

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:56,860
summer

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,410
and yesterday it was the during the

21
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,019
competition of the race the last day

22
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:07,600
it's our Arab early laser before we had

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,700
an error vanilli outside but it was

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,159
causing too much toxic for people who

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,140
were just walking past my so he finally

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,930
got to validator and the purple ones are

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,060
older ones so this one's for the newer

28
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,980
laser cutter and then repairs on

29
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,320
machines out where mostly people who

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,030
have taken machine shop are allowed to

31
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,330
use it or has an instructor visual so

32
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,490
the chainsaw the scene sees what mostly

33
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,760
student use to use the computer lab

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,450
you

35
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,649
you see as a computer and then the lathe

36
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:45,840
not much students use it because most of

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,090
them have been taken the machine shop

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,659
except the older engineers so we also

39
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,789
got to talk with the design technology

40
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,250
pathway director let's see what she had

41
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,860
to say hi I'm Debra bird and I'm the

42
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,509
director of the design technology

43
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,149
pathway and this is our Fab Lab we're a

44
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,239
program here at Pasadena City College an

45
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,310
innovative program based on new

46
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,560
technology we're preparing students for

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,000
the wide range of design fabrication

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,690
technology careers for the future so the

49
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,760
model that we're using is one really

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,829
based on developing collaboration and

51
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:28,590
teamwork students come in they work on

52
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,420
project-based learning so they're

53
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,569
solving real problems in the real world

54
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,209
so for example the models for visually

55
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,959
impaired students for campus maps etc

56
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,420
the goal is to have the students develop

57
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,970
the skills of collaboration and

58
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,150
communication soft skills and also to

59
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,670
develop a lifelong learning approach to

60
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,310
technology so the technology is taught

61
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,069
not as a standalone element but more as

62
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:58,650
an integral part of the design and

63
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,040
problem-solving process our students

64
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,989
come from a wide range of backgrounds

65
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,060
we're primarily working with incoming

66
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,739
high school students but we're

67
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,139
increasingly expanding our model to

68
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,720
include community access to the Fab Lab

69
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,650
and work experience opportunities that

70
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,530
are also problem-based so students can

71
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,200
come in and expect integrated academics

72
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,680
math English College Success we use a

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,370
series of stackable

74
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,980
that move towards transfer so students

75
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,780
can anticipate coming in and getting

76
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,330
real world work skills right from the

77
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,159
very beginning that can then

78
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,560
increasingly pay off as students move up

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,420
and transfer to four-year and and

80
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,920
further educational opportunities now

81
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,269
one of the projects that Deborah was

82
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,829
talking about was a map for the blind

83
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:50,260
and we wanted to find out a little bit

84
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,000
more about this project so we asked a

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,549
few students what it was like working on

86
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:57,930
it so let's find out what that is about

87
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,230
so on the top version you see you see

88
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,959
the first prototype that we did it's a

89
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,849
we use um no and you see it like this so

90
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,040
we use wood as the back because we

91
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,510
thought the plastic was a little bit too

92
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,879
weak but we found out that the plastic

93
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:19,899
was well it was pretty strong so so the

94
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,380
issue was um the weight and we also um

95
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,080
had people had a visually impaired

96
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,270
people read it and they seem to like the

97
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,639
texture they seem to like the doorway

98
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,650
you know all the stairs they can they

99
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,289
can read all that the only issue is um

100
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,870
they wanted us to change the ramps here

101
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,900
do you and also um the triangles here

102
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,000
they weren't they wanted this to be a

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,840
bathroom and also the letterings were

104
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,020
confusing and then some of the Brill's

105
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,039
were a little mixed up so on this final

106
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,470
product we changed the ramps here we

107
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,389
also simplify the letters here we also

108
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,610
change this to an arrow and the restroom

109
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,849
became also going triangle what I found

110
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:15,729
most challenging about this project was

111
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,319
was the design element who's like was

112
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,050
trying to step out of a visual world

113
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,789
trying to step out of a sighted world

114
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:26,860
and really trying to be in the footsteps

115
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,400
of the visually impaired like how do

116
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,669
these how do these textures translate to

117
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:35,559
visually impaired people trying to

118
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:38,740
understand scale thankfully we have the

119
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,120
disabled students program here on campus

120
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,180
and we went to them for a lot of help

121
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,569
and show them our models and yeah it was

122
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:49,330
very very interesting just stepping out

123
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,520
of the realm and just imagining what it

124
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,979
would be like to experience a space

125
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,370
without without vision from the looks of

126
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,490
it it seems that PCC is bringing

127
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,099
together an awesome combination of tools

128
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:06,189
and resources and education techniques

129
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:08,409
but where are they getting the money for

130
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:16,120
this our funding model is based on a

131
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,009
series of grants that we've received

132
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:20,949
both from the state and federal levels

133
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,039
we started with a very small in-house

134
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:27,520
front from the Innovation Fund at

135
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,770
Pasadena City College and that bought

136
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,539
our very first piece of equipment which

137
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:33,339
was a laser cutter and that was about

138
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:35,469
three years ago and since then we've

139
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:37,360
been really fortunate we were awarded a

140
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,270
title five grant because we are a

141
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,199
hispanic-serving institution about 25%

142
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,490
of our students

143
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,110
Hispanic we have a lot of students who

144
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,229
are first-time college students and also

145
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,150
we have a lot of students who are coming

146
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,240
in with major financial obstacles so

147
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,039
we've provided a lot of wraparound

148
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,050
services through this front including

149
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,520
including tutoring mentoring we have a

150
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,409
college success course that's part of a

151
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:08,539
structure pathway the students have

152
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:11,060
priority enrollment so they get access

153
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,099
to the classes they need when they need

154
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,279
them and we also provide lab facilities

155
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,529
and the technology that you see around

156
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:21,710
is intended for student use and the Fab

157
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,680
Lab is intended to create this community

158
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,389
which the students really need then you

159
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:28,789
replace that is their own in order to

160
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:31,849
really have a meaningful college

161
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:34,189
experience we know that if students can

162
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:36,199
persist through the first couple of

163
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,270
semesters if they get to 30 units of

164
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,339
credit they are much more likely to

165
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,189
complete their degree at the AMA level

166
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:46,039
and move on to transfer we've also

167
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:48,439
recently been awarded two additional

168
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,870
grants at the state level through the

169

Career Pathways trust one is in advanced

170
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,479
manufacturing and that will be in

171
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,789
collaboration with Long Beach Community

172
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:01,599
College and the other for which we are

173
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,810
PCC is the fiscal lead is the Career

174
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,629
Pathways trust grant for information

175
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,909
communication technology and that covers

176
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:13,189
a broad range of technologies all the

177
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,759
way from entertainment arts media

178
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,120
through to computer science this is this

179
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,349
ground is part of a much larger

180
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,469
consortia with eight different community

181
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:25,520
colleges and six

182
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,580
my schools so the funding model is is

183
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,860
great we have assured funding for the

184
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,399
next four to five years but we intend to

185
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,399
increasingly institutionalize the cost

186
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,320
of running this program through

187
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,419
entrepreneurial activities through work

188
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,179
experience for the students and so a

189
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:46,610
little that is built into the financial

190
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,350
models of these grants as we move

191
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,310
forward so that was our hackerspace tour

192
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,200
hope you enjoyed it and look for the

193
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,500
next one

194
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,619
you
