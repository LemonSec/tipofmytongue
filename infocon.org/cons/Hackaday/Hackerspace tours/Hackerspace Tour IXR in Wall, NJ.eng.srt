00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,560
a retired engineer and this was a place

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,599
for me to come and meet other people who

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,269
like to build things good ok this is the

12
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,000
workshop area we have our toolbox drill

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,210
press break we have compound miter saw

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,840
are a variety of tools from metalworking

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,469
or people that are building projects ok

16
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,590
this is an oscilloscope it's ancient but

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,530
it still works it's not a fancy digital

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,420
one like the new ones but if you don't

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,010
have a sculpt and you need it it'll work

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,710
very nicely you also have the 22 36

21
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,030
that's a little bit newer one and below

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,979
that you have the shape oco-2 yose what

23
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,560
this is right ok ok this is our where

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,689
our members leave their stuff during the

25
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,369
week if they don't want to cart stuff

26
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,369
back and forth every week they can get a

27
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,000
bin and leave their projects in the bin

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,439
our members are doing a variety of

29
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,220
