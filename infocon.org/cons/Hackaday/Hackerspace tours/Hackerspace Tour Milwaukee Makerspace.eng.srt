00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,979
hi my name is Michelle and welcome to

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,440
the Milwaukee makerspace we are located

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,629
in a 16,000 square foot facility in Bay

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,849
View neighborhood of Milwaukee Milwaukee

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:09,929
Wisconsin

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,530
I met part of Milwaukee makerspace for

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,020
about two years now and I kind of

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,250
started up the old building and I'm

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,900
working myself from the new building and

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,949
really excited about it

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,080
my name's Brianna Holman I'm the current

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,529
president just got reelected so looking

13
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,240
forward to another year or so of all

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,670
this fun stuff this is the entrance to

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,000
the Milwaukee makerspace we got the

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,570
craft lab over here we do chain mail

17
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,600
sewing projects get a lot of the cleaner

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,129
crafts stuff there it's kind of a nice

19
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,719
entrance there a place to hang out I

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,879
think you got a little shrine here -

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,610
you're like The Wall of Fame a lot of

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,430
the laser cut laser cut work that's been

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,410
done in the laser room right there our

24
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,539
power wheels metals and some of the some

25
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,699
of the cars that are pieces of cars that

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,680
have survived from different cars you

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,210
race in the in the parwans racing series

28
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,049
if you look at that that uh this license

29
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,640
plate right here that's actually wood I

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,259
was reading the laser cutter room and

31
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,020
painted by a by Shane and we actually

32
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,150
used it in one of our cars that's nice

33
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,310
and these are teams of the events right

34
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,659
here yeah these are teams I think this

35
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,159
sort of first year about four years ago

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,820
I believe in Detroit yeah and it's it's

37
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,439
come a long ways since cars got a lot a

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,960
lot faster and these are some of the

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,280
different cars that that we have

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,570
competed with over the years

41
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,909
nice this is our laser cutter room we

42
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,540
have three laser cutters in here of all

43
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,920
two of them are operational right now

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,079
this is a 60 watt and 35 watt alright so

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,770
that's a 25 135 watt and this gets a lot

46
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,380
of years it's probably the most most

47
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,210
used equipment I would say except the

48
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,030
woodshop at the space and we also have a

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,690
little bit

50
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,850
you ever hear that rarely gets used what

51
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,530
can be used to make start divorce

52
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,119
we usually chemically etch most of us

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,910
record or split if you wanted to if

54
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,200
somebody wants to do it they can do it

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:22,980
right here nice what we call our a

56
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,050
stream this is our remember storage area

57
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,520
we have as like different different

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,950
places to sort your projects we have

59
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,050
full pallets we have half pelt you can

60
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,880
rent out floor space and then our famous

61
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,590
hack rack we got here all the stuff

62
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,840
people donate you can hack it apart use

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,650
it thank you what you want I just

64
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,170
noticed this this automatic door closing

65
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,060
mechanism is a hack itself it's just a

66
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,020
couple of big washers or those and

67
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,480
they've got it on some pulleys so that

68
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,700
when the door opens the raises the

69
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,010
washers up and closes itself that's the

70
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,280
nerdy journey that we had at Maker fest

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,690
well it's it's a concept that started

72
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,959
Maker Faire New York where they have

73
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,640
adult version of a pinewood Jersey where

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,830
you have a track and there's no limits

75
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,209
except it's it can't be too dangerous

76
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,300
right and so it's it's a version of that

77
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,040
that they posted the plans for maker for

78
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,570
New York and we made a track here for

79
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,370
our maker fest which is something

80
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,989
somewhere I Maker Faire we had here put

81
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,430
the previous week weekend that's what

82
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,390
the place was so clean so this is a 18

83
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,430
foot sailboat that Willy one of our

84
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,220
members is making the only thing he got

85
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,730
part of this kit was these ribs and the

86
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,630
rest he's hand carving and hand making

87
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,519
into what will eventually be about 18

88
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,870
foot sailboat in two years wow it's a

89
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,590
big project who is a big man so is this

90
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,560
this year's yeah entries yep these are

91
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,420
two of the three cars that we competed

92
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,670
in with this year Red Lotus in a big

93
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,120
Jake's van and we're gonna do some work

94
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,190
on this we can race it again next year

95
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,870
on this one we think it's been retired

96
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,330
it's it's just gone through so many

97
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,830
fixes we can't even recognize the

98
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,599
original thing

99
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,399
and the third one he's talking about the

100
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,108
one that I built I ended up jumping it

101
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:21,259
and destroying it objective about six

102
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,150
feet no and it just completely

103
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,000
obliterated sounds song Volterra this is

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,110
where members to store stuff in locked

105
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:36,250
volts we have think about was a 19 volts

106
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,340
what's the very large array of phones

107
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,590
exactly what it is for the large piece

108
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,990
on the wall yeah yeah come this over

109
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,780
you're very proud of our five axis

110
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:53,120
Cooper robot whoa look at that thing how

111
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,490
old is this I would say 15 years so it

112
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,160
looks like it's got a spindle motor and

113
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,199
it's got a running water on or unrushed

114
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,349
have you routed anything with it we have

115
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:07,070
Wow

116
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,349
what is what drives it and how do you

117
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:12,110
program its we have a few members here

118
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,669
that are just getting acquainted with it

119
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,800
so we're hoping that as soon as they

120
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,910
figure out how to use it properly

121
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,949
they're gonna teach the rest of us you

122
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,570
can see over by the whiteboard there we

123
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:30,190
have some stuff that was routed yeah so

124
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,870
Personals working on that cuca also does

125
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,699
a lot of scenes that's his own cnc

126
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,220
machines so and he wants to do full

127
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,169
statues on the cuca so that's one of his

128
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:41,000
motivations behind getting that up and

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,250
running and the thing is fast it can

130
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,430
move about 180 degrees in one second so

131
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,509
that's what we had to build this giant

132
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:50,300
enclosure to make sure you know everyone

133
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,130
stays safe we can control it right but

134
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,849
we're not professional CNCs so have one

135
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:59,719
wrong g-code yes there's a big room that

136
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:02,810
they built up for people not safe but

137
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,789
what it contains some of the dust too

138
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:06,259
that's obviously an issue if you're

139
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:07,909
doing a lot of work real quick and then

140
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,099
it's always good to have you know

141
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:11,900
something around it in case a a bit

142
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,520
breaks or something else goes flying off

143
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,150
so we've kind of done it separated in

144
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,120
metal shop wood shop garage area so a

145
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,620
lot of the tools that we have here

146
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,450
we've got the similar version its

147
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,120
counterpart over in the woodshop 48 inch

148
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,500
metal break

149
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,800
bending metal sheet metal some

150
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,270
miscellaneous buy our stock and stuff

151
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,760
some tools we have a huge 18-inch disc

152
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,550
sander which is awesome because a lot of

153
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,930
the tools over here people have taken

154
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,450
variable speed motor drives and they've

155
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,000
actually added switches so it's

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,130
infinitely variable speed you don't have

157
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,170
to change belts or play with anything

158
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,870
just walk up and play with it which is

159
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,250
really great especially for people that

160
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,700
are real familiar with machine tools

161
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,020
some very large drill presses that we

162
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,000
haven't had a lot of use for you know

163
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,350
not a lot of plate steel that's one inch

164
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,990
thick we need to drill through but it

165
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,770
makes a good table we've got this mill

166
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,900
that one of our members is working on

167
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,890
we're hoping to see and see it

168
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,200
eventually we haven't done it yet but

169
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,810
it's a nice five axis Bridgeport

170
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,140
miscellaneous hardware storage over here

171
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,240
yeah we actually there was an Ace

172
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,120
Hardware that went out of business and

173
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,470
we got to the point where we're stopping

174
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,000
in there once every couple days until

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,670
they finally closed everything out and

176
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,140
we kept asking them you know bogging

177
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,270
them hey can be buying too hard where

178
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,860
can we buy any fixtures can we buy

179
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,870
anything else and finally the weekend

180
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,670
came where they were cleaning up and at

181
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,420
first they didn't let us buy the actual

182
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,390
racks and drawers they wanted to keep

183
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,590
that and sent to another store where

184
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,750
they can use it and about halfway

185
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,250
through bagging everything up and

186
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,480
labeling it they're like oh I'll show

187
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,970
you those and so you said this is gonna

188
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,960
be a huge CNC build right here he said

189
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,640
router so your router router right here

190
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,410
so fight so we can take a commercial

191
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,310
plywood sheet from store and now put it

192
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,530
down here and mail it all from all so it

193
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,900
fits right on them on the bed right on

194
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,870
the bed and I have a banking system

195
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,690
holders sheet oh yeah Wow how long you

196
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,010
think it'll take to complete this bill

197
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,000
two months two months Wow fantastic and

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,910
huge welding setup over here yeah to

199
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,490
recognize the red screens so you've got

200
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,220
compressed air built in yep there's a

201
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,080
compressor in another room or is it the

202
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,570
one the bolts oh and a vault mx4 can

203
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:46,640
also have a casting first boy those are

204
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,270
some big wind chimes right there all

205
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,640
right so more as a compressed air and

206
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,710
this is into the woodshop now this so

207
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,160
until the workshop tables are right here

208
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,660
and around the corner up here we have a

209
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,880
right now it's en to your honor that we

210
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,250
use right now for a fitting foam and

211
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,590
wood and actually even making circuit

212
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,540
boards it's a career now it's got about

213
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,440
24 foot by 32 inch cutting surface and

214
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,780
this uses Mach 3 as a controlling

215
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,660
mechanism for it and this is pretty much

216
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,570
home built the base is out of a hold

217
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:26,150
laser cutter entry and then up there

218
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,590
this is just a carbon fiber tube

219
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,790
spanning the whole

220
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,449
the CNC router just moves in Z

221
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:35,240
directions so just needs to be rigid do

222
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,000
you have any dust control in your we do

223
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,100
as of Wow let me have a dust control in

224
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,750
here it got really dusty especially with

225
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,610
the enclosed space so yeah it looks

226
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,949
pretty clean for a woodshop I'm good job

227
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:51,160
on that

228
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,990
Oh check that out it's like giant store

229
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,370
giant panel cutter that was actually a

230
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,810
flower that purchased a bunch of people

231
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,730
got together found on Craigslist and

232
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,980
said you know hey you want to throw 20

233
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,870
30 50 100 bucks at it and the money

234
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,389
people did I think it was like 450 475

235
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:10,490
yeah in general this is your meeting

236
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,250
room and social area yeah it's it's

237
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,110
basically like the central hub where

238
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,910
everybody comes and goes it gets

239
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,620
vacuumed it pretty frequently because of

240
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,160
that Tuesday night seven o'clock we open

241
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,449
up to the public we have people come in

242
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:25,790
here and we'll sit around lately

243
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,170
meetings have been anywhere from 30 to

244
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,260
40 people we've had as many as 70 and

245
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,360
then it kind of transitions onto your

246
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,760
electronics area you get a ton of spools

247
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,060
here oh this is leader reels of this

248
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,260
surface-mount stuff yeah yeah and boy

249
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,910
once I did my first circuit mount our

250
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,260
servers my board I didn't want to go

251
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,050
back I know I'm so nice but at the same

252
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,839
time it's such a pain are these easier

253
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,550
donated yeah actually

254
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,139
most of the electronics lab came from

255
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:55,040
one man who had a lot of contacts with

256
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,370
electronics manufacturers and also used

257
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,839
to live in Texas Instruments he does

258
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,959
computer recycling or used to but he

259
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,459
would just basically find something and

260
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,579
just start collecting it we've just

261
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,410
recently reorganized this like last

262
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,319
couple of weeks and cleaned some stuff

263
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:13,519
up so we've sorted out the test

264
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,260
equipment a lot of the connectors and

265
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,910
fasteners

266
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,100
tools we finally put a piece of pegboard

267
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,660
up here which honestly I don't know how

268
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,850
we survived without it but then we've

269
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,560
got things like the the heating presses

270
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,449
for we're making a circuit board with

271
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:28,670
the transfer paper or if you're doing

272
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,709
surface mount stuff we've got some drill

273
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:33,589
machines and then also a electric walk

274
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,110
which the electric walk the toaster oven

275
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,819
goes those work pretty good actually for

276
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:39,880
surface mount stuff

277
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,519
tons and tons of components

278
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,290
most of that stuff are there's diodes

279
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,589
transistors and integrated chips and

280
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:49,930
then over here the top row is nothing

281
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,589
but resistors and then the red is

282
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,420
capacitors then everything else is just

283
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,220
kind of a mishmash I thought when we

284
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,230
walked by rajulun is that a 3d printing

285
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,209
lab we have quite a few 3d printers we

286
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:02,760
do as far as this which is nice

287
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,860
Wow one of our members is uh fixing that

288
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,910
up and he actually was making this I

289
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,940
think during Baker Fest which I'm not

290
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,410
sure I'd want to drink out of that but

291
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,910
uh it's still pretty cool

292
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:23,500
see he had a replicator one right here

293
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,399
mm-hmm

294
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,149
I didn't have to laughs I forget what

295
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:30,339
space it was but I was watching one of

296
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:33,430
the videos and they had a replicator and

297
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,980
walked by camera pan and it said use

298
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,870
only left extruder and started laughing

299
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,680
like yeah yeah that happens sometimes

300
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,089
which one is this right here is this a

301
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:47,500
oh jeez what is that that's uh that's I

302
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,820
know whose it is I just don't know what

303
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,370
it is

304
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,540
although lulzbot it's actually got the

305
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,640
sign in front of it oh yeah there it is

306
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,829
yeah Matt hasn't trained people on that

307
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:58,480
yet but he's been working on it and then

308
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,399
this looks like a home brew yeah there's

309
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,740
one of our other members mark he's

310
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,329
actually doing a lot of really big

311
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:06,610
prints on that that's a large printer

312
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,680
right there yeah he's made some like

313
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,220
he's a fractal looking Voss's has he got

314
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,149
any it's called the mega max down there

315
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:18,070
but no I was looking for his actual

316
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,290
finished print he's basically had at

317
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,760
least some of these things these little

318
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,329
shapes but this would be like 1/10 of

319
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:27,040
what he's done like he's gone to the

320
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
point where it's like stretched out so

321
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,160
the diameters about this big and it's

322
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,870
the all foot tall oh wow

323
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,339
so he was doing was the other night and

324
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:34,540
it took him I think about eight hours to

325
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,839
print
