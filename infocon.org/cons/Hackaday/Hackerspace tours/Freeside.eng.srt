1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,819
this is caleb we're here in Atlanta

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,130
Georgia with Stephen Sutton at freeside

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,440
Atlanta Stevens going to give us a tour

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,070
real quick and let's get started okay so

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,789
this is the Welcome area free sighs we

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,820
asking all of our all of our new people

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,320
signed waivers and we've got waivers

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,750
information a sign-in desk to get on the

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,099
mailing list and the beat up information

10
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,320
we use meet after class management

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,560
secret signs there this is our 3d

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,340
printing area so we have a maker coffee

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,920
cup caper and we've got one that's sort

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,410
of happy we also have an egg box which

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,590
is pretty cool I actually laid out some

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,000
of the some of the things that you've

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,850
printed so far so we also have a powder

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,370
printer in the back and two of our

19
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,260
members recently got published in a

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,510
medical journal because one of our

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,699
members is a surgeon and so he was

22
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,370
basically taking 3d scans of people's

23
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,250
feet and printing the mouse for

24
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,670
basically pre-surgery planning so that's

25
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,689
pretty cool we're pretty proud of that

26
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,439
you can find out about that on her blog

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,040
here we've got a tracker so right now

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,450
from the process of building

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,700
building desks and sort of building out

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,579
this area anytime we sort of do our

31
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,159
basic meetings this is our hexacopter

32
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,710
UAV for about three quarters of the way

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,840
through building that we accidentally

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,539
let out the magic smoke on the receiver

35
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,649
last week so we're going to be working

36
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,369
on rebuilding that but we do a lot of

37
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,490
classes here we entrepreneurship and

38
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,340
meetups for artists 3d printing and CNC

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,049
and all kinds of stuff so very pretty

40
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,770
cool we've got a biochemistry lab over

41
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,349
here one of our former members was way

42
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,200
way into it and he donated all of his

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,450
stuff we really aren't using it right

44
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,539
now but we may get back into it we've

45
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,099
got one member that's interested in

46
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,569
building a greenhouse so we may be

47
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:03,000
building a greenhouse and experimenting

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,159
with aquaculture is well it's cooling

49
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,899
stuff like that here pretty soon very

50
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,038
cool we got a sort of your basic library

51
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,829
this is our server so we have a server

52
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,680
that's running the RFID entry system we

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,280
have another server that's running a

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,900
basically BN to our virtualization

55
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,880
server so we use that for some of the

56
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,910
classes and I do machine learning so we

57
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,489
also serve a octave vm for that kind of

58
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:35,519
research and then we've got sort of we

59
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,799
get a lot of computer donations we've

60
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,150
been sorting through them and deciding

61
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,799
what's good and what's not and so this

62
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,989
is sort of our our rack right now we're

63
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,799
working on thinning out the herd ok so

64
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,500
you step into here this is our shared

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,810
workspace so right now we got a bunch of

66
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,900
guys hacking around on what it what is

67
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,290
this this is a trophyless networks 5110

68
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,599
wireless mesh router that's used for

69
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,870
like large-scale fetch routing it's got

70
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,329
these uh ridiculous antennas yeah we're

71
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:11,669
trying to figure it out so you want two

72
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:13,230
minutes to make it configurable I guess

73
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,389
somebody one time donated a couple of

74
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:16,950
them and nobody knows where they came

75
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,519
from or what so we're just trying to

76
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,319
figure it out maybe we can make a nice

77
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,840
little mission appointment type our

78
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,709
central base station here and then

79
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,159
deploy work from there we go just label

80
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,409
as our as our electronics workspace so

81
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:33,540
we've got two oscilloscope set up and we

82
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,000
can sort of expand it to other areas

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,670
that we need to we've got all the basic

84
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,439
electronics components and footman over

85
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,060
here and then we've got the project

86
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,220
storage over there so people can sort of

87
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,870
hack around on something work on it a

88
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,230
little bit put it up first we got a

89
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,849
couple of pieces of equipment we might

90
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:52,500
be hacking around on here pretty soon

91
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,739
too

92
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,730
this is sort of our office area we've

93
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,319
got our printer and everything pretty

94
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,510
boring this camp he's working right now

95
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,200
civilization we got a small kitchen

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,959
which comes in really useful we've also

97
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,760
got a kegerator which also comes in

98
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,969
really oh yeah in the in the back we've

99
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:14,620
got our first of three cleaning areas

100
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,079
and a bathroom code machine refrigerator

101
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,839
sort of all your standard stuff so

102
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,560
seduce yep so this this area is pretty

103
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,750
interesting what we do with this is this

104
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,449
is basically this is basically shared

105
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:30,759
storage so if you have a project that

106
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,020
you're working on and you need a piece

107
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,930
or a cable or a specific AC adapter that

108
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,370
you want to hack around them oh yeah you

109
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,449
can actually pick up any of the

110
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,039
components we have a huge amount of

111
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,259
components here and a lot of different

112
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:49,449
cool pieces of tech to take apart just a

113
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:52,090
simple hack around on so this is this is

114
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,389
really really useful in here we've got

115
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:58,210
our meeting area this is the pterodactyl

116
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,139
of course that's nice did you guys make

117
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:11,380
that I assume plans cut it out hung it

118
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,720
up so it was actually really cheap to

119
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,389
build we've actually got three CNC Mills

120
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,330
on the way to desktop mills and then

121
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,710
we're designing and building a full-size

122
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,710
milk from the ground up oh cool but we

123
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,229
had one it broke and so we're between

124
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,520
C&C mills right now so this is our back

125
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,039
area very Paul we got all of our

126
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,630
personal protective equipment so anybody

127
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,880
that walks into the back shop needs to

128
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,250
equip themselves accordingly so we've

129
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,050
got glasses

130
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,940
is in dust masks and I wash and fire

131
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,039
extinguishers and hard hats and gloves

132
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,990
and earplugs and all kinds of stuff so

133
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,990
we're really trying to lock down the

134
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,610
safety thing over here that's right

135
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,150
these are our main cabinets so we're

136
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,210
working on hacking these around and

137
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,120
adding a little arcade fun to the place

138
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,590
one of our members donated both of them

139
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,690
we may actually keep shinobi oh it's

140
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,060
gonna sue and then back around on a

141
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,949
shadow warriors are doing the verdict so

142
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:12,000
far yep I could see that ah so in here

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,729
we've got our crafts to you we got a lot

144
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:15,960
of square footage here and we've got a

145
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,940
lot of stuff in it so come spoon it's

146
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,190
actually it's a lot of fun to mess

147
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,960
around with the different things we have

148
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,460
available but this is the crafts video

149
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,530
it's still kind of messy we've been

150
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,169
working on cleaning it up but there's so

151
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,460
much going on here it's hard to decide

152
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,379
what should go where how we should

153
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,969
organize it so we're sort of working on

154
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:36,990
that ah over here we've got paint

155
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,639
storage and different kinds of spray

156
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,729
paint another cleaning area and this was

157
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,969
a photo lab in the back but the member

158
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,919
that was doing that left so we're

159
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,690
deciding whether or not we want to still

160
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,849
do that or maybe will repurpose it yeah

161
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:00,270
upstairs we actually have a loft we're

162
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,009
working on building that out it hasn't

163
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:03,840
been a really high priority right now

164
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,789
we've been working on cleaning things up

165
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:08,219
and finding the right equipment and sort

166
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,500
of recycling what we don't need it's in

167
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,740
there it has a really cool open window

168
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,969
that we've designed that looks down on

169
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:17,250
the shop but it's taken a little longer

170
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,900
to build out we gotta run electrical

171
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,919
thing back here is our workshop and

172
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,289
we're really proud of the amount of work

173
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:26,819
put into this in the last couple weeks

174
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,979
we've got all the hardware organized

175
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,610
we've got all the old stuff for painting

176
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,229
all the extra tools that you need for

177
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:36,569
painting we got lots and lots of sauce

178
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,699
and working equipment we actually had a

179
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,029
whole wood shop there you so we're

180
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,039
working on setting that up and doing

181
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,020
classes to train people on how to use it

182
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,789
and what the proper way to use it is and

183
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:50,729
that kind of stuff back here we've got

184
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:58,439
our cool shop so we have anything you

185
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,740
could possibly need to work on something

186
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,689
as far as small hand tools a lot of our

187
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,789
bigger equipment is next door we've got

188
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,559
our welders over there and they have a

189
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:09,180
full cnc router and that kind of thing

190
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,339
but for the most part for small hand

191
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:14,039
tools this is this is the place we got a

192
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,110
lot of work space dude we're working on

193
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,369
sorting out we had a lot of donations of

194
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:21,749
hand tools and electric tools and stuff

195
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:24,959
like that these are all good so we have

196
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,339
been sorting them out wearing a label

197
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,139
and fill up that jewelry of a little

198
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:32,789
more character over here is the 3d

199
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,179
printer that one of our members got

200
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,458
published in a medical journal doing

201
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,269
research on basically printing models of

202
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:44,970
people's feet for pre-surgery planning

203
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,970
so this is a powder printer you've got a

204
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,920
reservoir of powder that indexes up as

205
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,680
the peace index is down and it basically

206
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,920
sprays binder and layers and build the

207
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,029
piece from the ground up and you just

208
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:59,610
pull it out shake the dust off that's

209
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,430
cool this is this is really

210
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,670
pretty expensive stuff we go to a drill

211
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,920
press and a jig saws and grinders and

212
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,720
stuff like that but honestly a lot of

213
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,610
that stuff we haven't arranged in a

214
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,620
functional way so that's one of the ways

215
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,839
one of the way we've got to improve the

216
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:17,300
space for working on this is most of the

217
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,620
woodshop that we've got tucked in the

218
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,420
back so we need to sort of figure out

219
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,580
what to do with this area find a way to

220
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,770
make functional and keep it clean yeah

221
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,230
because what can happen or what has

222
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,910
happened in the past is if you don't lay

223
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,920
out an area functionally then stuff just

224
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,870
gets piled up because it doesn't make

225
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,420
sense where projects you go yep you have

226
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,700
a foosball table if you want one haha I

227
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,790
don't think we have space for one okay

228
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,640
the kids like it though this is a bunch

229
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,529
of glass that we got donated for a

230
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:47,870
greenhouse that might be happening which

231
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,300
is pretty cool these are all the getting

232
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,670
the stuff out of here shelves so this

233
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,680
stuff is all going in a month like I

234
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,300
said we've got a lot of donations and we

235
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,190
really do appreciate it but some of the

236
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,110
stuff we really we can't use especially

237
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,959
one of the biggest problems is CRT

238
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,240
monitors or they can't even be expensive

239
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,380
yeah so we we like donations that some

240
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,970
of this stuff is just for people to pick

241
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,580
up kiss it may be a good idea for a fun

242
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,070
project but we can use it right now we

243
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,480
pulled out the washer and dryer to make

244
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,670
make rings of Chris of renovation so

245
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,790
we're

246
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:27,569
this is we've got a full size lathe to

247
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:31,829
that works but we're all a little too

248
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,810
scared to plug it in right now we got

249
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,850
one guy who is certified in using that

250
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,139
kind of heavy equipment but most

251
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:38,910
everybody isn't so for safety reasons

252
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,040
we're leaving it unhooked right now

253
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,499
understandable yeah we got a couple that

254
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:45,629
air compressors you know full-size grill

255
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:47,839
and a shout fan and that kind of stuff

256
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,189
we have a full-size kiln problems on the

257
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:54,779
bottom side so we're working on fixing

258
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,360
that but this could be really useful we

259
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,949
have a pottery wheel up front I didn't

260
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,329
go over it but there's a lot of

261
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:03,629
equipment i glossed over up there so we

262
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,189
could have sort of a pottery or perhaps

263
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:10,620
this is all basic you know mechanical

264
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,990
equipment wrenches and tools in that

265
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,240
kind stuff and then of course we got our

266
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,819
emergency eyewash station flammables

267
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:19,709
cabinet and that kind of stuff so we

268
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:22,550
actually have a team that's working on

269
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,259
24 hours of lemons and so it's basically

270
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,069
a takeoff of 24 hours of the lawn at

271
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:31,199
road atlanta but you're only supposed to

272
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,490
pay five hundred dollars in your car so

273
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,290
your basis basically supposed to race a

274
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,319
lemon four burners so we actually got a

275
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,600
mercedes benz that we picked up the

276
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,620
cloud nine bucks so we're going to be

277
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,319
the one percent so this is all their

278
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:45,300
work we're ready cool so it gets kind of

279
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,040
fun

280
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,900
so that's basically it all right how

281
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,370
long have you how long have you guys

282
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,220
been here ah it's gonna have tears yeah

283
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,560
and we've we've been renovating for

284
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,240
probably about three months and you have

285
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,620
any idea how many members you have right

286
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,630
now right now we have about 35 that's

287
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,140
great yeah so the this place is pretty

288
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,420
pretty cheap to maintain so we're

289
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,740
working on building the membership up

290
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,260
and it's pretty cheap to be very good so

291
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,580
we're working on lowering news right now

292
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,150
from 80 to 60 bucks cool well thank you

293
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,480
very much

294
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,650
Oh
