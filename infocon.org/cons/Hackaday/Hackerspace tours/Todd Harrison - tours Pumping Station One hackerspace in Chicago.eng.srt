1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
I

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,299
the door is marked okay we bring brought

3
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:12,039
into plumbing station number one by

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:14,410
sunshine she's off camera but we're

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,940
gonna get a little toward real quick to

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,060
somebody else right okay let's go walk

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,650
this way okay this is cool how long has

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,360
this been here about a year

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,230
go straight

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,469
the kitchen and oh man they got a lot of

11
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,860
stuff back here which will seduce all

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,020
this and just put these walls up so they

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,530
have a little kitchen area okay okay so

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,780
this is mostly going to be a the gut

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,820
routing tables and stuff here huh where

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,129
I better not turn so fast so you've got

17
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,159
an epilogue of epilogue laser okay

18
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:07,100
wow they got a break in a very large

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:14,729
very very large band saw old school some

20
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:22,979
machine tools some lathes mini lathe

21
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,320
mini mini lathe oh that looks familiar

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,930
we have one of those that are half your

23
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,310
space wow this place is just packed

24
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,080
chopping log this must be the welding

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,890
section and then we're going to go

26
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,509
upstairs so you go through this all the

27
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,050
way

28
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,580
there's a QR that you are tagged so

29
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,050
we'll go upstairs and check it out so

30
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,950
this is the upstairs

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,670
they say this is storage but looks like

32
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,210
a loft area that has lots of storage so

33
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,619
it's kind of dark for the camera here

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,880
they obviously this is from their

35
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,709
scanning microscope I saw that earlier

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,040
wow this is interesting they get their

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,800
real resistor code up there what we

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,480
cookin they got some more artwork here

39
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,390
fascinating and then this is the arts

40
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,709
and crafts area on the second floor will

41
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,870
they have some sewing machine several

42
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,170
several sewing machines over there a big

43
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,480
table here with some vinyl cutters I

44
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,730
heard and some the do arts and crafts

45
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,440
cutting here everything is mostly

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,570
Tuesday night they have some 3d printers

47
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:54,780
here it looks like yeah okay and then

48
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,890
there's the MakerBot and I think that's

49
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,340
the line cutter interesting work they

50
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,739
can do here there's a large HP printer I

51
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,799
think it's HP I'm just guessing no it's

52
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,269
not yeah it's a big HP printer so that's

53
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,040
where they keep most of the stuff here

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,010
on second floor and butt over here is

55
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,079
where they do the electronics they have

56
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,760
a delta robot over here and it crates

57
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,079
and crates and crates of stuff for them

58
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,060
to work on looks like they're in the

59
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,799
midst of tearing down their Delta or a

60
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,329
lot I'll turn on you yay they're working

61
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,950
on another type of I beam extruded

62
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,100
aluminum i-beam probably MakerBot kind

63
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,459
of style

64
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:54,260
this delta's roll stock max okay and

65
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,820
this is where they do our dueno classes

66
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,320
and other microcontrollers and

67
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,550
electronics still second floor bins and

68
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,040
bins and bins of tools it's a very

69
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,870
interesting layout with lots of folding

70
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,500
table space and tablespace a drill some

71
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,140
computers over here oops the Sun is

72
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:19,719
messing up the camera let's see we got

73
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,640
CMOS trim check some air I've got a

74
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,730
couple of old Silla scopes at 45 for ASL

75
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,580
scope tektronix 224 45 another old

76
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,270
tektronix

77
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,699
you don't recall we did that huh okay

78
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,680
and then we have a meeting space where

79
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,440
it looks like they play music and over

80
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,180
here at the front window they actually

81
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,500
have a bottom so both a full-service bar

82
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,110
here that pumping station and Roma cool

83
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,340
yeah what's like the front door has a

84
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,280
little information above the back door

85
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,409
so if you're the last person leading

86
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:04,150
you'll know the back door is open that

87
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,379
they took the letters or program that's

88
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:07,690
right now but more interestingly in this

89
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,120
little box is a tool job yay so if you

90
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,469
brought out some tools and you need to

91
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:12,879
send them back and no one's here you can

92
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,190
drop off you can drop off the tools that

93
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,789
you took home
