1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
alright if you could tell us a little

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,740
bit about this project okay I've been

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,020
studying patient safety as one of the

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,800
things i do at work and I study mistake

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,170
proofing there's a problem in medicine

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,269
which is that about 100,000 people a

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,090
year die from infections if they're

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,010
getting hospitals and a lot of that they

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,109
think is associated with hand hygiene

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,090
people watching their hands so this is a

11
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,460
mistake proofing devices a tollgate to

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,109
make sure that people wash their hands

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,210
before they enter a room this was

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,420
originally built in the hospital told

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,489
Metro West in framingham massachusetts i

16
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,410
tried to copy it and refine it a little

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,379
and so the idea is that when you walk up

18
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,329
to a patient room this bar will be in

19
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,219
front of the door when you wash your

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,399
hands the gate comes open there's a

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,309
motion or rangefinder here that will

22
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,460
detect if you're in the way so hopefully

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,219
it won't hit people when you're done you

24
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,070
walk through the door and one sense is

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,860
that there's nothing there it lowers it

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,840
lowers it slow so that if there is

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,060
somebody there won't startle them in

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,180
kirkland perfect and what is driving

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,360
this what do you have in there we have a

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,270
really big counterweight it's attached

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,850
to a servo motor that will raise and

32
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,860
lower the gate which is then hooked to a

33
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,710
breadboard that has an at- on there

34
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,869
which is essentially in arduino without

35
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,140
all the communication overhead and then

36
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,799
we have we've hacked each of the two

37
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,439
hand sanitizers so that when they go off

38
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,689
it sends three volts into the Arduino

39
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,850
telling it to raise the gate we then

40
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,329
have a rangefinder right down here that

41
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,580
also speaks to the Arduino

42
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,740
it doesn't lower it until we coast is

43
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,110
clear very cool thank you very much

44
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,740
thank you
