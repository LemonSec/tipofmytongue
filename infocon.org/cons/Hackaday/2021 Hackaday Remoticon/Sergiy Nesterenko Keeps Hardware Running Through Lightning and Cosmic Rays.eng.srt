1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,440
uh welcome back to remote con our next

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,639
speaker uh he currently runs a startup

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,759
that makes

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,920
uh pcbs using physics driven generative

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,680
design before that he worked in the

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,560
avionics group at spacex specializing in

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,800
the effects of ionizing radiation on

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,880
electronics design

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,480
so he knows how hard it is to design

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,640
space rated electronics and how the

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,240
physics of space flight will do its best

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,079
to kill your circuits

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,399
please welcome sergey nestorenko

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,079
all right thank you so much for the

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,239
intro dan

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,520
let me get my screen chair set up here

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,600
all right um thanks everyone for joining

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,520
the talk uh i want to talk a little bit

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,360
about a few of the many things that can

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,280
kill you when you go to space as dan

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,039
alluded to earlier

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,879
there are many many things that can i'll

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,199
only cover a few and i'll cover them

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,640
very very briefly

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,160
um so this is just meant as a quick

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,000
introduction and kind of a bit of fun

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and not really a full treatise on the

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
subject

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,320
um so as dan mentioned uh my background

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,960
um so before uh kind of in the last five

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,760
years i spent uh at the americas group

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,080
at spacex specifically i started out in

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,320
the electromagnetic interference team

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,759
uh and then switched over to the

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,520
ionizing radiation team basically

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,960
finding different ways to break

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,560
electronics

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,119
i wanted to show this kind of uh picture

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,079
here because it's the first flight of

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,759
falcon heavy which was also the first

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,920
time we dipped uh the second stage of

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
falcon 9 or falcon heavy into the van

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
allen belts it's been quite a few years

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,680
not just myself of course large team

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,960
preparing for this that was a big

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,320
milestone for us

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,759
um separately

48
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,360
i currently run a startup that uses um

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,720
that's trying to make a physics aware

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,880
pcb compiler um we're hiring if

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,159
anybody's interested in talking to me

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,399
about that please find me afterwards

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,920
but for now let's get going to talk

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,240
about space

55
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,280
um so a quick disclaimer space is hard

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,759
uh and as the first chart shows here it

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,600
really is true that how much you learn

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,439
about in high school or even starting a

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,000
real job at nasa or spacex is limited

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and when you start playing kerbal space

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,080
program you learn even more and that's

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,440
about how seriously you should take

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,720
everything i say

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
um you know with every every one of

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,160
these topics there are

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,640
teams of researchers at universities and

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,959
companies uh studying these in detail

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,200
for decades and i couldn't even compose

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,440
to touching that depth of expertise so

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,040
uh if any of this information is

71
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,200
actually relevant to you go further and

72
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,720
do some more research

73
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,800
and uh another plug kerbal space program

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,480
is awesome if you like space stuff check

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
it out

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,959
so here's a few of the topics that we'll

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,360
cover uh everything from environmental

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
effects like lightning and humidity uh

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,160
to things like radiation and heat

80
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,800
re-entry plasma tin whiskers

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
so without further ado let's dive into

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,640
these

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,720
so the first um

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,080
effect that i'd like to talk about is

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
effective lighting

86
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,599
i kind of basically put all of these in

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,599
chronological order of the life of a

88
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,760
spacecraft and uh one of the first

89
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,239
dangers that shows up when you put your

90
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,159
spacecraft your uh rocket and your

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,560
satellite on the pad is lightning

92
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,599
um so

93
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,680
lighting is pretty common unfortunately

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,959
we have to really think about it and

95
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,280
deal with it um there's basically two

96
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,640
ways that can impact your spacecraft

97
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,720
in the first image here what we have is

98
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,159
a image of falcon 9 standing at 640

99
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,519
where we actually have thankfully

100
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,959
lightning towers so these lightning

101
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,080
towers are basically meant to be

102
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,440
conductors that are bigger than the

103
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,519
rocket itself so if lightning were to

104
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,959
strike it doesn't strike the vehicle

105
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,920
directly but rather strikes the towers

106
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,599
but that doesn't eliminate all of the

107
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,000
problems as you might imagine there's

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,519
quite a bit of current going through

109
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,680
that lightning bolt uh which creates a

110
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,280
very large magnetic field which can then

111
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,640
induce a whole bunch of other currents

112
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,879
in your vehicle itself um so despite it

113
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,319
not being a direct attachment you still

114
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,040
have to think quite a bit about how your

115
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,879
you know the current will show up in

116
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,680
your

117
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
long connectors that connect your brow

118
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,560
support equipment and what that will do

119
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
for the rest of your electronics

120
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
um the second image here is even crazier

121
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
it is a direct strike

122
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,480
of lightning onto a soyuz launch

123
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,760
that occurred

124
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
which is also not horribly uncommon

125
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,199
so this happy to say that both of these

126
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,600
launches survived and went on to do

127
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
their missions and deploy their payloads

128
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,880
without a problem which is a testament

129
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,360
to many engineers who made that possible

130
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,400
um

131
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,639
another fun story here is from apollo 12

132
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,800
which was struck by lightning on ascent

133
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,479
twice no less

134
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,880
um and set off all sorts of alarms on

135
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,120
their ascent uh but thankfully they did

136
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
not pull in a board switch and realize

137
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
that they could switch their uh signal

138
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
conditioning equipment and restore all

139
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,880
their uh alarms and keep flying

140
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,360
um so as i kind of mentioned

141
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
unfortunately some of the places we like

142
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,720
to launch from are

143
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
places where a lot of lighting happens

144
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,720
cape canaveral and spacex starbase are

145
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,880
in some of the highest lightning dense

146
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,840
regions in the country uh vandenberg is

147
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,280
not but vandenberg unfortunately does

148
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
not do a lot of launches compared to

149
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,960
cape canaveral um

150
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,759
and the reason for this is uh that we

151
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,800
want to be as far south as we can uh to

152
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,479
launch and we also want to launch

153
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,800
eastward in most cases because that's

154
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,639
the rotation of that's the direction

155
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,479
which earth rotates and we get a little

156
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,160
bit of boost from that that makes it a

157
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
little bit easier to get to orbit

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
so um

159
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,199
this is kind of a conflict of interest

160
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,560
but that's why we have to deal with it

161
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
we can't just put the launch pad

162
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,280
somewhere where lightning is less of a

163
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,280
problem

164
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,800
um so on the right here we see kind of

165
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,039
the shape the electrical shape of a

166
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,880
lightning strike um so the peak

167
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,080
amplitude of a lightning strike can be

168
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,280
as high as 200 kiloamps which is a lot

169
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,360
uh and at a pretty fast rise time on the

170
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
order of hundreds of microseconds um so

171
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,919
obviously that is uh if you actually

172
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,039
have to deal with a direct attachment

173
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,639
that is an insane amount of current to

174
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,800
put up with uh but even if it's not a

175
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,120
direct attachment the fields around a

176
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,520
lightning bolt can also be pretty crazy

177
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
so what we do in the aerospace industry

178
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
to prepare for this is a whole bunch of

179
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,600
mills uh a whole bunch of standardized

180
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,560
testing

181
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,240
there's a whole bunch of tests called

182
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,400
the mil standard tests that prepare for

183
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,639
all sorts of things not just lightning

184
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,080
but on the bottom left here we have an

185
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,759
example of the uh lightning uh test

186
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,280
and what it basically comes down to is

187
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
you have your unit under test on the

188
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,479
left

189
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,639
uh and uh some sensing and a power

190
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,120
supply and you take a transformer and

191
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,360
inject a large current a large magnetic

192
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,440
field around the conductor one of the

193
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,600
longer conductors you would have uh on

194
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
your equipment and then you cross your

195
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,759
fingers hope it works and if it breaks

196
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,280
you better go fix it make your design

197
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,160
better

198
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,840
another interesting source of things

199
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,000
that can break your spacecraft are

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,440
cruise ships

201
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,880
this is something i did not realize when

202
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,759
i set out so more generally um around

203
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,319
launch pads there are a lot of radios um

204
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,720
there can be you know radar there can be

205
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,120
uh communication systems um you know

206
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,639
they can communication systems of course

207
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,639
on the actual rocket uh and on your own

208
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,000
spacecraft and all those things have to

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,280
work together

210
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,800
so um

211
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,479
when you design a spacecraft to launch

212
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,160
on a rocket you have to make sure both

213
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,680
that you are not emitting too much

214
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,280
radiation from your radio supposed to

215
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,520
hurt the the rocket itself

216
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,000
and vice versa the rocket uh the

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,599
electromagnetic radiation of the rocket

218
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,240
emits won't hurt your spacecraft so if

219
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
you pull up the user manual of any

220
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,160
launch provider be it spacex united

221
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,560
launch alliance visa so on and so forth

222
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,479
uh you will see these envelopes that you

223
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,720
have to test your spacecraft to and that

224
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,039
uh ensure that those two systems are

225
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,479
compatible

226
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,240
but when you look at how these uh

227
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,160
profiles are derived you can find all

228
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,400
the different sources of radio and radar

229
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,639
uh that come up around the launch pad

230
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,479
and cape canaveral happens to be very

231
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,160
close to a whole bunch of cruise ships

232
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,240
uh which have a whole bunch of emitters

233
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,840
and so you have to design your

234
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,440
spacecraft to withstand cruise ships

235
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,599
so this is a demonstration of roughly

236
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,360
how that kind of testing goes to make

237
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
sure that uh either your individual

238
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,080
units or intel spacecraft

239
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,039
meet these criteria um so we

240
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,919
build these large anechoic chambers

241
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,240
um the word code just means that they

242
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,479
eliminate echo as much as possible so

243
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,639
all of those little triangular

244
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,560
things on the walls are meant to

245
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,400
dissipate electromagnetic waves as the

246
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
electromagnetic waves hit them basically

247
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
simulating a free open space with no

248
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,680
reflections because you would want to

249
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,839
avoid any standing waves

250
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,000
messing with your test

251
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,679
so whether you're testing an individual

252
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,519
unit or an entire spacecraft you would

253
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,880
roll it into one of these encode

254
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,159
chambers

255
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,760
and specifically for this kind of

256
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,240
testing you would either have it operate

257
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,399
and emit whatever radiation it does and

258
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,480
pick that up with an antenna or vice

259
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,959
versa blast some amount of radio energy

260
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,360
from an antenna into your unit and again

261
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,720
verify that it works and meets the

262
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,279
envelopes

263
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,720
another interesting source that i never

264
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,240
thought about

265
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,120
while

266
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,839
until getting my first job there is just

267
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,200
the amount of animals that we have at

268
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,720
space at cape canaveral um so cape

269
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,560
canaveral is actually on a wildlife

270
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,800
refuge so there's all sorts of turtles

271
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
birds bats so and so forth that live all

272
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
throughout that that region um actually

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
even just when you drive from the

274
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,760
entrance to cape canaveral to one of the

275
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,000
pads you'll frequently see turtles

276
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,600
crossing the road and i've had to stop

277
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
and move them off the road to to make

278
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
sure that nobody hits them uh this is a

279
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,000
common thing um so it's actually

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
happened that uh a previous space

281
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,640
shuttle launch has hit a bird illegal as

282
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,880
a vulture on ascent um so after that um

283
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,959
happened nasa had to come up with an

284
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,040
entire bird basement plan

285
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,519
which led to all sorts of programs from

286
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,760
roughly roadkill cleanup to wildlife

287
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,120
crossing signs catch and release

288
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,279
programs sounds uh

289
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,720
cameras tracking

290
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,240
birds uh

291
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,200
radar and so on and so forth

292
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,519
on the right here we also have a very

293
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,519
courageous bat that decided it wanted to

294
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,160
go to space so it clung on to

295
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,640
uh the fuel tank there the space shuttle

296
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,160
and road at least a part of the way up

297
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,439
an ambitious bat i would say

298
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,120
another problem that we have to deal

299
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,399
with is humidity and corrosion um so

300
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,120
because we want to launch over oceans

301
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,040
where you know there is no population

302
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,720
and no risk of hurting anyone should

303
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,880
launch go wrong uh we have to deal with

304
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,720
all the salt and the mist that comes

305
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,000
from uh from that atmosphere

306
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,839
um so in particular you know at cape

307
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,760
canaveral you can kind of see from

308
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,360
almost any launchpad just how close you

309
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,920
are to the ocean uh and something that i

310
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,680
always underestimate is just how much of

311
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,200
an effect that can have

312
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,519
um so you know for something like steel

313
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,360
you could be losing a millimeter per

314
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,399
year of steel mass into

315
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,800
uh two basically salt corrosion uh which

316
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,040
of course weakens the structure of

317
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,800
spacecraft you're trying to launch or

318
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,399
you know for electronics to do all sorts

319
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,279
of other uh horrible things uh and so we

320
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,279
have to design special coatings to deal

321
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,959
with this and of course these special

322
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,880
coatings have to be tested uh to make

323
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
sure that they can withstand

324
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,720
furthermore in the case of uh screw

325
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
driving here on the bottom left um it's

326
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,040
actually designed to be reusable even

327
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,640
after taking a swim

328
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
uh so not only do you have to deal with

329
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,399
corrosion from kind of mist and salt in

330
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,240
the air but what happens when it

331
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,120
actually

332
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,600
spends time in in the ocean before being

333
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,079
pulled out

334
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,480
so as the vehicle takes off there's

335
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,320
quite a bit of shotgun vibration that

336
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,959
occurs so shock events are typically

337
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,640
something that happens

338
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
at key points so for example when

339
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,519
the clamps release the rocket for it to

340
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,440
first take off or when two stages

341
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,279
separate um those are events where

342
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,040
there's kind of a large jolt uh that

343
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,360
happens uh but even outside of that as

344
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
you just take off i don't know if you've

345
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,160
ever seen uh astronauts ride a rocket

346
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,680
you can kind of see them shaking as they

347
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,200
go up

348
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,639
and this is again something we have to

349
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,160
prepare for um so we do testing um both

350
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
at the unit level and at the system

351
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,160
level to prepare for these environments

352
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,760
um so the bottom left here we have an

353
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,800
example by mood uh of a shock test uh

354
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
where they believe they take a pneumatic

355
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,680
actuator and basically punch

356
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,880
a unit

357
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,800
to deliver the shock that you might

358
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,920
expect

359
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,839
in a very controlled manner of course

360
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,880
and

361
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,040
in the middle we have the james in the

362
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,279
entire james webb telescope

363
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,760
basically put on a shaker table

364
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,279
and these environments are defined in

365
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,959
terms of the amount of acceleration they

366
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,200
get versus the frequency at which that

367
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,839
acceleration occurs and so these shaker

368
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:50,959
tables will sweep through those

369
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,800
frequencies and to those amplitudes and

370
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
make sure

371
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
that the spacecraft still holds together

372
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,800
without any major issues

373
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,040
another interesting thing

374
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,639
that is perhaps a little bit less known

375
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,320
uh less obvious than the previous ones

376
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,079
is travel electric charging

377
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,480
so charter electric charging occurs when

378
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
uh two different materials that have a

379
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,079
slightly different affinity for

380
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,720
electrons um come into contact and don't

381
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,920
come apart

382
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,519
so we experience this every day as

383
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,440
static electricity for the most part

384
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,200
when you walk over a carpet or something

385
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,959
and then uh you know get shocked when

386
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,959
you different door handle um you've had

387
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,720
tribal electric charging happen and

388
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,040
charge you up to some large amount uh

389
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,399
something like 30 kilovolts and then

390
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,959
when you touch a grounded door handle

391
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,200
you know you dissipate that and it hurts

392
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,600
um so the same thing happens uh during a

393
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,399
launch um as a rocket flies through you

394
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,360
know the air the atmosphere um

395
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,680
the cloud layers uh the same kind of

396
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,240
charging can happen on the spacecraft

397
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,120
and so um manufacturers of rockets will

398
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,639
actually put constraints on their

399
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,639
launches uh to avoid this issue and

400
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,880
prevent it from uh you know charging up

401
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
the vehicle causing potential arcs or

402
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,360
just interfering with communication

403
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,920
so for example the rs-1x rocket

404
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,399
had to delay some of its launches due to

405
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,760
cloud layers that could lead to tribal

406
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
electric charging uh same thing with

407
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,320
rocket lab

408
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,959
and on the right here we have a plot

409
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,480
that actually shows how this charging

410
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,839
can happen um so this was a study done

411
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,839
with a sounding rocket that

412
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,680
you know went up to i think about 30

413
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,399
kilometers in altitude and as it went up

414
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,000
they measured the electric potential

415
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,839
being built up on the skin

416
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,600
and you can see it starting off close to

417
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,320
zero and rising up to 30 or 40 kilovolts

418
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,399
as it's kind of going up through the

419
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,000
atmosphere and of course also returning

420
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,360
um so once we actually get to orbit

421
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,920
uh we have to think a lot about heat um

422
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,519
and the interesting thing is that this

423
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,600
goes in both directions uh in certain

424
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,440
cases we have not enough heats in

425
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,600
certain cases we have far too much

426
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,560
um so in the first case uh the mars

427
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,360
rovers when sent to mars had to deal

428
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,880
with extremely cold temperatures the

429
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,399
martian atmosphere can get down very

430
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,680
very very cold

431
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,839
and so all of those electronics were put

432
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,360
into what's called the warm electronics

433
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,959
box that's the picture you see on the

434
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,839
right

435
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,880
um

436
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,240
the technicians getting that launch

437
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,199
prepared

438
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,279
uh simply because a lot of electronics

439
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,880
and especially batteries do not perform

440
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,639
well below a certain temperature they

441
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,240
actually had to provide heaters to keep

442
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,480
them warm enough to perform

443
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
but conversely the opposite problem can

444
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,160
also happen um

445
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,320
so at the space station because there is

446
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,480
no atmosphere there's no convective

447
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,040
cooling um which is a kind of a strong

448
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,199
mechanism that we have the benefit here

449
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,000
from on earth uh to cool hot electronics

450
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,120
um

451
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,040
something like a heat sink on earth here

452
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,199
would have a fan to blow air over it and

453
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,720
that fan would kind of touch the

454
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
heatsink and with that convection take

455
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,360
the heat away that's not an option

456
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
and so at the space station they have

457
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,600
deployed these very large radiators

458
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,440
because electromagnetic radiation is the

459
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,199
only way to dissipate heat

460
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,000
so

461
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,920
electronics will be taken and put onto

462
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,199
these

463
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,880
cold plate units

464
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,360
where essentially fluid will run through

465
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
and will heat up and be taken to the

466
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,120
radiators and the radiators will use

467
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,720
electromagnetic radiation to dissipate

468
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,199
that heat

469
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,560
another uh

470
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,199
repercussion of these extreme uh

471
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,720
temperature differences

472
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,360
it also comes up in structural design of

473
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,920
a spacecraft so again back in the apollo

474
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,199
days um they predicted that uh when

475
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,199
traveling towards the moon uh the

476
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,120
spacecraft would heat up to over 100

477
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,680
degrees c on one side and go below minus

478
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,399
100 dbc on the other side which uh for

479
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,079
something as brittle as the heat shield

480
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,680
could cause cracking

481
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
and could break it and so they spent a

482
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,040
lot of time thinking about either

483
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,639
redesigning the heat shield to withstand

484
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,720
that temperature difference or to just

485
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,199
provide heaters to make uh the heat uh

486
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,120
the of the heat on top of the heat

487
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,040
shield kind of even during the coast of

488
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,920
the moon

489
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,279
uh but the solution turned out to be a

490
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,880
lot simpler than that and it's called a

491
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
barbecue bowl

492
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,720
essentially uh what spacecraft will do

493
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,559
when they coast in orbit so essentially

494
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,039
when they're not very active uh is turn

495
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,839
and spin on their axis uh and that

496
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,000
basically just evenly applies heat to

497
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
all sides of the spacecraft and keeps it

498
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,079
pretty even um so on the bottom left

499
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,240
here you see starman from the first

500
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,919
falcon heavy launch and the reason we

501
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,359
see that earth rotating there is

502
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,200
precisely this the spacecraft was

503
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,039
performing a barbecue role

504
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,840
for this exact reason

505
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,520
and speaking of uh other problems with

506
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,440
light and radiation uh

507
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,000
we have a lot of issues with cameras uh

508
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,440
cameras quite unhappy uh so an example

509
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
of electromagnetic radiation causing

510
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,640
havoc on a camera actually also occurred

511
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
on apollo 12

512
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,640
which was i believe the first launch to

513
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,880
bring a color camera to the moon and

514
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,240
unfortunately

515
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,520
one of the astronauts that was on the

516
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,240
surface alan bean uh as he was setting

517
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,880
it up uh pointed the camera at the sun

518
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,080
and burnt out the camera tubes uh and

519
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,600
failed to get good footage for us there

520
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
from that first line from that uh from

521
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,679
that launch

522
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,280
hopefully nobody else is using camera

523
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,039
tubes anymore so hopefully that's not a

524
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,760
problem but it has happened

525
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
a different form of radiation called

526
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,600
ionizing radiation in particular

527
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,280
particulate radiation

528
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,200
also still causes problems to this day

529
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,880
so we have a picture here of chris

530
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,799
hadfield on the space station

531
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,400
and you'll notice if you watch almost

532
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,080
any footage from the space station quite

533
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,320
a lot of burnt out pixels um so those

534
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
are pixels that were hit with charged

535
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,360
particles which i'll talk about a little

536
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,039
bit in a second

537
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,520
and cause damage burnt out and caused

538
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,240
those artifacts

539
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
and speaking of radiation this is a

540
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,400
topic that i enjoy seeing quite a bit on

541
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,799
uh forums reddit the internet a lot of

542
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,559
people are talking about it and it's

543
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
great to see people super interested uh

544
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,240
but i find that there's quite a few

545
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,080
misconceptions simply because we don't

546
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
deal with it every day uh but one

547
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
misconception i'll clear up here is i

548
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,480
assure you spaceman 98 we did not forget

549
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,520
about radiation

550
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,360
so radiation

551
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,280
i of the ionizing times so we're talking

552
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,480
about particles now rather than

553
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
electromagnetic waves

554
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,880
really depends on where you go

555
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,799
and in general in space there are three

556
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,320
major sources that we think about for

557
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,440
missions

558
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,520
so the first source is called the van

559
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,440
allen belts and in a nutshell what's

560
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,720
happening is that

561
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,360
earth has a molten core which creates a

562
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,280
magnetic field around it and that

563
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,600
magnetic field acts as a trap

564
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
because charged particles when they

565
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,600
enter that magnetic field will tend to

566
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,120
get trapped in it they will kind of

567
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,679
gyrate and spin and go up and down

568
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,480
and kind of stay in the same vicinity

569
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,200
and so we have these gigantic

570
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,440
belts full of protons and electrons

571
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,039
jumping all around

572
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,240
at different points but they're

573
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,080
definitely not uniform

574
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
they have a shape and depending on your

575
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,159
mission design you may or may not run

576
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,520
into them

577
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,960
so for example

578
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,640
on the bottom right we have the

579
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
trajectory of again the apollo missions

580
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,320
uh doing their uh translunar

581
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,760
transfer from

582
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,240
low earth orbit over to

583
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,559
lunar orbit and you can see that because

584
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,480
of their inclination they actually get

585
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,039
past the worst parts of the belts

586
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,039
so if you look here kind of right above

587
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,880
the equator in this dense region is

588
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,400
where you would get most particular

589
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,720
radiation and they tend to kind of skirt

590
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,480
around it a little bit minimizing a

591
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,559
little bit of problem now they didn't do

592
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,120
that with that in mind by any means but

593
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,880
it is a lucky circumstance it didn't

594
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,840
have to go down the middle of it

595
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,080
on the bottom left we have a picture of

596
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,039
uh

597
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,679
the contour of radiation at this

598
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,400
altitude of the space station um so even

599
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,080
when you're at the space station you're

600
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,000
actually only inside the van allen belts

601
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
for a relatively short amount of time uh

602
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,360
in this region that we call the south

603
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,840
atlantic anomaly because the saa or

604
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,440
software anomaly

605
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,640
occurs over roughly south america and so

606
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,520
uh around uh every day there are a few

607
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,039
orbits that the space station passes

608
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,720
through this region and for about five

609
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,000
minutes we'll have

610
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
quite a few more protons flying through

611
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,520
the space station before tailing off and

612
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,080
going back to kind of a relatively calm

613
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,240
background level

614
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,679
uh by the way the reason that this

615
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,000
occurs in such an asymmetric way is that

616
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,159
the magnetic field of the earth does not

617
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,840
actually quite go through the center of

618
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,760
it it's a little bit offset and so that

619
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,280
brings the belts a little bit closer on

620
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,720
one side of the earth rather than the

621
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,880
other

622
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,520
uh the second major source is galactic

623
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,880
cosmic rays

624
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,640
so these are particles that are

625
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,760
generated

626
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,080
either in our sun or in other suns in

627
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,440
our solar system

628
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,640
or sorry in our galaxy or completely in

629
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
other galaxies and travel to us from

630
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,240
quite far away

631
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,159
so these tend to be

632
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,400
even more energetic and cause an even

633
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
larger problem but thankfully there are

634
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,440
fewer of them

635
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,720
uh and

636
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,159
the extent to which they are problems

637
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,840
strongly depends again on the earth's

638
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,679
magnetic field the earth's magnetic

639
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,679
field gives us quite a bit of protection

640
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,679
uh if you're at a low altitude and close

641
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,880
to the equator

642
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,320
but if you travel outside of the

643
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,720
atmosphere and at the north pole it's as

644
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,640
if it wasn't there you might as well be

645
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,480
in interplanetary space

646
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,679
and so different missions will have to

647
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,520
consider uh depending on where they go

648
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,000
how much they have to deal with this

649
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,720
an interesting note about the galactic

650
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,919
cosmic rays is that we also get

651
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,000
protection from them from the sun

652
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,840
because our sun also has a magnetic

653
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,720
field

654
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,400
and ironically when the sun is more

655
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,480
active

656
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,960
we'll tend to actually get less galactic

657
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,120
cosmic rays because it's putting a

658
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,799
negative pressure uh and kind of

659
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,559
shielding us from them a little bit more

660
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,240
but when it's less active a solar

661
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,400
minimum that's when galactic cosmic rays

662
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,960
become more of a problem

663
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,919
and the last source as we were talking

664
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,640
about the sun is solar flares um so the

665
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,320
sun likes to throw us curveballs now and

666
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,159
again in the form of more charged

667
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,240
particles we have to deal with uh and

668
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,640
this tends to happen on a 11 year solar

669
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,520
cycle

670
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,159
nobody really understands why um

671
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,679
i'm sure people study it but i have not

672
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,280
seen a solid answer i think it's still

673
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,480
being researched

674
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,400
but about every 11 years the sun gets

675
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
more and less active and more and more

676
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,200
of these flares happen or less and less

677
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,600
and uh these flares when they do occur

678
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,679
they will first emit a lot of uh x-ray

679
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,280
radiation so that's electromagnetic

680
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,200
radiation with very high frequency that

681
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,280
will reach earth relatively quickly give

682
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
us a heads up before following through

683
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,760
with a much larger coronal mass ejection

684
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,799
they're called

685
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,640
and that's the actual protons and

686
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,120
heavier elements that eventually hit us

687
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,279
and our spacecraft so on the top right

688
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,919
here you actually see a prediction of

689
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,159
how that plasma or all those protons and

690
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,520
heavier elements

691
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,600
traveled from the sun to earth at a

692
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,039
relatively recent flare we had at the

693
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,919
beginning of this month

694
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,679
so one interesting misconception about

695
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,360
radiation is that a lot of people

696
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,200
propose shielding as a good solution to

697
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,760
it and unfortunately shielding is not

698
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,000
that great at blocking radiation um it

699
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,320
certainly can work but it's very very

700
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,799
heavy um so for example

701
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,559
for something like a 400 mega electron

702
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,720
volt proton which we do have some of

703
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,559
those in the van allen belts not many

704
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,520
but some

705
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,799
uh you would need as much as 40

706
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,799
centimeters of solid aluminum to stop

707
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,080
that proton

708
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,000
uh and so that's obviously very heavy

709
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,240
and space flight mass is the enemy

710
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
number one and so you want to avoid that

711
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,360
as much as possible

712
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,840
however it is used sometimes so the juno

713
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
spacecraft that went to jupiter

714
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,679
did actually use a half inch of solid

715
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,600
titanium to protect its electronics

716
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,840
because the jovian belts are even more

717
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,200
intense than anything we have to deal

718
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,200
with

719
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,640
so why does radiation do anything to

720
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,080
electronics

721
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,840
so as the name suggests ionizing

722
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,240
radiation means that as a particle

723
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,360
travels through a crystal so like a um

724
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,240
you know a pn junction uh

725
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,039
of a part uh it can ion

726
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,960
ionize the uh atoms in that crystal so

727
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,400
turn them into atoms strip their

728
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,039
electrons away make a charge and then

729
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,720
that charge will separate

730
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,120
uh and some of it will go into

731
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,520
uh you know different regions basically

732
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,480
and that can cause a large temporary

733
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,120
current which can either flip a bit

734
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,840
or it can actually damage your device so

735
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,760
on the bottom left we have

736
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,159
pictures of structural damage due to

737
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:30,960
these

738
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,799
charge currents that happen they heat up

739
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,120
the elements so much that

740
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,320
you actually get you know a little bit

741
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,080
of molten metal and

742
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
fracturing and that can permanently

743
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,559
destroy the device

744
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,960
so the other way that damage refers to

745
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,360
the radiation is kind of less sudden

746
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,080
with the previous examples that i showed

747
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,240
as soon as a particle hits a device uh

748
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,559
you have a catastrophic failure or even

749
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,000
just a big foot that you can kind of

750
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,600
reboot away from

751
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,039
but there's another effect called total

752
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,440
ionization dose where over time

753
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,960
the radiation will

754
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
slowly degrade a crystal

755
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,200
and this can affect regular electronics

756
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,400
so for example on the right we have a

757
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,640
voltage reference that as it was exposed

758
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,799
to more and more radiation uh started to

759
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,279
drift away from its true value uh and

760
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,279
this is not uncommon but it can also

761
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,279
cause damage to

762
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,080
other materials so for example glass

763
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,760
shown here on the bottom left

764
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,120
can degrade and become less transparent

765
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,760
so this is a problem for solar arrays

766
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,360
or fiber optic communications and

767
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,600
materials like that

768
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,880
so what you're seeing here on the bottom

769
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,279
left is darkening of the glass

770
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,120
kind of towards the center where it's

771
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,639
been exposed to more and more radiation

772
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,919
another solution to this problem is to

773
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,000
use radiation hardened parts which are

774
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,799
more or less practically immune

775
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,960
to these kinds of strikes

776
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,559
but the major problem with that is that

777
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,480
just that they're expensive

778
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,640
so for example the rad750 has been used

779
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,559
on quite a few nasa missions you know

780
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,600
for the rovers and uh other spacecraft

781
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,559
and

782
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,480
you are getting 200 megahertz of

783
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,039
performance for 200 000 per processor

784
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,640
this is priced from 2002 i don't know

785
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,480
what these are now but that gives you an

786
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,440
idea

787
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,840
um so that's actually not necessarily a

788
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,960
great way to go unless you're only

789
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,559
making one of that spacecraft and it's

790
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,720
extremely valuable uh the way we

791
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
actually try to deal with these things

792
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,200
whenever possible is to screen parts by

793
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,480
taking them to

794
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,080
uh facilities where we can recreate the

795
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,559
standard radiation on earth

796
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,840
eliminating the ones that we know are

797
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,320
going to be bad uh and then building in

798
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,120
a whole bunch of circuitry to try to

799
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,200
mitigate the effects so these could be

800
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
current limiters these could be washed

801
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,039
up circuits that reboot certain parts

802
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,799
this could be redundancy and some

803
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,039
combination of all those things can be

804
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,720
sufficient to accomplish the mission

805
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,520
with

806
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,559
with high certainty

807
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,039
another problem that you get from the

808
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,799
van allen belts is charging from

809
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,039
electrons so just like we have proton

810
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,200
particles bombarding a spacecraft we

811
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,640
also have electron particles bombarding

812
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,279
spacecraft and although they will not

813
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,760
necessarily have the same effect they

814
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,000
can still cause destructive failures

815
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,320
so electrons can accumulate at the

816
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,559
surface of your spacecraft or penetrate

817
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,320
deeper into the bulk of it

818
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,159
and again cause charging kind of like

819
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,840
travel electric charging but slightly

820
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,279
different mechanism

821
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,520
and if that uh potential builds up to

822
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,559
too high of a level uh you could get a

823
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,880
discharge or an arc and so what you're

824
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,960
seeing here is uh on the right is an

825
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,640
example of a discharge that happened i

826
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,480
believe on orbit with the eureka

827
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,200
satellite that damaged the solar cell uh

828
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,480
because the body of the spacecraft

829
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,799
personally fetch ours up too far

830
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,480
and then discharged into the solar wave

831
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,840
and burnt solar ray out

832
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,120
and lastly uh or second to last effect

833
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,279
is tin whiskers

834
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,799
this is an effect where a bulk uh metal

835
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,200
will spontaneously grow whiskers uh

836
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,039
without an electric field or without any

837
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,320
other presumed uh reason um it is

838
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,840
believed that this is caused by

839
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,480
mechanical stress and crystals but it's

840
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,159
still not a fully well understood effect

841
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,159
so people are researching it

842
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,880
but over time as these riskers can grow

843
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,840
that can cause a short circuit on orbit

844
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,639
which of course could be destructive

845
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,399
and lastly um

846
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,159
on the way back the spacecraft will have

847
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,240
to deal with re-entry plasma

848
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,679
so re-entry plasma occurs when

849
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,840
spacecraft hits the atmosphere basically

850
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,480
so hard that it turns into plasma

851
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
and that plasma becomes kind of like a

852
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,480
faraday cage around the spacecraft uh

853
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,320
preventing radio communications from

854
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,279
getting through um so in the shuttle for

855
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,200
example or almost any other spacecraft

856
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,240
coming back there will be a

857
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,480
communications blackout period where

858
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,320
there's no way to get any data from the

859
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,559
spacecraft or communicate with the crew

860
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,840
in any way

861
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,200
um

862
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,559
and uh

863
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,039
it's it's a very interesting phenomena

864
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,320
and

865
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,159
it may be possible to

866
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,760
use higher frequency radios to

867
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,000
communicate past it um or people have

868
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,320
also suggested like dumping materials

869
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,919
into the plasma as the spacecraft comes

870
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,120
down um to try to mitigate it um but so

871
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,039
far i haven't seen anything uh that's

872
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,559
actually tried to get past this for the

873
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,240
most part spacecraft just deal with this

874
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,080
problem by anticipating that there won't

875
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,360
be communication at that point

876
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,720
and just as the last moment here i have

877
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,159
a few other resources for anybody who

878
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,320
likes space stuff there's a lot of fun

879
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,080
stuff here by a lot of great creators on

880
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,640
youtube and

881
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,080
in other places

882
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,600
and so i recommend checking these out if

883
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,279
you found this interesting

884
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,480
and that's it thank you very much
