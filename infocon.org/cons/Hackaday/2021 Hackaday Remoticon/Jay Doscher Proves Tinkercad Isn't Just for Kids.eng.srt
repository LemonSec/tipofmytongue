1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,879
hello everybody and welcome back

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,360
now over the years we've seen a lot of

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,840
cyber decks and other homemade portable

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,080
computers but if there's one name that

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,000
stands above all the others it's jay

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,279
dosher his ruggedized and mil-spec

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,199
raspberry pie computers take some

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,199
beating and to be honest they can take a

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,039
beating

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,800
but he's never been one to stand on his

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,240
laurels and we know that whenever he

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,679
produces something there'll be another

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,359
one along

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,480
sooner or later to improve upon it now

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,280
all

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,960
this work requires quite a lot of cad

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,800
work so he's going to be taking us

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,600
through his work with tinkercad both as

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,040
an introduction he's offering us an

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
introduction as well as a path for those

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,680
who are about to outgrow it so hello jay

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,399
welcome and take it away

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,559
all right thank you jenny

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,399
all right everybody give me a second to

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,680
get my screen share going

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,120
all right

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,399
and while i get this up and going

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,080
this is going to be an interactive

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,600
session so if you hop over into general

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,159
i'm actually going to be happy to

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,040
answer questions and kind of deep dive

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,960
where we need to uh so we have a pretty

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,720
flexible agenda

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,600
so

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,040
um

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,320
first off uh you know if you don't know

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,000
um a cyber deck uh came from i believe

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,720
william gibson movie or a book um

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,840
hopefully maybe a good movie someday um

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,439
but the idea is

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,240
it's a computer that was used in the

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,600
books to

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,560
uh connect cybernetically into

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,119
the precursor to the internet

45
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,079
um

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,560
today what that really means is a

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,920
scratch-built

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,960
uh computer usually the enclosure um you

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,799
know screen usb ports um

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,520
a many times a raspberry pi even though

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,119
those are getting quite expensive right

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,280
now um

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,240
so

54
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,520
um

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,799
what i did was i i bought a 3d printer i

56
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,360
started printing out things years ago

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,440
um just you know trinkets and things

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,599
like that and i started i really

59
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,520
struggled with slicers and all of the

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,720
things and then i started to look at

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,879
options for cad

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,319
and i looked at a fusion and the first

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,400
thing that hits you with fusion is the

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,040
price tag frankly um

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,280
and one thing led to another

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,000
and um i started playing around with

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,280
tinkercad

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,440
and i could go back and maybe if we have

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,840
some time i'll actually this is my

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,319
production uh tinkercad account and i

71
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,239
can go back into the

72
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,319
cringeworthy early things that i did

73
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,720
that were mostly cylinders and and

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,080
things like that i think the first

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
functional part that i made

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,680
was a uh part for to fix a screen door

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,640
but

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
let's let's talk about what tinkercad is

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
tinkercad is primarily an educational

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,319
tool but part of what's fun about just

81
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,720
hacking in general is taking something

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,879
that was intended kind of for one thing

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,640
and using it for something completely

84
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,959
different um we're not violating any

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,440
terms of service here or anything and in

86
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,560
fact

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,120
tinkercad encourages and has license

88
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,840
options to share things availa freely

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
and uh through many uh open source

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,040
licenses

91
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,319
so it's cool that it's free um you can

92
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,920
protect it with multi-factor

93
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
authentication

94
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,599
and

95
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,159
um it's browser based

96
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,599
now i like to use tinkercad on a 4k

97
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,799
screen so

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,560
if you're going to have a 4k monitor you

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,599
might want a fairly

100
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,879
decently powerful video card to do that

101
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,720
but you can do it on a laptop if you

102
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,519
need to or if you're more patient um but

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,840
it's very easy to get started and i'm

104
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,439
actually going to show you

105
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,000
um you know jenny actually like implied

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,760
hey some new stuff is coming what you

107
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,000
see on the screen is something that i

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
actually have parts for

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,080
um for something that's coming out soon

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
and i'm going to be sharing it

111
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,519
and i i'm trying to make them even

112
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,840
tougher um so we're going to actually

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,200
take this one and we're going to take it

114
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,399
apart

115
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,440
um

116
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,918
but before we go and take it apart what

117
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,279
i'm going to do is i'm going to show you

118
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,919
some examples here of how this is very

119
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,360
different from many other cad programs

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
many other cad programs and i'll use

121
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
fusion because that's the one that i'm

122
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,919
starting with as a frame of reference um

123
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,160
starts with a line drawing

124
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,919
a two-dimensional drawing so if you were

125
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,759
to draw something out on a piece of

126
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,880
paper

127
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,520
and then you take that and you extrude

128
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,919
it or you build up from there

129
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,479
um tinkercad works completely different

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,720
and the only reason that's a problem is

131
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,479
that mentally

132
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,720
you you kind of grow attached to the one

133
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,680
that you learn and so famously i've said

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,199
multiple times over the last couple of

135
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,720
years okay i'm not going to make

136
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,880
anything more in tinkercad i'm going to

137
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
go over to fusion i'm going to go over

138
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,960
to opennesscad or something

139
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,759
and

140
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,759
i always come back to tinkercad because

141
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,440
i'm it's so familiar and um

142
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
and i'm so comfortable with it i can

143
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,680
move i can work very very quickly in it

144
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
so i'm going to show you some things

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,759
that this design has that i think are

146
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,720
going to be helpful for people

147
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,560
there are some things though that i want

148
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,039
you to be aware of that are limitations

149
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,720
of tinkercad

150
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,639
i'll tell you right now

151
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,199
if you were to send parts out

152
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,840
to get them a

153
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,400
or laser cut or some of that

154
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,080
it's it's going to be limited and you're

155
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,800
going to have to do some extra steps uh

156
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,639
with your files um it doesn't support uh

157
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,919
dxf

158
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,880
which is common for uh some some machine

159
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,400
shops depending on what software they

160
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,800
use for for cutting their parts

161
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,400
and uh svg is limited so even though i'm

162
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,919
going to use an example here i can

163
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,560
actually go here let me move my screen

164
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
and i can go export and i can say svg

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,639
here

166
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,160
but guess what there's a little bug in

167
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,880
tinkercad and if i move this down this

168
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,840
is on the build area

169
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,080
if i was to raise this up off of the

170
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,600
build area and you can see a little

171
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
shadow there and i export this as an svg

172
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,039
it's an empty svg

173
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,160
so

174
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,080
there's some bugs like that and that's

175
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,680
you kind of got to work around some of

176
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,840
that

177
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,440
and the biggest one the number one thing

178
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,759
that you're not going to be able to do

179
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,280
with tinkercad

180
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,520
is generate step files

181
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,240
and a perfect example is i have a 3d

182
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,960
model here i could export this as an stl

183
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,720
right now in fact i've printed a number

184
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
of these

185
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
but if i wanted to send this to a

186
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,479
machine shop maybe i wanted to make a

187
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,400
really cool one out of aluminum which i

188
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,479
would love to do

189
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,280
i can't do it with tinkercad and so i

190
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,960
have to generate what's called a step

191
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,520
file and that's required for uh for

192
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,560
milling and so guess what

193
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,280
the the challenge is is maybe i might be

194
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,160
able to somehow convert an stl into a

195
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
step or something like that but if i

196
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
need to go and modify it if the machine

197
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,919
shop comes back and says hey this

198
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,599
tolerance is too low and we'll talk

199
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,919
about tolerances in a second

200
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,400
and you have to move this or move that

201
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,919
you're now jumping through all these

202
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,400
extra hoops whereas if you were using

203
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
fusion or something like that you could

204
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
generate you could just move the you

205
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
know move the whole reprocess export the

206
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
step file so

207
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
um if you're planning on doing

208
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,919
professional cnc build in the time to

209
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,639
learn a new tool that said

210
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,240
uh if you do

211
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,800
if you're just gonna 3d print stuff

212
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,039
let's have some fun shall we so

213
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,479
um this file is one of my i'll tell you

214
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,400
one one of my secrets right now

215
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,240
i love to print a sm on a smooth bed so

216
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,000
the the face and if i flip this over

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,879
let's see if this will flip over for me

218
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,879
this face is going to be on on the print

219
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,639
bed and it's going to come out nice and

220
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,479
smooth or if i have a textured bed i

221
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,879
could get the cool textured finish

222
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,199
but i don't use supports and i try to

223
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,599
make things that don't use supports

224
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,680
so when you're designing something you

225
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
want to keep that in mind and i'll use

226
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,479
an example

227
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,280
this is the frame for a cyber deck

228
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,720
um

229
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,080
and i'm going to lower this back down

230
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,200
okay

231
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
and if you look here's my bracket and i

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,839
use these two little holes i have a

233
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,479
little hole there and a little hole here

234
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,440
and those two align it now another thing

235
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,920
that cad programs are great for

236
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,399
is making parts line up if you need a

237
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,279
hole to line up or if you need

238
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,200
a joint or a hinge or something like

239
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,279
that there's all these complex

240
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,000
functionality that you can do for that

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
i have some tips and tricks that we're

242
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,399
going to show on how i do it so first

243
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,320
off i'm going to select both of these

244
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,200
parts

245
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
i'm going to come up here to a line

246
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,959
and then what i'm going to do is i'm

247
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,880
going to click the red part

248
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,560
and i'm going to click this to align it

249
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
to the left

250
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
and then i'm going to click up here

251
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,000
to align it to the top

252
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,240
and then i'm going to pivot down and i'm

253
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,080
going to align it to the top and you can

254
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,680
see here it's kind of got this weird

255
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,200
color

256
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,680
but if i click this green one and i just

257
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
bring it raise it up

258
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,399
i've made these parts so that those

259
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,760
holes line up and i'm going to show you

260
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,200
how i do that

261
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
and we'll start with this bracket the

262
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,640
bracket's the easy one

263
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,440
so you can go in by the way any of the

264
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,000
stuff that's that that i've shared on

265
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,519
back seven dot co

266
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,640
and i point back to the tinkercad files

267
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,200
i get many many people that say hey can

268
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,360
you send me the mechanical. drawing for

269
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
this or hey can you send me the source

270
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
for this

271
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,920
tinkercad is really cool all you got to

272
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,200
do is go in here and click ungroup

273
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,680
and we click on group and what do we see

274
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,800
we see what's called a soft box

275
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
and then we have another soft box inside

276
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,760
of it

277
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,200
and then we have another a set of

278
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,560
of cylinders

279
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,800
now each one of these cylinders has a

280
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
specific size i'm going to talk about

281
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,320
sizing in just a second

282
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,360
but

283
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,519
this middle piece is here just to save

284
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,800
on plastic we could easily um what i

285
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,640
like to do is instead of deleting it i

286
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,560
like to raise it up i can look at it

287
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,920
this way

288
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
so i could easily print that it's going

289
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,079
to print more plastic and it's not going

290
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:38,880
to

291
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,839
um

292
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,600
it's not going to help me help us any so

293
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,760
i'll hit control z

294
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,839
and

295
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,160
um and put it back now

296
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,000
a few of these holes

297
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,800
are

298
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,079
um are for the screen mounts so you can

299
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,240
see those are 4.3

300
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,720
um i actually had to make these larger

301
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,120
because i heard back like i mentioned

302
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,600
earlier i heard back from a cnc shop

303
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,720
that said hey

304
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
uh we can't make holes that small make

305
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,880
them bigger and so i did so these are

306
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,800
all 4.3 4.3 millimeters

307
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,640
and if you'll notice

308
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,920
these are 5.1 now if you know any of my

309
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,640
builds you know i love m5 screws i love

310
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,480
to use m5 screws and part of it is

311
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,399
because i kind of have these kinds of

312
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,800
things on speed dial and so if you look

313
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,279
though why would i make a hole

314
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,040
for an m5 screw

315
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,959
5.1

316
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,800
and it's a very simple answer when you

317
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,279
print when you 3d print

318
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,480
even a

319
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,640
very well calibrated printer is going to

320
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
extrude a little bit out which means the

321
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,519
parts always going to be a little bit

322
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,600
bigger than what you wanted and the

323
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,279
holes are all going to be a little bit

324
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,320
smaller

325
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
so when i make this i don't actually

326
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
want

327
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,639
my m5 screw catching on these holes so i

328
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,760
make it just ever so slightly bigger

329
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,440
now i'm going to leave that ungrouped

330
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
and the more interesting lessons come in

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,480
this red part

332
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,800
and so i'm going to ungroup that

333
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,680
and boy you see a bunch of crazy stuff

334
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,040
so first off

335
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,440
we're going to look at this hole here

336
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
and i'm going to ungroup that

337
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,560
you're going to see this one and if i

338
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,279
extrude this up you're going to notice

339
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,880
they match

340
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,120
this is part of how i do

341
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,079
parts

342
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,959
so if i wanted to actually make

343
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,880
another one of these i could actually

344
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
bring it in

345
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,240
and i'm going to lower it down a little

346
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,560
bit and again

347
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,279
align it

348
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,079
with this one and we'll make it a little

349
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,000
easier to uh

350
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,440
we'll make it a different color here

351
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,720
it'll make it a nice pink

352
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,720
and again i'm going to hold down my

353
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,279
shift and select both things and then go

354
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,200
to align

355
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,519
oops

356
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,480
undo

357
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,399
i'm going to hold that

358
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,600
and that one

359
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,839
and align and i want i don't want this

360
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,200
bottom one to move so i'm going to click

361
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,320
the yellow

362
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,720
and now you notice the pink part

363
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,399
so now uh in tinkercad i literally

364
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,200
can

365
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,000
control c control v

366
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and bring up and so now i have and i'll

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,480
make it orange so it's easy to see

368
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,560
i'm going to zoom in here

369
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,240
and i can actually then center it

370
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,440
based on this bottom one

371
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,880
select it

372
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
move it up i'm going to change it from

373
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,399
orange to a hole

374
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,160
i'm going to multi-select

375
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
the pink part and now i'm going to group

376
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,040
them together now of a hole that lines

377
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,360
up with the part below it

378
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,440
so it can be a little tedious can be a

379
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,839
little bit messy um and it's time

380
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,240
consuming sure but you can easily make

381
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,440
parts that line up like brackets

382
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,360
so now what i'm going to do though is

383
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,079
i'm going to get rid of

384
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,920
that bracket we don't need it with what

385
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,360
we're going to do next

386
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,240
so now you can see i've got

387
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,760
the base

388
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,959
you can see

389
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,600
i've got um i've got the hole for the

390
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
screen and i'll tell you

391
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,480
uh if you are looking at making parts

392
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,560
and if you don't have them already

393
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,639
uh just for handy reference

394
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,079
a metric uh i use a just a cloth tape

395
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,120
measure

396
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,839
for big stuff just to get rough part

397
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,720
size

398
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,040
and then calipers you get cheap ones i

399
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,160
think there are 20 25 bucks on amazon

400
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,959
and measure measure measure measure and

401
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,639
test print and test print we'll talk

402
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,680
about that in a little bit

403
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,920
so you've only got a few minutes left so

404
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,680
i'm going to kind of go through this a

405
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,399
little bit faster but if you look

406
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,800
you can see i've got everything kind of

407
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,240
grouped together

408
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,720
so here's the jack for the ethernet and

409
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,480
i know hey there's my m3 screw but

410
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,519
notice i've got it at 3.5 i know from

411
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,880
experience

412
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,680
the

413
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,920
ethernet brackets or the ethernet ports

414
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,560
or jacks that that i buy don't have

415
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,399
great tolerance they got a little nut

416
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,399
that kind of floats in there a lot so

417
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,839
i've made that hole just a little bit

418
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,399
bigger but i can take this piece

419
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,600
this piece

420
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,160
and this piece and i can literally group

421
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
them together

422
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,639
so now i can take those and i can move

423
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,240
those wherever i want in my project

424
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,120
so

425
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,399
um

426
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,560
so that's like an ethernet jack it makes

427
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,040
it really easy for me just to go through

428
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,000
and reuse one uh you know on future

429
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,759
projects

430
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,600
here's another one of my favorites

431
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,839
actually this is a more recent one

432
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,160
and we're going to move it out so it's a

433
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
little easier oops

434
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,800
control z here

435
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,839
yep

436
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,639
so let's see

437
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,639
yep

438
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,720
okay

439
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
all right so thank you jenny

440
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,199
um so

441
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,680
if we ungroup this if you look

442
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,440
this is a notch

443
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,800
um for the usbc power

444
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,639
and if i group this together now this is

445
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,000
going to require a little bit of mental

446
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,240
gymnastics but bear with me

447
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,880
so the hole that i know that it needs

448
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,240
for the jack it's 15.5 millimeters by

449
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,040
15.5 millimeters but it's got a flat

450
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,680
side to it and that fly flat side keeps

451
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,240
it from twisting also makes it

452
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,720
aesthetically a little cooler because um

453
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,279
well frankly it it makes it so the usbc

454
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,959
port always kind of lines up one way or

455
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,240
the other

456
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,320
but it would be a really complicated

457
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,199
thing to go through sometimes

458
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,680
and create some custom grouping or

459
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,399
something in fact but in fact it's

460
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,399
actually pretty easy so i start off with

461
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
my cylinder and notice it's not a hole

462
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,880
and here's my flat side that i know

463
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,120
happens to be

464
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
happens to be 1.1

465
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,839
um millimeters and i'm going to take

466
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,599
those and i'm going to group them

467
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,520
together so now i have my flat side

468
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,640
cylinder

469
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,559
and then i can change this from a solid

470
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
to a hole

471
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
and then i can actually stretch it out

472
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,919
and make it as big as i want for

473
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,199
grabbing on

474
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,160
i can move it around

475
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,839
so

476
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,599
um and if you look

477
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,679
you know you heard the expression

478
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,720
kind of turtles all the way down this is

479
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,200
one this is groupings all the way down

480
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,080
so if we go and take this apart

481
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,240
what you're gonna see

482
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,600
if we take this and ungroup it

483
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,480
it's more rounded rectangles

484
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,120
we've got some trickery up here

485
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,000
but it's a i've it's a pretty simple

486
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,120
part

487
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,000
so

488
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,280
um

489
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,400
that's

490
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,919
that's kind of

491
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,679
i would say some of the basics on what

492
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,880
you can make

493
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,840
um

494
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
pretty straightforward stuff

495
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,799
um

496
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,720
i'm gonna use one more example and this

497
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,480
is one i actually have the prop and it's

498
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,440
actually finished and printed and that

499
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,320
one is this one i call it uh the next

500
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,720
generation camera and i've got a v2 on

501
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,240
here for myself

502
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,520
and if you look

503
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,280
if i ungroup each one of these you're

504
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,440
going to see multiple cylinders

505
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,480
but you're going to see they're at

506
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,840
different heights

507
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,200
and you're going to see kind of little

508
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,440
steps inside of each one

509
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,640
and that's for these little things right

510
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,360
here and i'll hold one up to the webcam

511
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,480
these are threaded inserts now normally

512
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,280
on many many of my decks

513
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,520
i will for an m5 screw i'll make the

514
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,400
whole 4.8 millimeters wide and i'll just

515
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,160
pressure fit the screw in and if it's

516
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,000
just getting assembled once

517
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,960
um

518
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,160
i think a a um i think a popular

519
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,760
youtuber went and did a bunch of stress

520
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,840
testing on thread you know threaded

521
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,400
inserts versus pressure fit and they're

522
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,640
basically about the same strength

523
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,679
um

524
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,760
but the pressure fit ones you can you

525
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,600
can strip the threads you can wear them

526
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,840
out and stuff like that um but i wanted

527
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,400
to make something to hold the next

528
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
generation uh raspberry pi camera um i

529
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,080
have one i need to experiment with it

530
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,320
it's kind of heavy and kind of ungainly

531
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,160
by itself and i wanted something that

532
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,960
would hold a raspberry pi and the camera

533
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,320
and i wanted something where i could

534
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
attach and detach different things to it

535
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,640
because i wanted to kind of create one

536
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,679
unit

537
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,480
and

538
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,160
all of these parts

539
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,200
are essentially it now this part up here

540
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,720
i haven't made yet

541
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,120
but i'll hold up here

542
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,760
and show you this is what it looks like

543
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,039
assembled

544
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,039
in each one

545
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,799
each one of those holes

546
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,960
has a pressure fit in there all right

547
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,039
sorry not a pressure fit has a threaded

548
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,440
insert in each one

549
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,480
and so

550
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,880
threaded inserts are probably not

551
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,799
something i would consider beginner but

552
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,120
they're not that hard you can get

553
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,679
soldering tips for

554
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,400
for

555
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
the um threaded inserts on amazon i

556
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,559
think it's like 20 bucks for a set of

557
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,440
five and that includes like m5 and m3

558
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
which are an empty and even a little

559
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,480
tiny m 2.5 one

560
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,360
so

561
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,679
i think from there i'm going to hop over

562
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,280
and i'm going to take a look at the

563
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,600
questions in the um

564
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,840
i'm going to look in both the general

565
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,240
chat but if you have questions feel free

566
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,799
to jump into the remoticon questions i'd

567
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,559
be happy to answer any questions you may

568
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,520
have

569
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
feel free to tag me i'm in there as back

570
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,760
7 at back

571
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,200
the number seven

572
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,640
but i'd be happy to go in and take a

573
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
look and answer any questions that you

574
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,520
might have about tinkercad

575
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,760
while i'm looking for folks to ask

576
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
questions i will go

577
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,880
into

578
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,919
the

579
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,559
gallery here be a little brave

580
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,640
and go back into

581
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,600
the very first let's see we have 31

582
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
you can see me printing out toys you can

583
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,440
see camera

584
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,919
camera supports

585
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,320
solar receptor

586
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,480
you can see me starting with different

587
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,360
kinds of pieces

588
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,159
so i see a lot of i see and and i have a

589
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,760
lot of hacker friends that talk about

590
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,159
openscad um i would say if you want open

591
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,520
if you want uh a long-term kind of

592
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,440
support you want you want something

593
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,039
that's free you want something that

594
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,799
works offline

595
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,480
it's it's pretty much got to be open

596
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,520
scan

597
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,440
um

598
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,000
tinkercad does require internet and does

599
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,679
require

600
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,240
you know an autodesk account

601
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,360
fusion

602
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,080
cannot work offline for a little while

603
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,200
but

604
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,440
does essentially need online access

605
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,360
the one thing that i would also add

606
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,960
is that you really want to make sure

607
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,480
that you're thinking about what it is

608
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,000
you're trying to do

609
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,880
so if we go in and look

610
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,440
part of what i use tinkercad for was

611
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
learning

612
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
i was learning about different aspects

613
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,159
of design

614
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,200
um you know making different brackets

615
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,760
um i see elliott's mentioning freecad

616
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,520
i'm not familiar with freecad but but

617
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,320
definitely um think about

618
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,679
think about and make um

619
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,200
think about what

620
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
like be intentional about your use of

621
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,400
the platform

622
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,159
um

623
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,960
um yeah and i see a question from kevin

624
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,360
am i worried about um them charging for

625
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,280
tinkercad at some point

626
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,400
um i'm not particularly worried frankly

627
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,200
um

628
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,240
this is a great educational tool uh for

629
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,880
individuals and they really are focused

630
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,200
on getting and this is frankly it is

631
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,960
designed for children so if we go into

632
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,039
the the different shape galleries

633
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,640
they've got a lot of stuff in there for

634
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,600
kids

635
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,400
um

636
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,000
i'm not worried about them charging for

637
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,200
tinkercad

638
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,240
um

639
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,960
but again um

640
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,760
a lot of the designs that are in here um

641
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,640
aren't really portable to other systems

642
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,280
so i could take an stl

643
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,159
um out of tinkercad and into another cad

644
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,159
program but i'd still have to reverse

645
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,000
engineer them so that's the thing that

646
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,080
you have to keep in mind is that

647
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,360
um it is free it is easy to use but

648
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,120
longer term you want to be definitely

649
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,760
looking at other platforms

650
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,400
all righty let's see i think we got one

651
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,840
other question

652
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,279
um

653
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,400
uh so immersive pencil asks why did i

654
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,080
get into making

655
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,039
um

656
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,360
well i started the back i've been making

657
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
stuff for for quite a while i would say

658
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,240
earliest uh for me has been woodworking

659
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,559
in high school um and it's very

660
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,360
satisfying to have an idea uh and and

661
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,520
and bring it bring it into the world i

662
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,919
think it's it's it's immensely rewarding

663
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,200
to do that

664
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,880
um

665
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,559
i would say um i would say i started

666
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,000
back seven stuff after uh doing a class

667
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,080
with jimmy deresta out in upstate new

668
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,640
york where i did uh blacksmithing and i

669
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,120
did axe making neither of which are

670
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,720
realistic for me here in southern

671
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,919
california

672
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,480
uh but i learned uh

673
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,039
you can focus your energy um and focus

674
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,240
on the things that that you're

675
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,600
passionate about

676
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,720
and um and and that's part of what this

677
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,520
is

678
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,799
um

679
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,679
as with cyber decks i made the first one

680
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,279
and in fact you can see it it's hiding

681
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,559
it's sitting right there on my desk

682
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,240
behind me um

683
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,960
that's the first one i made i think um

684
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,279
that's the raspberry pi recovery kit

685
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,080
um

686
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,640
i made that before i knew what cyber

687
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,120
decks were so i found the community

688
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,600
after i made that um and i still love

689
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,880
making them and um you know i i make the

690
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,120
plants freely available i also sell them

691
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,559
and there's just so many different

692
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,720
stories that i see people tag me on

693
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,400
instagram all the time of things that

694
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,480
they've made them for ham radio geeks

695
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,799
use them people use them for direction

696
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,360
finding off-grid computers all kinds of

697
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,559
stuff so

698
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,159
um

699
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,200
yeah so uh uh in a i think if i'm

700
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,440
getting your name right um what's my

701
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,600
strategy for multi-component projects

702
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,799
and parts

703
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,880
we're almost out of time but let me show

704
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,200
you an example of one that i'm working

705
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,000
on right now

706
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,559
and the the really what it comes down to

707
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,720
is making stuff line up

708
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,679
and and making stuff fit

709
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,080
and what i will do is i will do test

710
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,159
prints and so

711
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,760
here's an example of one that i'm

712
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,600
working on right now

713
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,880
and if i take this file this yellow file

714
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,799
and actually

715
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,840
if i reach under my desk i actually have

716
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,400
a test print of that file so i test

717
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,279
print i make sure that it fits within

718
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,679
the enclosure or the space

719
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,679
and then i start printing i don't often

720
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,919
do i rarely do uh top infill i mean you

721
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,360
know top layers and things like that

722
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,200
just because i don't need it i just need

723
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,640
to make sure the shape is right just

724
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,080
need it to be rigid

725
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,360
um

726
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,200
that's part of the challenge is making

727
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,960
some of these more complex things i kind

728
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,240
of bump my head up against the

729
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,400
limitations of tinkercad

730
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,559
and i i will need to i will need to to

731
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,639
move to another platform soon

732
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,640
um

733
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,159
i would say would i

734
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,400
dim i see you asked the question

735
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,640
uh would i say that that uh planning

736
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,039
builds and tinkercad is still worth it

737
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,799
if you're not into 3d printing um

738
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,480
yes um

739
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,840
just for for fit um if so perfect

740
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,760
example um

741
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,120
i'm not a visual i'm not a a mental

742
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,919
uh

743
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,760
a 3d person

744
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,000
i know what i think looks good and i can

745
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,600
see it on the screen

746
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,159
and i can say yes that's what i want but

747
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,039
if you ask me to visualize the clearance

748
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,640
on one of my

749
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,440
cyber decks of the usb ports and the

750
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,200
raspberry pi and the display and the

751
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,159
bolts

752
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,399
i can't do it in my head so i rely on a

753
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,320
combination of cad

754
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,200
and the actual physical model now if i

755
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,000
had a more kind of professional cad

756
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,320
setup i'd have 3d models for all of my

757
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,279
parts like you can actually import like

758
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,760
a raspberry pi and you can make 3d

759
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,840
models for all of your stuff and then

760
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,080
you can just do it all in cad in fact

761
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,760
professional cad folks that's what they

762
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,440
do they have

763
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,760
all of the components where i kind of

764
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,919
get this close kind of visualize it

765
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,080
throw it together so this is this is not

766
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,880
a professional setup

767
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,919
and so in a yes you can you can

768
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,080
um so real quick here because i think

769
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,240
we're almost out of time

770
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,559
if i go and collect the export

771
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,480
it will do everything in the design

772
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,200
which is like an unusable file or i can

773
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,520
go in and click an individual file and

774
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,320
click export and i can export as an obj

775
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,120
or

776
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,880
a gltf or an stl and so yes you can do

777
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,760
them one at a time

778
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,039
all righty

779
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,159
um so

780
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,240
uh a couple things that i would make

781
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,679
sure to do if you're interested in cyber

782
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,799
decks you can either follow me

783
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,200
on instagram i'm kind of just there now

784
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,760
not really anywhere else at back seven

785
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,880
dot co

786
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,840
um

787
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,960
you can

788
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,200
message me here and i can either provide

789
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,559
a link for

790
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,799
uh the cyber deck discord which is a

791
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,000
fantastic discord server um

792
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,399
you know i kind of the one putting stuff

793
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,960
in pelican cases um

794
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,880
but there's so many other designs out

795
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,159
there but hit me up i'm on discord

796
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,720
and happy to help
