1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,640
all right everyone welcome back to

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,880
hackaday emoticon

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,639
our next speaker deborah ansell has

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,400
spent the last decade making things

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,440
blink

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,599
you might remember her exquisite leather

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,480
and led handbag from a few years ago

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,800
nowadays she is creating modular pcbs

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,960
that form dynamically reconfigurable

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,480
electronic systems for pcbs pcb based

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,720
displays and wearables in other words

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,400
she's still making things blink but in

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,079
cooler ways

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,760
earlier this year we covered debra's

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,360
interlocking triangle light panel

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,200
sculpture that uses a clever

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,440
electromechanical interconnection system

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
in the form of spring contacts today she

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
will speak all about the building blocks

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,800
of modular modular pcb design please

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,160
welcome deborah ansell

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,480
thank you

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,319
i hope everything sounds okay

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,840
hi i'm deborah ansell and thank you for

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,480
attending my talk on modular systems of

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,799
printed circuit boards generally known

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,520
as pcbs

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,280
as was said i've been building

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,920
electronics mostly leds projects for

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,400
over a decade but i only learned to

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,920
design pcbs a few years ago

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,720
perhaps because it's a recent skill

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,040
that i'm still building i often find

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,680
myself exploring non-standard ways to

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,080
apply it and a brief digression that's

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,880
not in my notes um i have been

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,960
tremendously enjoying the wonderful

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,079
talks

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,119
at remoticon thus far and was a bit

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,280
anxious that i think my talk has a

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,119
little bit lower information density

42
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,840
than the previous ones but i hope that

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
after absorbing so much information if

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,200
you're watching this live that you'll

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
enjoy um listening a bit more to the

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,520
process and looking at some bright

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,680
blinky leds a little bit

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,799
so

49
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,680
let's go to share screen if i can get

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,119
this

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,159
going okay this should be okay

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,680
let me know if it's not but i think i am

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,520
now sharing screen

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
all right so

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,639
in a project

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,959
pcbs are usually used for their

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,200
electrical function but they can make

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,680
good mechanical building blocks as well

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,440
when circuit boards are a construction

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
material their shape and the ways in

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
which they connect determine the form

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,080
and function of the final project

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,920
this talk will show several different

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,160
kinds of modular circuit board designs

65
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,040
created by me as well as other makers

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,920
i

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,160
i frequently post new builds online

68
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,640
under the screen name geekbomb projects

69
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,440
and my motto is leds improve everything

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
my projects obviously reflect that

71
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,640
philosophy

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,319
as these pictures show

73
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,120
a lot of my led projects are wearables

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,160
i first learned to design pcbs because i

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,400
wanted to create my own led wearables

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,879
product line called bright wearables

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,120
and in that process i designed and

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,159
manufactured an led accessory board for

79
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,280
the micro microcontroller which attaches

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,680
with snaps to the interior of specially

81
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,920
designed bags and backpacks

82
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,599
that's the idea that got me started with

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,400
pcbs but i keep finding new ways to use

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,360
them in my projects so

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
the next few slides show

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,319
modular pcb assemblies from a few other

87
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,080
makers

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,879
there are no established rules or best

89
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,040
practice techniques for creating modular

90
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,280
pcb assemblies the concept can be

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,920
applied in a number of ways the two

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,799
project projects shown here

93
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,760
are kits consisting of pcb panels

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,560
where the pcbs in the panel have

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
different shapes and functions the cat

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,040
lamp kit at left

97
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
in the pcbs

98
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,440
in the panel are organically shaped with

99
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
plated slots that solder together

100
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,640
directly

101
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,519
some of the pcb elements form the lamp's

102
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,680
electronic circuit but others only

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,480
provide structure or decoration

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,959
the hack mod wear kit was created by

105
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,599
marietta west and angela sheehan who

106
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,080
both have wonderful amazing individual

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,319
maker projects online

108
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,239
they designed this kit for super con

109
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,680
2018

110
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,279
and the pcb elements are designed to be

111
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,600
separated and assembled into wearables

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
the elements have different shapes and

113
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,520
components like leds sensors and

114
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,280
processors and you can create

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,639
arrangements with different looks and

116
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,639
functions by using different subsets of

117
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,639
this kit

118
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,040
on this next slide the projects are a

119
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,759
different kind of modular pcb build

120
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,520
they are designed

121
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,800
and assembled from many identical pcb

122
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,759
base elements these designs work by

123
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,880
assembling simple pcbs into larger

124
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,199
interesting geometric shapes that come

125
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,040
together and feel much greater than the

126
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,759
sum of their pcb building blocks

127
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,720
on the left daniel hinch's icosahedron

128
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,680
build uses two different shapes of pcbs

129
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
the red pentagons have a neopixel in

130
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,400
their center and are the vertices of an

131
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,840
icosahedron

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,400
while the longer boards form the edges

133
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,479
the addressable led signal

134
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,479
travels along the soldered edges through

135
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,639
a carefully mapped path that reaches

136
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,120
each led exactly once

137
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,720
the lamp on the right

138
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
by twitter maker

139
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,800
eric boseman who goes as brain smoke

140
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
online

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,880
connects irregularly shaped pcbs into a

142
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,560
near sphere

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
that has

144
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,440
circular holes which are pretty

145
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,960
impressive because they're made from

146
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
cutouts in the side the design is

147
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
amazing so i'm seeing how cool these

148
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,800
aluminum pc builds

149
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,880
aluminum pcbs look in this build has

150
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,240
convinced me that i'm going to have to

151
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,960
try out aluminum pcbs sometimes but note

152
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,520
that in both these builds the final form

153
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,080
is fixed it's predetermined by the

154
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,919
shapes of the individual boards which

155
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,240
are directly soldered together

156
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,039
so

157
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,199
my inspiration to make a modular circuit

158
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,759
board system came from seeing nanoleaf

159
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,400
light tiles these are

160
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,479
like i said light tiles which attach to

161
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,400
a wall in different configurations and

162
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,199
display colorful changing light patterns

163
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,039
many manufacturers have copied this

164
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,759
project product and many makers have

165
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,360
been inspired to create their own

166
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,400
versions if you google diy nano leaf

167
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,639
tiles you'll find many different

168
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,880
creative ways to build similar displays

169
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,919
so

170
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,080
i'm innately drawn to changeable art

171
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,880
especially if it has leds but i found it

172
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,440
hard to justify buying myself a set of

173
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,319
tiles because i already have so many led

174
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,400
strips and strings at home

175
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,479
i set about trying to make my own

176
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,160
version instead

177
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,440
it turns out

178
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,319
that

179
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,479
most of my modular builds which you'll

180
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,639
see in this some of which you'll see in

181
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,000
this presentation

182
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,919
um have a lot of common elements with

183
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,160
the nano leaf tiles which makes sense

184
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
because they're intended as art and the

185
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,400
traits here are qualities i usually try

186
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,520
to incorporate in my modular designs so

187
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,919
first off i usually use identical base

188
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,919
circuit boards in my project because

189
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,639
it's simpler to design and usually more

190
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,759
flexible

191
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,680
to rearrange the elements

192
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,599
the circuits themselves are simple again

193
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,000
because it's easier complexity comes

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,759
from the way in which the circuit boards

195
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,000
are assembled or programmed

196
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
the pcvs

197
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,759
are self-connecting because i prefer to

198
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,520
minimize the number of different parts

199
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
in a build and the builds just tend to

200
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,720
look cleaner that way i like easily

201
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,680
reconfigurable projects because your

202
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,759
taste change and i think it's fun to be

203
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,479
able to rearrange your art to match

204
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,560
they're scalable because i want to be

205
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,319
able to use the same base elements for a

206
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,160
small project or a big project i like

207
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,599
that flexibility

208
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,800
and of course

209
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
leds my goal is always blinky bright

210
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,080
colorful and attractive builds because

211
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
that's my aesthetic

212
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,879
now

213
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,319
of course making custom b pcb projects

214
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,639
requires that you design your own pcbs

215
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,120
which i initially found intimidating now

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,039
that i have more experience i thought

217
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,759
i'd share my secrets to low stress pcb

218
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,080
projects and i swear this slide is not

219
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
just an excuse to work a dr strangelove

220
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,720
joke into my talk but that was a bonus

221
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,520
i really hope to encourage more novice

222
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,599
makers to learn circuit board design

223
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,000
because it's such a powerful tool

224
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,240
and to have in your maker toolbox this

225
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,560
one single element can provide your

226
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,360
build with electronics aesthetics and

227
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,039
mechanical support

228
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,679
so it's easy to make mistakes when

229
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,760
designing and ordering circuit boards

230
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,679
and i used to worry about wasting time

231
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,880
and money

232
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,399
circuit board design software has a

233
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,320
steep learning curve and the process of

234
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,800
ordering boards is confusing so here's

235
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
my secret to overcoming the fear of

236
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,399
making mistakes with pcbs

237
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,399
first start by reading tutorials on how

238
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,519
to design them i found the spark fun

239
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,839
tutorials on using eagle cad very

240
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,680
helpful when i got started

241
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,640
second

242
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,800
review your designs carefully

243
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,959
have a friend check them send them off

244
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,120
place an order don't sweat the details

245
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,720
because it's the third step here that's

246
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,160
critical inevitably you'll make mistakes

247
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,000
but you'll also find those mistakes are

248
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,680
rarely a big deal

249
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,480
you can order small prototype pcb runs

250
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,200
cheaply if you find some mistakes use it

251
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,399
as a learning opportunity

252
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,399
revise the design and redo the order

253
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,880
it's not that expensive to experiment

254
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
i felt better about making so many

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
mistakes when an experienced circuit

256
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
board maker told me that sometimes even

257
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,720
his orders came back only functional as

258
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,000
coasters so most pcbs you see in builds

259
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,760
have been redesigned and tested through

260
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,360
several iterations they're rarely

261
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,320
perfect the first time so ultimately the

262
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
trick to low stress pcb projects is

263
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
simply not to stress and just try out

264
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,200
your ideas to see what happens i have

265
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,880
learned more from my mistakes than my

266
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,760
successes and i have a bonus collection

267
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,200
of really weird shaped coasters now

268
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
so

269
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,959
this slide shows how some of my previous

270
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,279
projects contributed to the design of

271
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,320
the pcb based light tiles i had built a

272
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
series of what i called inner glow

273
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,519
projects that embed an led strip

274
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,880
sideways into laser-cut acrylic sheet

275
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,040
the leds shine directly into the plane

276
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,519
of the acrylic the three projects on the

277
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,760
left use that technique

278
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,320
these projects which place the leds

279
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,959
inside the acrylic gave me the idea of

280
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,120
how to design the light tiles

281
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,880
the base layer of a tile is a pcb with

282
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,440
side emitting leds covered with a layer

283
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,079
of laser-cut translucent acrylic the

284
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,800
leds shine directly into the acrylic

285
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,720
which diffuses their light

286
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,120
now the pictures on the right show views

287
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,279
of the final tile assemblies which i

288
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,000
made using both triangular and hexagonal

289
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
tiles you can see how the inner glow

290
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,920
effect worked out

291
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,320
each tile polygon has one led at each

292
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,440
corner pointed towards the tile's center

293
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,920
the hexagon leds diffused more uniformly

294
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,320
than the triangles probably because they

295
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,440
contain twice as many leds although and

296
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,240
the non-uniformity of the triangle tiles

297
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,399
is actually more pronounced on camera

298
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,720
than it is in real life and even so

299
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,560
it creates a pretty effect

300
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,720
and it is also actually dependent on the

301
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,079
brightness at which you run the leds um

302
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,760
so it still looks nice even if it's not

303
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,839
perfect

304
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,440
diffusion the circuitry in the light

305
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,160
tiles is extremely simple this schematic

306
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,000
shows all the components in a triangle

307
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,640
tile three addressable leds three

308
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,560
decoupling capacitors and three

309
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,600
connectors i included this top this

310
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,480
slide to show you that you don't need to

311
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,000
be an electronics wiz to make

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,040
interesting pcbs super simple circuits

313
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,000
can produce great results

314
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,279
so

315
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,519
i made a few different prototypes of the

316
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,000
tile pcbs so their appearance may differ

317
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,079
in some pictures but

318
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,760
these this version here in the upper

319
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,480
left have a solder mask story

320
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,120
these light tiles work best with a white

321
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,000
surface on the top to reflect any

322
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
downward directed light back into the

323
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,720
acrylic when i ordered them

324
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,320
white solder mask was more expensive

325
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,560
than black but happily it turns out that

326
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,279
like white silk screen is free so these

327
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,440
tiles actually have black solder mask

328
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,519
with a top surface almost completely

329
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,839
covered in white silk screen

330
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,160
i did my own assembly using the fancy

331
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,240
skillet you see in the bottom row

332
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,920
surface mount soldering with an

333
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,079
inexpensive electric skillet is a neat

334
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,000
trick i learned from another sparkfun

335
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,120
tutorial

336
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
it's a great way for makers who are new

337
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
to the process to assemble their own

338
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,760
surface mount pcbs i've since upgraded

339
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,480
to a reflow hot plate but absolutely

340
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,160
recommend the skillet method if you're

341
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,480
just getting started

342
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,240
i called out this

343
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
sk6812

344
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,360
4020 side illuminating led because i

345
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,760
have a love-hate relationship with them

346
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
side illumination is a really really

347
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,839
great way to let you view the led's

348
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,000
colors without

349
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,079
it getting overwhelmed by the blinding

350
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,040
glare but these leds have teeny tiny

351
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,680
pads and are a big challenge to solder

352
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
so consider yourself warned if you

353
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,720
decide

354
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,560
to use them

355
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,760
once i had working pcbs i laser cut

356
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,000
translucent acrylic for the top layer

357
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,040
with cutouts at the position of the leds

358
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,120
and capacitors so it could sit flush

359
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,800
against the top layer of the circuit

360
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,680
board

361
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,079
and nylon screws hold the layers

362
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,720
together and blend in nicely visually

363
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,399
with the white acrylic

364
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,760
and this is how

365
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,160
i made the individual light tiles

366
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,839
it was a bigger challenge to connect

367
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,160
them together but before i get into that

368
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,920
i'm going to digress for just a moment

369
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,720
so

370
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,800
since i'm advocating

371
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,600
using pcbs as a construction material i

372
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
feel like i should be able to tell you

373
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,920
whether it's cost effective so i did

374
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,839
some simple math

375
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,680
pcvs and acrylic are the two main

376
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
components of the light tiles and cover

377
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,839
the same surface area so it's reasonable

378
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,079
to compare their cost for tile the

379
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,600
calculations here

380
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,160
use retail prices for the acrylic i used

381
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
and pcbs

382
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,760
minus shipping and tax

383
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,040
so at left

384
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,760
we see that cutting 33 acrylic tiles

385
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,480
efficiently laid out on a 12 by 24 inch

386
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,399
sheet of translucent acrylic cost about

387
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,440
54 cents per tile for materials only

388
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,839
and on the right um it turns out that

389
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,320
ordering 50 lead-free circuit boards

390
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
with black solder mask from jlc pcb

391
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,160
averaged 84 cents a tile which is a

392
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,399
little over 50 more per tile for the

393
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,320
pcbs than the acrylic

394
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,279
but

395
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,440
the pcb cost will drop at higher

396
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,760
quantities and if i didn't own a laser

397
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,199
cutter i'd have to pay to have the

398
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,920
acrylic laser cut while the pcbs arrive

399
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
fully cut and drilled with whatever

400
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,720
customizable silk screen artwork i want

401
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,199
at no extra cost so

402
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,279
i think that if we're going to examine

403
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,519
the cost effectiveness hypothesis of

404
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,839
pcbs as a construction material

405
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,199
i would call it confirmed

406
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,440
so now back to the tile construction

407
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
as i said before connecting the tiles

408
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,279
was the hardest part though that's not

409
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,199
unique to this project

410
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,959
i find that in most of my builds the

411
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,040
biggest challenge is figuring out how to

412
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,120
connect and hold everything together

413
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,800
i wanted the light tail assemblies to be

414
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,320
reconfigurable so they couldn't be

415
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,399
soldered together directly i needed to

416
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,560
find a connector and the first step was

417
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,639
to figure out what i needed

418
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,040
i identified these characteristics

419
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
mechanical strength

420
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,120
because unlike the real nano leaf tiles

421
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,199
which used a wall for support i wanted

422
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,440
my build to be freestanding

423
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,079
electrically the led data signals needed

424
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,160
to travel through a long chain of

425
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,720
connections in a potentially very large

426
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,120
assembly and for safety reasons i didn't

427
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,680
want exposed power contacts

428
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,600
aesthetics were really important because

429
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,680
this is functional art i wanted

430
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,320
unobtrusive low profile connectors and

431
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,680
they also had to be surface mount

432
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,839
because any through-hole parts would

433
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,000
stop the acrylic sitting flush against

434
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,440
the circuit board

435
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,279
affordability is important because of

436
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,360
the sheer quantities of connectors

437
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,680
required each edge of each tile has a

438
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,320
connector and there are many tiles in a

439
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,920
large assembly

440
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,000
and part availability is a bigger issue

441
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,680
now than it was at the time but even

442
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,240
then i didn't want parts that would be

443
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
obscure or hard to get

444
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,480
so with these criteria established i

445
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
started to search and

446
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,639
became intimately familiar with the

447
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,480
board to board connector categories on

448
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,360
mauser and digikey there were a lot of

449
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,839
potential candidates to sift through

450
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,759
and you'll have to humor me for another

451
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,040
brief digression because when i was

452
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,959
writing up this portion of the talk

453
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,000
um

454
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,320
it struck me that

455
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,920
the connector search was actually

456
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,400
starting to sound a lot like dating so

457
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,559
briefly these are the similarities i

458
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,160
noticed

459
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,079
with so many possible candidates it

460
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,599
really feels like it should be easier to

461
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,919
find the right one

462
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,919
second when you're searching online an

463
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,640
effective filter is very helpful

464
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,039
and the biggest similarity to dating is

465
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,799
that you start out with like certain

466
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,720
ideals in your mind and take a good hard

467
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,319
look at what's available

468
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,919
and realize pretty soon that they're

469
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,360
gonna be some compromises so

470
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,039
back to the connectors

471
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,520
i did consider a lot of candidates and

472
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,400
none were perfect you could potentially

473
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,720
apply dating metaphors to this slide as

474
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,160
well

475
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,320
the connectors shown here were actually

476
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,400
among the sturdiest i could find

477
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,840
but none of them could support a

478
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,000
vertical column of pcb light tiles by

479
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,679
themselves and most of them were

480
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,120
expensive

481
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
the one actually that came closest to

482
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,400
meeting all my criteria was surprisingly

483
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,480
also the simplest and cheapest

484
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,240
surface mount header pins

485
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,120
were

486
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,039
easily available flexible enough to

487
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,440
survive a bit of stress but still not

488
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,400
strong enough on their own so in the end

489
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,799
i created my own connector by designing

490
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,960
a second circuit board you see here

491
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,080
the fiberglass cores of pcbs make them

492
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,400
good structural reinforcements

493
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,679
um on these connector pcbs power and

494
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,520
signal pass through small pressure

495
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,799
connectors

496
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,120
um

497
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,039
that have little spring-loaded prongs

498
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,320
that can move up or down

499
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,679
i chose pressure connectors over header

500
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,480
pins because they require fewer parts

501
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,880
since header pins work in header socket

502
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,520
pairs while the complement to a pressure

503
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,240
connector can be a simple solder pad

504
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,720
which is basically free so the pressure

505
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,120
connectors were also lower profile and

506
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,200
had a smaller footprint to keep them

507
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,120
from getting squished there's a laser

508
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,320
cut 1 16 inch layer of clear acrylic

509
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,880
with cutouts on the connector side of

510
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,600
the pcb and in the assembly what i

511
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,120
really liked is that these connectors

512
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,559
these custom connectors completely

513
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,960
covered the contacts so electronics were

514
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,799
not exposed

515
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,840
and

516
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,679
this

517
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
video

518
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,440
shows the tile assembly is running some

519
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,760
simple animations i want to point out

520
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,039
that the stand

521
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,960
the stands for these structures

522
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,840
uh

523
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,120
are just wooden versions of the pcb

524
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,400
light tiles

525
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
that i laser cut with slots so they

526
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,600
could be cross braced perpendicularly so

527
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,919
these cross braced bottom layer of

528
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,880
wooden tiles are just attached to the

529
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,200
bottom row of light tiles in the same

530
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,559
method as the light tells attached to

531
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,520
each other

532
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
and they make a really nice adaptable

533
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,679
actually pretty good looking base

534
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,840
so

535
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,120
it worked really nicely but it wasn't

536
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,720
perfect

537
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,120
and as usual the connections

538
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,640
were the issue

539
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,000
the larger assemblies had some

540
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
mechanical issues mostly because of

541
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
torque from the combined weight of the

542
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,640
tiles there was some sagging in the

543
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
plane of the tiles and also what was

544
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
worse was that the bending perpendicular

545
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,000
to the plane of the tiles could

546
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,320
sometimes be enough to lift the pressure

547
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,039
connectors completely off the contacts

548
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,679
so i think that tighter tolerances and

549
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,000
smaller gaps between tiles

550
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
would help future builds to show up the

551
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,600
existing build i laser cut some

552
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,240
some small acrylic clear acrylic shims

553
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,400
to just slide between the tiles

554
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,480
and added extra laser-cut acrylic

555
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,760
connectors

556
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,440
for extra support

557
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
tightening the screws helped with

558
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,600
electrical connections and in future

559
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,760
designs i think it would be a good idea

560
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,080
to place the electrical contact points

561
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,840
as near to the screws in the connectors

562
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,679
as possible and maybe even add some more

563
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,919
screws to really hold things together

564
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,280
tightly

565
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,760
electrically um this is probably a

566
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,679
novice mistake but i really hadn't

567
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,320
thought enough about power distribution

568
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,480
if you route power in a single line the

569
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,720
voltage drops significantly by the end

570
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,760
of the tile sequence making leds dimmer

571
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,480
so i added extra power taps to my to my

572
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,960
assemblies but in future revisions it's

573
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,720
best addressed by redesigning the

574
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,280
connectors and without too much detail

575
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,919
the pcb connectors i made um only

576
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,760
attached the input of one tile to the

577
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,440
output of another so they only work

578
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,320
along the signal path it would be better

579
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,559
if they could distribute power between

580
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,480
any adjacent tile edges which would be

581
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,559
most easily accomplished by making all

582
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,880
the pin outs on the edges symmetric at

583
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,200
the connection points like this example

584
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
down here in yellow and that would also

585
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,480
help with safety

586
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,080
because it's harder probably not

587
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,159
impossible but harder to hook symmetric

588
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,880
connections up wrong but despite or

589
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,640
probably because of the challenges of

590
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,480
this build i've really enjoyed having

591
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,039
these displays in my house

592
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,080
so that was the first but not the last

593
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,400
of my modular pcv builds and just to

594
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,720
show that they can't all be winners this

595
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,520
was my attempt at a wearable version of

596
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,919
light tiles

597
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,640
i scaled the project way down

598
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,840
way way down and at this side the only

599
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,440
detachable connectors which fit were

600
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,159
these 1.27 millimeter pitch through-hole

601
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,159
header pins which turned out to be

602
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,000
really difficult to solder

603
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,919
i was able to construct a working

604
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,400
assembly but it was ugly and in the end

605
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,480
i just scavenged the tiles to use in a

606
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,440
wired cuff bracelet project instead

607
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,880
so

608
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,240
i still had

609
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,600
pcb

610
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,159
light tiles left over and wanted to use

611
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,240
them in a three-dimensional build so i

612
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,080
joined eight of the tiles into an

613
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,559
octahedron i 3d printed some screw

614
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,559
brackets to hold the sides together at

615
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,200
the right angles the wiring a gem m0

616
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,679
controller and a lipo battery all fit

617
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,600
inside the octahedron and i didn't need

618
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,679
to make the wiring neat because it's not

619
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,679
visible from the exterior

620
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,080
adjacent tiles in each build half were

621
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,360
soldered together so they couldn't be

622
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,039
reconfigured

623
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,480
but the screw brackets did make them

624
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,520
quite sturdy the two octahedron halves

625
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,640
snap together with neodymium magnets and

626
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,720
the final build has a nice futuristic

627
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,120
look when illuminated and i would really

628
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,440
like to create more 3d pcb light

629
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,840
projects in the

630
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,400
future now this next project

631
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,120
has a bit of a twist pun intended

632
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,960
i couldn't stay away from the idea of

633
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,480
creating modular pcb wearables so i

634
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,559
thought i'd scale up a little and make a

635
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,440
cuff

636
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,400
bracelet a flexible cuff bracelet

637
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
wearable builds are a special challenge

638
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,080
because they need to conform to our

639
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,640
irregular bendy bodies and i wanted a

640
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,720
bendy connector so

641
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,960
i'm not really sure where i got the idea

642
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,559
to use dollhouse hinges because i

643
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,559
certainly did not find them on mauser or

644
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,120
digikey but they're appealing because

645
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,520
they're cheap small and have screw holes

646
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,039
for reinforcement

647
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,440
they're brass which can be soldered so i

648
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
designed a footprint for them then

649
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,159
fabricated small pcbs to use as links in

650
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,760
a cuff bracelet

651
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,799
adjacent links connect with three hinges

652
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,360
for power signal underground each link

653
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,400
has three layers the pcbs sit between a

654
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,799
laser-cut acrylic bezel on top and the

655
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,120
hinges on the bottom layer

656
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,200
wires go through the matching holes in

657
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,120
all three layers for mechanical

658
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
reinforcement so

659
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,640
in this build the side emitting leds

660
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,200
fit inside cutouts in the bezel which i

661
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,919
filled with hot glue for light diffusion

662
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,919
um i covered the exposed back of the

663
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,559
hinges with black tape to insulate it

664
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,880
and make it more comfortable to wear and

665
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,559
as you can see here the aesthetics were

666
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,360
terrific i love the way this looks the

667
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,679
hinges are very low profile making the

668
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,720
bracelet quite thin the assembly flexes

669
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,840
smoothly and easily unfortunately there

670
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,760
were electrical issues

671
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,440
you don't see it in this video but

672
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,840
repeatedly bending the hinges causes

673
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,559
glitches in the led patterns

674
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,360
and after playing around a bit i believe

675
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,720
that it's the friction between the

676
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
hinges and the pins holding them

677
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,279
together

678
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,000
plus having large open metal surfaces

679
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,240
for signal creates interference on the

680
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,559
signal line i did not continue with this

681
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,559
project because i couldn't figure out a

682
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,520
good way to overcome safety issues of

683
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
having a wearable running current

684
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,840
through large regions of exposed metal

685
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,799
also under stress it turns out that the

686
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,039
pins inside the hinges can slip out and

687
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,919
cause shorts which is obviously bad and

688
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,679
even more obviously bad inside a

689
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,760
wearable so while they were fun to play

690
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,600
with i've stopped using them and

691
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
strongly recommend that you don't use

692
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,679
doll house hinges in your electrical

693
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,880
projects just in case you were tempted

694
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,840
but i still did want to find

695
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,400
a way to make a bendable pcb assembly

696
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,159
and tried a different approach

697
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,240
a twitter recommendation pointed me to

698
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,720
these rotating connectors they only cost

699
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,840
about 60 cents a piece have four

700
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,279
circuits and even better they're

701
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,159
actually designed for use with pcbs so

702
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,559
these connectors give a much safer and

703
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,039
more reliable electrical connection

704
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,960
unfortunately i didn't find them that

705
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,640
attractive and wearable and they aren't

706
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,960
very strong mechanically they separate

707
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,360
too easily under stress so a running

708
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,039
theme in this talk is that it's very

709
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,760
difficult to use the same pcb connector

710
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,080
for both electrical connections and

711
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,080
mechanical support

712
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,960
so

713
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,679
next up

714
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,960
more motion

715
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,880
um

716
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,480
this is my

717
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,200
articulated pcb projects also known as

718
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,919
bendy boards it's another moving pcb

719
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,919
assembly but it uses a different

720
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,600
technique

721
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,279
with the hinged builds the boards move

722
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,760
perpendicular to one another

723
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,919
but this design rotates the boards

724
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,760
within the same plane

725
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,159
the full assembly is a chain of pivoting

726
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,360
links

727
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,520
each removable link consists of two

728
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,080
parallel pcbs with holes in the center

729
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,559
that pivot around a common axis provided

730
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,360
by a plastic push rivet the links use

731
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,360
the same pressure connectors as the

732
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,159
light tiles did except in this case the

733
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,080
pressure connectors make contact with a

734
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,159
ring-shaped pad on the surface of a

735
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,919
rotating pcb

736
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,960
each ring in the pad each ring on the

737
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,440
pcb makes contact with two pressure

738
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,600
connectors on the other board in the

739
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,080
link and this redundancy helps maintain

740
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,600
the connection in case there's a bit of

741
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,720
wobble

742
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,399
just like with the light tiles there is

743
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,799
a buffer layer of acrylic

744
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,240
to keep the pressure connectors from

745
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,760
getting crushed

746
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,440
the other connector in this design is a

747
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,279
small mezzanine connector which joins

748
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,159
links together detachably two m2 screws

749
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,760
on either side provide additional

750
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
mechanical reinforcement to keep the

751
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,039
links together

752
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,880
it was a fiddly

753
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,640
iterative design process to get all the

754
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,720
tolerances right but the result is

755
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,559
actually remarkably sturdy and doesn't

756
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,720
glitch even with a lot of handling

757
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,880
i'm really fond of this project though i

758
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,480
haven't found a good purpose for it

759
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
other than a fidget toy

760
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,480
but i'm still thinking about ways i

761
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,399
could use this design as a practical

762
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,720
technique for flexing

763
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,000
other design circuit board designs

764
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,520
so

765
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,120
fortunately i have a little time left

766
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,080
because

767
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,760
we're

768
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,840
at the last project of my talk

769
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,760
and this one is fun because i'm still

770
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,000
right in the middle of it i have not yet

771
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,159
explored its full potential i haven't

772
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,159
even shown it publicly before because i

773
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,120
couldn't i only just recently finished

774
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,600
assembling a few of the pcbs and here

775
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,440
they are

776
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,600
the left side shows the unpopulated

777
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
boards and the ones on the right show

778
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,840
that when populated they contain two

779
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,240
addressable leds decoupling capacitors

780
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,480
header pins male and female

781
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,559
and very short header pins male and

782
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,039
female

783
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,000
and a double pull double throw slide

784
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,679
switch and the function will become

785
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,440
clearer shortly

786
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,799
this was the first prototype of this

787
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,240
design and there was a significant

788
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,960
mistake but

789
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,039
after a lot of unnecessary

790
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,960
i won't explain it but

791
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,640
basically in the end it's the silk

792
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,480
screen is on the wrong side so which is

793
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,080
fine as long as you're really really

794
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
careful about knowing which is voltage

795
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,600
and ground

796
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,200
so by themselves these boards aren't

797
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
very exciting but when you put them

798
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,159
together things start to get fun

799
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,120
these le boards led boards are another

800
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,520
light tile project but instead of the

801
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,080
pcb forming the face of the tile these

802
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,919
little circuit boards form the sides

803
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,960
instead so this is how it works

804
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,080
the castilated edges of these pcbs can

805
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,159
be soldered soldered together at any

806
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,919
angle which means you can make a light

807
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,240
tile in any shape with as many sides as

808
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,559
you want as long as all sides have the

809
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,720
same length so the same

810
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,679
base

811
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,039
pcbs

812
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,320
can create

813
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,679
a variety

814
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,559
of

815
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,600
shape tiles to hold the configuration in

816
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,000
place the tile faces are just laser-cut

817
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,559
translucent acrylic with slots to hold

818
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,520
the tabs at the sides of the pcbs

819
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,760
the acrylic diffuses the led light and

820
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,080
also doubles as a jig for soldering the

821
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,919
castellated edges which is a nice

822
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,120
efficiency

823
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,360
using translucent acrylic on both sides

824
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,200
of the tile gives you a two-sided

825
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,679
display or placing mirrored acrylic on

826
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,440
one side just gives you a brighter glow

827
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,799
on the other

828
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,799
i left holes in the acrylic to use

829
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,799
standoffs to help hold each tile

830
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,200
together and the slide switches on each

831
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
side determine whether that side is an

832
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,960
input or output and it's designed to

833
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,720
work no matter how many sides are in the

834
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,880
shape so in any tile

835
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,640
one side gets set as input and the rest

836
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
is outputs

837
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,840
um and i'm running short on time i'm

838
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,360
going to count on the fact that i have i

839
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,960
think a minute or two of overage because

840
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,320
i'm close

841
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,080
so i've only had time to make a few

842
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,159
working triangle and square tiles but i

843
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,440
have plans for different shapes and

844
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
there are a lot of possibilities as long

845
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
as you place slots in the acrylic which

846
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,840
correspond to the pcb tabs it's pretty

847
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,919
easy to assemble so

848
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,279
um

849
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,880
all right

850
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,880
i know i'm getting closer so once you've

851
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,880
built the blocks all you have to do is

852
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,720
slide the header bins together and voila

853
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,279
you have a rearrangeable modular

854
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,240
assembly of modular pcb assemblies and i

855
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,760
have some additional ideas to try with

856
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,279
these blocks because the holes and the

857
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,559
pcbs

858
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,799
you see right here allow adjacent tiles

859
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,679
to be reinforced with standoffs or you

860
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,679
could put magnets in there and um use

861
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,159
pogo pins to make snappable magnetic

862
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,679
light tiles which i think would be fun

863
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,760
so all of this is going to be future

864
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
experimentation because magnets like

865
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,760
leds make everything better and just to

866
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
wrap it up because i know i'm really

867
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,360
getting close to

868
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,200
going over

869
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,880
i hope that you see that there's a lot

870
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,120
to be done with modular tile assemblies

871
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,960
and that pcbs make a terrific

872
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,039
construction material for projects they

873
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,440
also make good diy connectors when you

874
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,360
can't find an existing connector you

875
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,679
like remember never to use dollhouse

876
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,039
hinges

877
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,279
as connectors and i hope that somebody

878
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,200
watching this talk will be inspired to

879
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,360
go out and try using pcbs in a way they

880
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,880
haven't thought of before

881
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,840
thank you very much
