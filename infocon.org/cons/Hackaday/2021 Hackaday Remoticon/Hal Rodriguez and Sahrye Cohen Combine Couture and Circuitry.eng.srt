1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,120
well welcome back again uh

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,200
we're our next speakers created the

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,920
fashion at tech studio amped antelio as

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,920
a way to explore modern fabrication

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,280
techniques and interactivity and

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,000
clothing through medium of wearable art

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,080
which is of particular interest to me if

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,560
anybody if any of you know me i hope you

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,640
all enjoy their talk as much as i will i

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,599
welcome

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,960
sarai cohen and how rodriguez as they

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,279
share details about conductive melody a

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,399
texture instrument

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,200
well welcome we're really excited to be

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,360
able to talk about our piece conductive

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,320
melody i'm sorry and this is hal um

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,960
together we have a little wearable tech

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,280
couture design studio called and a

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,520
player

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,800
um

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,920
so we started this piece in 2019

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000
as part of make fashion which is a group

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,680
out of calgary

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,079
and this is for a presentation at beaker

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,680
head which is the science and art and

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,199
music festival in calgary

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,200
one of the things that we like to create

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,479
are

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,840
wearable garments that have

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,680
interactivity so

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,759
um both of these examples i have up here

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,360
on the screen are

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,439
um one is a piece that has a color

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,520
sensor so the model can

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,600
change the color of the lights in the

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,479
garment they're 3d printed lights and

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,840
she can change that with the color

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,720
sensor using um different objects and

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
then on the right hand side is

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,880
a piece that we made for a dancer that

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,360
has an accelerometer and

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
she's controlling the speed and the

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,400
color and the

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,479
action of the lights on this garment

45
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,640
through her dance moves so

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,680
um

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,840
it's kind of really important to us that

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,159
the garments we make are not just pretty

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,079
flashy lights although that's fun too

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,159
but they can be controlled by the person

51
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,600
that's wearing them or they can be

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,840
controlled by you know

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,040
sensors that interact with the

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,439
environment or even the audience so some

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,759
of the pieces we make have bluetooth and

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,680
they can be controlled by the audience

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,639
as well

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,318
so when we were thinking about this

59
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,120
design and thinking about how to make a

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,520
essentially wearable instrument so i

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,640
like to

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,040
play around with electronics and

63
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,520
make garments and do costuming and how

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
really like synthesizers

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,000
and kind of electronic music

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,160
and we were thinking about what are some

67
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
examples of

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,519
um

69
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
essentially musical instruments and and

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,319
how we could fit those onto a garment um

71
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,599
so one of the things i was thinking of

72
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,080
were hearts you know large strength

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,920
instruments and

74
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,840
this is an example of a historical

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,040
garment um kind of medieval

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
poupons and other kinds of garments that

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,879
have really large sleeves and that would

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,440
give us plenty of room to do kind of a

79
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,200
conductive fabric interface for this

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
and then other examples that we can look

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,560
at are pianos which also have kind of a

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,879
keyboard that you can touch and then

83
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,959
kind of strings extending from that with

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,959
hammers that are making the the musical

85
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,000
notes and um kimonos that have also very

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,159
large sleeves that provide a lot of

87
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,120
space to make this interface um there's

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,920
been some wearable instruments that are

89
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,000
kind of drum kits um there's a drum

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,920
hoodie that people have made

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,680
and other kinds of ones but i wanted to

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,560
make sure that there was enough room

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,080
um for

94
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,440
the

95
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,120
the wearer to really demonstrate that

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,879
they were playing that instrument

97
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,599
and also to be able to kind of make it a

98
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,680
performance so they're performing the

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,360
music and they're performing the garment

100
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,680
so i start all of my pieces by

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,840
essentially doing a design sketch

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,760
um some of these are rougher than others

103
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,959
you can see on the right that there's

104
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,040
one that's basically just like a

105
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,840
humanoid shape that has kind of ideas of

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,760
what this garment might look like and

107
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
usually if it's a piece that we're going

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
to make i develop it into

109
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,760
more of a

110
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,599
a complete design sketch so on the on

111
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,040
the left hand side i have an example

112
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,439
that would kind of use a kimono inspired

113
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,439
sleeve with these metallic

114
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,120
kind of scrolly baroque or floral

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,680
interface that i wanted to use

116
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,160
for the where to do the interactive

117
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,479
music

118
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,720
and then as i produce a piece i

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,759
typically do a mock-up um for those who

120
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,759
make wearables or garments this is

121
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,320
typically called a muslin it uses a very

122
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
thin cotton fabric

123
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,479
um and it's intended to you know just

124
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,800
see how the garment might fit i do this

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,280
through a combination of drafting using

126
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,680
measurements from the body and then also

127
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,720
draping

128
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,840
so here i've made a piece that has you

129
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,280
know a sleeve

130
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,520
a bodice and a skirt and then because i

131
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,720
wanted to make it a little bit different

132
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
than some of the dress type garments

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,759
that we've made before i added some

134
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,840
leggings um to kind of give it a

135
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,400
different look

136
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,120
and then as that comes together i

137
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800
usually choose fabrics

138
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
one of the things that i really like to

139
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,120
do for my garments for like tech couture

140
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,440
is to use couture techniques and

141
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,919
materials so for example this garment is

142
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,520
made out of silk

143
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,840
um i just think that it helps you know

144
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,320
when you're gonna do a one-off creation

145
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,840
it really helps to pay attention to

146
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,680
those details and another design

147
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
style that i like is to kind of hide my

148
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,360
electronic components

149
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
so in the center here there's a

150
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,560
semi-shear net peas with sequins and

151
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,680
beating

152
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
and and some of my electronic components

153
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,039
for my lights are going to go behind

154
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,280
that

155
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,199
here's an example of the couture

156
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
techniques that i use inside the garment

157
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,120
i find that this helps them wear better

158
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
and just makes a more beautiful and

159
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
complete project i've

160
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,840
found the seam allowances and bias

161
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,720
i have a netting piece that contains

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,639
the light strands that i'm going to use

163
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,639
and that's sewn onto

164
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,960
the other the main garment so they can

165
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,039
be removable um definitely something i

166
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,520
think about a lot in making wearables is

167
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,280
how will this be worn how will it be

168
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,560
washed

169
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,759
how can somebody care for it

170
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
one of the materials that we really like

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,360
to use are

172
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
conductive fabrics tapes and thread um

173
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,440
so i made conductive pom-poms

174
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,360
um all sorts of sewn garments that have

175
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,720
conductive thread for this i wanted the

176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,520
conductive interface to be very large

177
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,639
and i used a conductive fabric this was

178
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,000
you know fairly easily acquired it has i

179
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,840
believe steel woven through it and it's

180
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,600
colored copper

181
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,720
and

182
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,960
it is a mostly a polyester fabric so

183
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,599
what i did was i bound the fabric with

184
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,919
heat n bond and that has an adhesive on

185
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,919
both sides so it binds the conductive

186
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,680
fabric to the silk

187
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
and then using design software

188
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,319
illustrator we drew these kind of

189
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,039
organic almost art nouveau

190
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,880
interfaces that

191
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,120
kind of replicate the strings of a harp

192
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,400
and then cut them out on the laser

193
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,280
cutter

194
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,120
and then bonded them onto the silk and

195
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
so this is what formed kind of the

196
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,960
interface the conductive fabric

197
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,239
interface for our instrument

198
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,840
yeah

199
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,240
so this is what's going on in the dress

200
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,520
we have

201
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,560
as sorry i mentioned that the

202
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,960
essentially the the main

203
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,120
uh interface the main control area is

204
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,319
the sleeve

205
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,599
and the sleeve is uh

206
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,560
the

207
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,759
copper looking fabric is is

208
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,400
basically sensed by a

209
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,479
capacitive time solution we're using i

210
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,440
think a

211
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,840
breakout board made by i think adafruit

212
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
uh and it all communicates the touch is

213
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,000
all communicated to a small arduino the

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,840
small arduino controls the lights on the

215
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,800
dress

216
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,319
so as as notes are played

217
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,759
you'll start to see

218
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,520
you'll see the lights all light up in

219
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,639
sync with the pen because they're

220
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,319
they're responding basically to the

221
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,599
touch as well

222
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,039
uh there's lights on both the front and

223
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
the back of the dress and that's all

224
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,160
controlled by arduino which actually

225
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,319
lives in the sleeve

226
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,240
now the the um

227
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,479
the machine so we're also we're also

228
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,240
turning the 8

229
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,039
the 8th century little strips

230
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,440
into a wider range by extending against

231
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,400
the music by using a raspberry pi

232
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,360
running

233
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,039
a machine learning model put out by

234
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,360
tensorflow project magenta called

235
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,679
pianogene the pianogne essentially takes

236
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,760
eight inputs and expands that out

237
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,519
musically into what you encode would be

238
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,800
an 88 piano keyboard

239
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
the output from that from the raspberry

240
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,360
pi is essentially uh originally we were

241
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,680
using audio but this time we decided to

242
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,640
actually pump out to midi

243
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
the idea is that we'll have um rather

244
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,200
than relying on wireless mics we'll rely

245
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
on bluetooth midi or another kind of

246
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,120
midi over the air to basically have a

247
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,040
standalone dress that can be performed

248
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,440
the raspberry pi is actually hidden in

249
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,720
the ruffles

250
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
of the dress in the back

251
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,880
uh everything's powered by just a good

252
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,399
old um

253
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,880
uh phone battery and it seems to work

254
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,279
fine so uh to get if people are a little

255
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,200
bit interesting to see what goes on

256
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
underneath essentially the raspberry pi

257
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,040
is running magenta uh using a javascript

258
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,360
library so we're running it within a

259
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,080
node app and all that basically happened

260
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,480
there is it's reading in serial from the

261
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,800
arduino uh just essentially byte data

262
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
because we have eight eight control

263
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,240
eight little individual controls so it's

264
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,720
coming in as a byte we tran we we parse

265
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
that out we run it through pianogenie to

266
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,959
take a input from one of the buttons to

267
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,800
actually get a midi note

268
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,000
and then that gets output as midi so the

269
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,200
the fun thing about that is that the um

270
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,279
if we hit a particular note

271
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,560
you'll you'll hear that it's essentially

272
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,720
not the same note every time

273
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
it'll change

274
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
uh and that's essentially the model

275
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,560
which has been trained on uh

276
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,480
on classical music pieces to actually

277
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,880
expand that melody expand those eight

278
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,399
buttons into something that is actually

279
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,600
a little sounds a little bit more

280
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,800
melodic

281
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,079
uh and i think we would like to do a

282
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,519
little demo

283
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,279
so we're gonna we're gonna

284
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,640
we're gonna stop screen sharing

285
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,640
okay

286
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:57,680
[Music]

287
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,570
that's

288
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:20,320
[Music]

289
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,000
so one of the things that you'll notice

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
as we play this and i'm going to let it

291
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,880
um

292
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,600
not play for a while is we wanted both a

293
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,399
musical output and kind of a light

294
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,440
output

295
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,200
so that um

296
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
people could

297
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,079
experience this garment both ways both

298
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,760
visually and

299
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,839
through music so if you'll notice i'm

300
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,240
not playing the garment right now and

301
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,760
we're getting kind of more of these

302
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,480
white and yellow tones and the lights

303
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
aren't turning on very quickly

304
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,600
and then as soon as i start playing

305
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,480
we get more of these pink and blue tones

306
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,720
and there's a lot more activity that

307
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,680
happens on the garment

308
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:14,079
[Music]

309
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,200
yeah

310
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
yeah and because it's all middies we

311
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,720
basically uh allowed we basically are

312
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,160
able to switch the instruments on the

313
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,120
fly really easily for example we can

314
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,279
switch to a

315
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,439
another instrument let's try this one

316
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:42,399
[Music]

317
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,079
a cello sound

318
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,839
but that that's all the the magic of

319
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,200
mini

320
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,360
oh and

321
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,860
yeah

322
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,019
[Music]

323
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,200
we could also introduce a

324
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,600
little backing soundtrack as well

325
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:33,559
[Music]

326
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,999
[Music]

327
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,079
yeah all right so some lessons learned

328
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,320
about the construction of this garment

329
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,440
um

330
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,760
uh we've done several things with

331
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,279
conductive fabric

332
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,920
and it does need to be stored carefully

333
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
because you can run into issues where

334
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,079
if you make

335
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,240
parts of the connection too thin

336
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,880
or if you use a silver fabric it might

337
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,160
tarnish and you'll lose some of the

338
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
connectivity

339
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,880
so

340
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,720
it won't be as conductive you might not

341
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
be able to play all parts of your

342
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,040
garment

343
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,360
you want to talk about software issues

344
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,760
um the software the software running a

345
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
raspberry pi were you know the biggest

346
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,680
problem we had initially was getting

347
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,079
good quality sound out of the pie just

348
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,600
relying on the

349
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
the the bill italian audio system the

350
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
raspberry pi gave us sound that was a

351
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,199
little clicky

352
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,680
uh and also uh

353
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,120
we have um

354
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,839
we also decided to move off over to midi

355
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,760
just because we can rely on external

356
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,120
sound modules that can be plugged in

357
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,519
directly into a sound board at a either

358
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,240
like at a show or a fast short or a

359
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,320
music venue

360
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,560
kind of separated just the the music

361
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,040
generation out of the piece just to make

362
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,440
what runs on the dress uh a little bit

363
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,760
more um manageable

364
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,800
uh stable and uh just to leave the dress

365
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
as essentially a controller

366
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,600
um

367
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,120
but yeah i think that's you know it's

368
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
been fun um

369
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,480
uh

370
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,240
yeah i think yeah i think that is our

371
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,199
talk

372
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,440
unless there's anything else um

373
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,519
so thank you very much for listening if

374
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,600
you have any questions about

375
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,040
conductive fabrics or any of the

376
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,240
electronics or music that we used or the

377
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
components that we used for this project

378
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,320
um how we'll be hanging out on the

379
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
discord i'm going to answer some

380
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,920
questions for you

381
