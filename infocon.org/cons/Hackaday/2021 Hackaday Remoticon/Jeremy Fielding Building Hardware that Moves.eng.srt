1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,600
welcome back to the hackaday remoticon

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,440
everyone thank you for uh sticking

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,440
around with us all day i'm really

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,639
excited to be introducing our final

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,960
speaker of the event uh there are

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,240
certainly

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,000
distinctions between people working in

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
software electronics and mechanical

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,480
engineering fields but i think the

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,240
productivity of your average engineer

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,400
has risen so much that it's blurred

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,480
these lines and it means that every one

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,719
of us needs to have cross-disciplinary

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,120
skills and if you're like me and you

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,480
want to level up your mechanical

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,879
engineering skills we are in for a treat

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,120
with our next keynote speaker jeremy

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,879
fielding has been chasing down an

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,280
incredible range of skills useful to

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,520
anyone building hardware i first took

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,360
note of his youtube channel

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,600
early last year when he was turning a

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,680
relatively inexpensive yet beefy

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,320
electric motor into a dynamometer to

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,879
characterize other motors but of late i

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,440
think the buzz on everyone's mind is

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,520
this incredible industrial arm that he

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,320
has built completely from scratch uh

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,000
jeremy calls himself a contraption

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
engineer and i'm excited to hear more

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,880
about how you do the wonderful things

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,040
that you do it is my pleasure to

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,200
introduce hackaday remoticon keynote

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,320
speaker

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,880
jeremy fielding well good evening ladies

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,560
ladies and gentlemen

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,360
i am going to uh go ahead and turn on

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
the screen sharing

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,880
there we go

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,759
okay so as you can see um or as you know

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,000
by this point the topic is building

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,640
hardware that moves and i felt it was

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,920
fitting probably to give you a little

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,079
bit of a background about myself first

45
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,240
and that is i basically i design

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,479
machines that do stuff

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,240
and um

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,280
let me uh

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,640
i got a timer over here that i want to

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,920
get going

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,840
so that could be anything from science

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
experiments all the way up to full-on

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,159
industrial equipment

54
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,680
most of that stuff is not stuff i could

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,880
share with you here but there's one

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,960
project that i have just to give you a

57
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,719
sense of scale

58
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,040
and that's this project i did this about

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,320
three years ago

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,239
and that's me to give you a sense of how

61
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,679
big this pit is

62
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,680
but essentially

63
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,200
the customer was trying to move all of

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,680
this sand to another location and they

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
were driving it with trucks

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,760
quite a long distance so my chief

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,520
engineer said what if we

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
pumped it into this tank turned it into

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,440
a slurry and then sucked it out like a

70
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,520
milkshake pumping it down the line then

71
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,959
we can dry it out when we get into where

72
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,000
we're going

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,080
so long story short that's what all this

74
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,680
is that you see

75
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,519
in the background

76
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,599
go back one there we go all of this

77
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,560
equipment is designed to turn this dirt

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,360
into a milkshake pump it through this

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,680
pumping line here and then send it on

80
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,879
down the line to where it needs to go

81
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,720
saved a whole bunch of money and gas and

82
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
all that good stuff but the idea is that

83
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,640
this is the kind of stuff that i do i

84
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
love making things and when i'm not

85
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,720
doing it at work i'm also doing it at

86
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,319
home so

87
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,760
that's where

88
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,319
the youtube channel comes in so i put my

89
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,000
home page up here not because i wanted

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,159
to show you my page you could find that

91
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,319
but i want to show you this because all

92
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,400
throughout this talk i'm going to be

93
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,680
talking about a lot of things that i've

94
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,840
covered on my youtube channel before

95
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,159
and on everybody's youtube page there is

96
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,319
a i a place right here where you can

97
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,599
search

98
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,920
within a youtube channel so i'm going to

99
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,400
strongly encourage that you go to here

100
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,159
and if you have any follow-up questions

101
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,519
where you want more details about the

102
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,280
things i'm going to be covering

103
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
you'll very likely be able to find a

104
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,159
whole video on that very topic so that's

105
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,319
where you can go go to my home page

106
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,560
click on the little search icon and then

107
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
all of the videos will come up related

108
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,799
to your search

109
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,400
all right so

110
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
this is the latest project from my

111
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,560
youtube channel

112
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,360
it's a full-size industrial robot arm

113
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,120
that i built myself

114
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,760
and uh this was definitely by far the

115
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,000
most difficult project i've ever done in

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,599
my workshop

117
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,599
maybe except the one that i just started

118
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,040
we'll see but this one is pretty hard so

119
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,879
what makes this so challenging is not

120
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,640
just the mechanical build which is where

121
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,120
i feel the strongest it's all of the

122
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,959
electrical design i mean this part of

123
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,199
the project in my opinion was almost as

124
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,000
complicated as the mechanical design and

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,800
so i invested a lot of time in uh

126
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,120
working out the relay logic working out

127
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,840
all the servo controllers their settings

128
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,919
a lot of energy and time went into a

129
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,400
project like this and i think it shows

130
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,240
on my youtube channel so i frequently

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,520
get this question

132
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,960
where do i start

133
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,639
and that's how i decided on the topic

134
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,000
today because

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,840
people see these projects and they say

136
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,000
man i want to do something like that but

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,280
they don't really know where to get

138
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,720
started and

139
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
i'm hoping to close that gap just a

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,080
little bit today

141
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
by talking to you about how to build

142
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,880
things yourself your own ideas your own

143
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,120
designs and i think

144
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
if you're an engineer you have a lot of

145
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,120
tools at your disposal i mean we're

146
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,639
talking about

147
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,880
everything from grabbing your calculator

148
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,560
putting in formulas and doing the math

149
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,919
to figure out if your structure is

150
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,919
strong enough i've got cad tools

151
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,160
available to me i've got reference books

152
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
i can go over here and say hey you know

153
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,639
i can look through a list and find if

154
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
the beam is going to be strong enough

155
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,919
and things like that but if you're

156
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,680
making things at home

157
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,240
not only do you not have those tools for

158
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,479
the most part you don't need them and

159
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,000
what i suggest is that you make

160
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
prototypes

161
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,810
for me

162
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,280
[Music]

163
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,600
one of my favorite prototypes is this if

164
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,360
you go to my youtube channel you'll see

165
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,280
the very first video

166
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,680
is this guy

167
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
when i started my youtube channel i had

168
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,560
no

169
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,400
engineering training at all

170
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,479
so i was literally just making it up as

171
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,320
i go and i didn't know anything about

172
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,880
linkages but you can see this guy has

173
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,960
linkages on it again a project that

174
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,080
moves

175
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,720
what inspired this idea was

176
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,639
i had a really tiny workshop and i

177
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,280
wanted to figure out how do i squeeze

178
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,319
more tools into that little tiny space

179
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,840
and i came up with this idea i said man

180
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
it would be great if i could have a

181
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,440
workbench where i'd have my miter saw uh

182
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,720
not miter saw my um router on one side

183
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,560
and then you could flip it over inside

184
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
the same space and have a little bench

185
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,520
top bandsaw on top so i made this thing

186
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,319
out of wood and i was i even made one

187
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,080
out of cardboard as well which is what

188
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,000
this clip is that you see

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,840
on your screen

190
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,520
this is where i figured out how long the

191
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,199
linkages need to be i knew nothing about

192
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,520
calculating linkages i was just sticking

193
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,199
pins in the cardboard and figuring it

194
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,199
out and so this is the first thing you

195
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,720
need to do

196
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
before you spend a lot of time just

197
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,080
telling yourself i don't know how to do

198
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,960
this

199
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
grab some cardboard grab some pieces of

200
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,360
wood and just start making shapes and

201
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,039
trying to figure it out you'll be

202
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,880
surprised how quickly you can get to a

203
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,840
working prototype if you just grab some

204
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,919
cheek materials and go for it

205
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,520
over here is the only picture i could

206
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,080
find of the actual build this is right

207
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
before i put the bandsaw on it but i

208
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
used that thing for about three years

209
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,800
before i

210
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,160
upgraded the bench and started doing

211
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,759
some different stuff

212
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,000
so

213
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,720
here is another project that was a

214
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,639
similar idea i built this a few months

215
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,960
later i wanted to build my kids a giant

216
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,039
toy box which is what you're looking at

217
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,479
but my kids were really small at the

218
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,160
time and i was concerned about that

219
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,560
heavy wooden lid you know it's falling

220
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,479
on little baby fingers

221
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,400
so i came up with this linkage idea

222
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
which again linkages were already on the

223
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,919
brain

224
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,000
using this linkage allowed me to keep

225
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,199
the lid very low so when they pull on it

226
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,280
it comes down and it stays only a couple

227
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,440
inches above the surface as it comes

228
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,680
down and closes the toy box

229
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,120
again they played with this for a long

230
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
time they got a lot of good use out of

231
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,280
this and i did the same thing with this

232
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,240
i just had one two-dimensional

233
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,400
piece of cardboard i drew out these

234
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,960
linkages on the side and i worked it

235
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,479
until i could close the lid and

236
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,879
cardboard and then i actually built the

237
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,919
structure

238
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,680
later on i went back and added this

239
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
little rod let me see if i can

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,879
turn on my laser pointer here we go

241
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,280
later on i came back and added this

242
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,039
as a support because there was a

243
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,039
position where it would go too far and

244
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,120
lock down at the bottom so this was sort

245
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
of an iteration of the design i put that

246
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,199
little lid on there and then that solved

247
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,440
that problem it never locked in the back

248
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,039
and the kids could open and close it

249
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,520
very easily

250
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,319
so

251
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,200
let's talk about designing a little bit

252
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
first thing you want to do is sketch out

253
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,880
your idea

254
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,839
i don't recommend that you go right out

255
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,159
to your tools and start making stuff

256
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,560
that is a recipe for disaster

257
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,800
in my opinion you should at least draw

258
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,200
out a scale model i always use graphing

259
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,920
paper in fact i keep some right here on

260
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,959
my desk

261
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,519
and then i've also got my ipad which is

262
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,000
a little bit further away from me

263
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,760
and that's what this drawing is so if

264
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,959
you

265
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,680
get my laser pointed back

266
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
here we go

267
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,320
this is a drawing i did for a parabolic

268
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,160
mirror this is a science project that i

269
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,959
was

270
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,200
i had to design a rig

271
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
that would allow us to very carefully

272
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,160
position

273
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,880
a really heavy parabolic mirror

274
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,800
and if you look at the top i just

275
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,160
started sketching i didn't erase

276
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,519
anything i didn't scratch anything

277
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,240
through

278
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,920
i just drew the first iteration then

279
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,160
moved over to the second and kept going

280
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
as i was thinking through how i would

281
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,839
hold on to the mirror how i would mount

282
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,800
it how i would tilt it and the you can

283
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,880
just sort of see the evolution of the

284
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,200
design and i ended up with a square tube

285
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,959
column and some adjustable pieces that

286
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,120
would allow me to slide this thing up

287
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,880
and down

288
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,320
but the thing that i want you to take

289
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,839
away from this is

290
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,920
it can start very crude right like these

291
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,080
are ugly drawings they're not to scale

292
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,760
they don't need to be at this point

293
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
you're just trying to figure out kind of

294
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
what the shape is going to be

295
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
once you have that then i strongly

296
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,200
recommend that you start making it to

297
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,079
scale

298
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,399
so on your graph paper you can

299
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,200
make each block worth a millimeter or a

300
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
centimeter or a foot whatever units you

301
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,640
want to use

302
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,600
and then draw it out to scale

303
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,760
from there you're going to step up and

304
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,839
actually start cutting out some pieces

305
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,680
and again i strongly recommend you make

306
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,000
some kind of prototype either out of

307
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,440
wood

308
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,200
which is really easy to make wood is

309
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,120
easy to cut with very cheap tools it

310
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,640
doesn't cost you very much to get into

311
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,120
woodworking but even cheaper than this

312
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,680
is cardboard and a box cutter and you

313
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,359
can be right on top of it

314
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,880
and oh look at that i left a note on the

315
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,800
screen for me cheap and fast materials

316
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,440
cardboard and wood

317
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,279
another common mistake that i see

318
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,399
beginners make is they make holes size

319
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,720
on size and what that means is if they

320
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,120
expect to put a quarter inch pin inside

321
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,200
of a hole they make the hole a quarter

322
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,000
inch and again that's another recipe for

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,480
problems your holes should always have

324
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,959
some clearance around it now there's a

325
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,959
book you can get

326
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,839
called

327
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,480
the machinery handbook and it goes into

328
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,560
great detail down to thousands of an

329
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,040
inch how big that hole should be to get

330
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,800
the kind of fit that you want

331
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,240
but again if you're not an engineer you

332
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,880
don't need to do that all you need to do

333
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,360
is oversize oversize it a little bit i

334
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
usually just if i don't really care what

335
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,959
the number is and don't care how loose

336
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,360
it is i just go the next drill size up

337
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,600
plunge the hole and keep working and

338
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,279
that's a decent rule of thumb to get

339
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,680
started with as you get further along or

340
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,720
your your precision needs to be higher

341
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,640
then you might need to start thinking in

342
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,000
thousands of an inch to make sure that

343
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
you get the right kind of fit

344
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,600
all right

345
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,560
i'm doing pretty good here

346
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,720
know your raw material dimensions

347
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,440
i bring this up because if you're new to

348
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,639
woodworking or even metalworking

349
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,880
the raw material that you get is not

350
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,360
always the nominal dimension

351
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,920
that it comes in so if you go to your

352
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,480
big box you know store that's selling

353
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
your lumber

354
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,920
you can walk up and it says two by four

355
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,240
but it's not actually two inches by four

356
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,320
inches it's one and a half inches by

357
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,000
three and a half inches and so when

358
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,360
you're designing your parts you need to

359
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,959
know that

360
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,600
as the part gets bigger the dimensions

361
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,680
actually change more so our two by ten

362
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,920
is i think a nine and a quarter inches

363
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,600
instead or it might actually be nine and

364
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,399
eight

365
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,480
somebody will correct me on that but the

366
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
key is is not nine and a half that

367
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,920
number is getting smaller and smaller as

368
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,440
the wood gets bigger

369
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,959
and

370
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,639
you just want to be aware of what the

371
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,120
actual dimension is so that you know how

372
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,560
much raw material you're working with

373
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,760
and then

374
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,360
now that you know how much raw material

375
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,880
you're working with you got to be sure

376
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,120
you have enough material to actually cut

377
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,399
out your parts

378
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,399
and that you have enough raw material to

379
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,560
actually work the piece

380
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,639
so this is more important with metal

381
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,800
working than woodworking but

382
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,240
if you are machining a piece for example

383
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
you got to have enough not only to cut

384
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,160
your part out but you also need to have

385
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,920
enough material left that you can hold

386
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,200
it in your vice or if it's in

387
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,959
if it's in the jaws

388
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,720
whatever it is you need to make sure

389
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,000
that you've got enough material to

390
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,079
actually hold on to the part while

391
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,160
you're machining it and then you can run

392
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,600
into similar problems with woodworking

393
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,120
but not quite as often as machining

394
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,639
again one of those things to be thinking

395
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,480
about during the design process you

396
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,760
don't want to think about this when

397
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,519
you're already cutting out your pieces

398
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,000
this one

399
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
is pretty important it's a surprising

400
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,199
problem

401
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,760
and that is when you're designing it you

402
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,600
have to make sure that you can actually

403
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,160
assemble it and here's what i mean like

404
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,079
if you're using cad software for example

405
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,560
you can put fasteners anywhere

406
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,079
it doesn't really matter if there's

407
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,160
actually room to put the fastener in and

408
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,279
take it out

409
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,680
or if there's room to put a tool on top

410
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,320
of the fastener and then tighten it down

411
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,920
so all of these are things that you want

412
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,600
to think about if you're putting nails

413
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,680
in your piece do you actually have room

414
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,000
to swing a hammer and hit the nail

415
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,839
these are things that are really easy to

416
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,680
overlook when you are a beginner and

417
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
just getting started at this so it's

418
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,720
something you want to think about as

419
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,440
you're designing it can i assemble this

420
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,160
all of the fasteners if i want to glue

421
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
this thing up if it's a woodworking

422
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,240
project can i actually put clamps on it

423
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,760
to hold it together while the glue is

424
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,440
drying

425
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,360
thinking about the assembly process

426
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,120
while you're designing it will save you

427
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,880
a lot of headaches along the way

428
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,160
and then don't forget the fasteners but

429
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,560
here i'm not just talking about

430
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,399
uh what i just mentioned earlier about

431
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,240
how the fasteners will fit but just

432
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
thinking about them the whole process of

433
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,760
the fastener whether you're going to

434
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,519
have a nut on the back or not do you

435
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,600
need threads in there how long the

436
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,120
fastener needs to be

437
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,519
and whether that full length fastener

438
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,600
will still get in and out of place if

439
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
you need to disassemble it so just

440
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,519
thinking through the fasteners as a

441
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,360
separate thing from the whole assembly

442
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,040
will also save you a lot of trouble

443
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,839
all right a few more here check whether

444
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,480
it moves freely so this goes back to my

445
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,839
prototyping

446
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,839
when i first built this

447
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,279
i noticed that

448
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,760
it would actually stick so

449
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,600
uh the first iteration of this i

450
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,440
couldn't quite get it to tilt again i

451
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
was new to designing stuff like this so

452
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,519
i actually loosened up the holes and i

453
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,120
found that that gave me just a little

454
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,639
bit more room

455
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,839
to allow it to flip over

456
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,720
in the final design i ended up adding

457
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,959
slots there which allowed it to slide

458
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,720
back and forth during the movement and

459
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,800
that gave me just enough play to make it

460
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,160
work fluently

461
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,600
so these are things you want to think

462
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,680
about whether you need slots or not

463
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,600
whether you whether your structure

464
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,519
actually has enough room to move

465
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,320
and then also well while we're talking

466
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,120
about prototypes you want to think about

467
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,360
how it's going to withstand the load so

468
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,959
i would take the time to kind of push on

469
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,720
the different sides of it

470
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,240
where the weight would be and just

471
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,160
thinking through what your loads will

472
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,639
actually be

473
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,560
and i think we've covered those two

474
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
all right

475
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,639
so moving on

476
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,320
shapes

477
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,800
now i'm showing you an i-beam because

478
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,279
this really represents like the ideal

479
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,120
material and shape right it's the

480
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,079
perfect marriage of having a good shape

481
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,320
as well as the right material still is

482
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,279
extremely strong and i-beams optimize

483
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,519
the shape of the material that's why you

484
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,279
see them used so much in order to

485
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,759
withstand bending

486
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,880
but

487
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,800
there's another element that i want you

488
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,839
to think about here so i'm gonna give

489
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,759
you a second to look at this

490
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,519
and

491
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,360
which one of these would withstand the

492
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,639
load better

493
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,079
would it be this i-beam or this i-beam

494
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,160
i'm expecting this to be a fairly easy

495
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,520
question it's the follow-up question

496
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,640
that makes this a little bit more

497
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,319
surprising

498
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,720
so hopefully you selected this one right

499
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
this is what an i-beam is designed for

500
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,119
it's got the maximum amount of material

501
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,880
lined up with the load

502
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,679
but

503
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,679
here's where people make mistakes

504
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,559
including engineers sometimes is yellow

505
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,039
is not always gravity you can have loads

506
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,640
on the side

507
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,599
so

508
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,960
let's use a ruler for example

509
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,679
if this ruler was my i-beam and i have

510
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,240
it in this orientation and then there's

511
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,960
a load on it

512
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,280
you can see even this piece of steel

513
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,640
starts to bow

514
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,720
way more than i wanted to and hopefully

515
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,080
you wouldn't want it to bow this much

516
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,880
either unless you were designing a uh a

517
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
diving board

518
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,360
but if you rotate it this way

519
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,440
there's no no bending at all right and

520
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,840
it's imperceptible the amount of bending

521
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,679
and that's because the load is in line

522
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,640
with the maximum amount of material

523
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,840
but here's the part i want you to think

524
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,240
about sometimes the load is not gravity

525
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,600
sometimes the load is in the other

526
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,360
direction so if i had a load going like

527
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,160
this i've got the same problem right

528
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,600
rotate it this way it's still bending so

529
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
this happens when you are designing

530
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,520
something that say it was overhung and

531
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,320
you had a motor here with a belt drive

532
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,080
then the belt actually creates a pulling

533
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,400
force in this direction and therefore

534
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,640
your beam will bend so under those

535
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,960
applications it might actually be better

536
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,880
if it was designed this way

537
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,559
to resist the load

538
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,679
so

539
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,039
the key message that i want you to take

540
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,720
away from this is think about the

541
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,880
orientation of the load and then that

542
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,280
will help you design a better structure

543
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,120
that way you don't make all your i-beams

544
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,640
like this when the load is actually in

545
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,039
this direction is what i'm getting at

546
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,960
probably a really good example that we

547
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,400
can all think of if you've ever

548
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,799
assembled a bookshelf then you know you

549
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,679
can put the framing together first

550
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,120
and if you put something on it it's

551
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,039
probably fine but if you lean on the

552
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,559
side it tips right over if you don't

553
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,799
have the back on it right because that

554
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,360
back plate is what gives you stiffness

555
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,480
in that uh lateral direction without

556
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,320
that back plate in place

557
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,720
then your whole bookcase will collapse

558
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,400
and it's the same with all of your

559
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
designs if you design it in such a way

560
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
that it can handle whatever loads you

561
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,160
put on it whether you're leaning on your

562
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,559
bookcase from the side or stacking heavy

563
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,880
books on the top it can stand up to the

564
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,240
load in both applications

565
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,280
[Music]

566
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,600
all right

567
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,039
all right so i'm not going to dwell on

568
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,039
this one too much but this one is just a

569
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,120
fun one i think both for

570
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,039
engineers as well as those who aren't

571
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,799
engineers so i want to kind of

572
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,120
differentiate between strength strength

573
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,520
and stiffness a lot of people think

574
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
because they normally come together we

575
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,640
kind of think of them as being the same

576
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,480
but they're not like

577
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,200
i'm using breadsticks here the uh

578
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,919
because they're i think they represent

579
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,080
stiffness in a way that makes a lot of

580
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,280
sense to us even if you don't eat

581
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,440
breadsticks you've broken one before and

582
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,679
you know they're extremely stiff but

583
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,440
also very brittle they have almost no

584
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,360
strength and rubber bands are kind of

585
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,960
the opposite they are

586
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,880
not stiff at all they stretch when even

587
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
the slightest load but they can be

588
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,760
really strong i mean the thicker the

589
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,640
rubber band obviously the stronger it is

590
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,000
so

591
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,919
we have materials where we can see

592
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,919
examples of high strength and low

593
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,880
stiffness and vice versa high stiffness

594
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,039
and low strength now what does that mean

595
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,760
to you well

596
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,280
different materials have different

597
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,360
combinations of strength and stiffness

598
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,039
and so you want to think about that

599
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,400
whenever you are designing your

600
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
structure if you're making like a fancy

601
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,559
coffee table let's say with the glass

602
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,799
top well that glass

603
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,039
it has kind of medium strength but it's

604
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,760
extremely stiff and brittle so if you

605
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,159
put that glass top on a wooden table

606
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,480
that's not designed to be stiff then any

607
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
flexing of the table can break your

608
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,880
glass so obviously we don't want that

609
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,720
right ideally you want your materials to

610
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,919
have similar

611
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,080
strength and stiffness

612
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,240
but you can design your system in such a

613
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,000
way that it can handle that remember

614
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,120
what i said earlier about if you orient

615
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,720
the material in the direction of the

616
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,039
load it'll be stiffer you could do the

617
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,200
same thing with your wooden coffee table

618
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,039
if you orient the legs in such a way

619
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,559
that they're stiff in the way that they

620
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,640
would bend under the glass then you can

621
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,799
keep that from causing any damage to

622
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,840
your uh to your glass

623
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,039
table and then there's one more that i

624
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,559
find really interesting and that's the

625
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,240
difference between steel

626
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,000
and high strength steel

627
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,080
this isn't this is a problem that

628
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,240
engineers or this is an issue that

629
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,400
engineers can mess up

630
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,600
high strength steel and regular steel

631
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,360
have exactly the same modulus of

632
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,520
elasticity now i just threw a big word

633
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
at you all that means is they have

634
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,840
exactly the same amount of flexibility

635
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,880
so

636
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,200
if you have a steel structure

637
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,960
like this

638
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,640
with a load on it

639
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,799
and it's bending more than you like

640
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,360
then you might think and some engineers

641
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,760
think oh well i'll just get some high

642
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,679
strength steel instead of using this

643
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,280
replace it with a high strength steel

644
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,760
beam and then i'm good and then you put

645
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,679
the high strength steel beam in there

646
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,240
and it bends exactly the same amount

647
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,200
it's going to slide off okay it's good

648
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,720
it will bend exactly the same amount

649
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,919
because they have the same amount of

650
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,039
stiffness

651
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,120
so even though it can that high strength

652
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,520
steel can handle a higher load it's not

653
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,080
any stiffer

654
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,240
aluminum and rubber are just some more

655
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,480
examples aluminum has kind of a

656
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,919
interesting mixture it's a little bit

657
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,960
less stiff and a little less strong than

658
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,799
steel and then we've already talked

659
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,360
about rubber

660
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,799
all right we'll get into the fun stuff

661
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,159
now so that was a little bit about

662
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,320
design but let's talk about creating

663
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,799
motion here

664
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,400
so there's several different ways that

665
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
you can get your projects to move uh

666
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,720
obviously there's automatic motion which

667
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,039
is mostly what i work with using

668
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,520
electric motors and pneumatics uh we

669
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,679
will

670
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,520
maybe come back to this later but this

671
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
is an example of a pneumatic tube

672
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,480
if i wanted to get something to move

673
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,240
then you would hook up your air lines

674
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,039
here

675
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,120
and with some electrical valves you

676
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,039
could

677
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,640
push your load back and forth

678
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,480
just by flipping a switch

679
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,400
so maybe we'll come back to this if we

680
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
have time

681
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,480
i'll leave that there for now

682
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,280
but for diy projects you know you might

683
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,440
be looking for manual controls so maybe

684
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,159
perhaps a hand crank or just levers

685
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,360
rollers

686
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,559
whatever

687
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,799
hydraulics can be kind of messy but you

688
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,880
can get a lot of power

689
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,039
so

690
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,559
that's another

691
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,559
avenue that's similar to matic to

692
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,679
pneumatics

693
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,720
but um

694
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,960
typically a little bit more expensive

695
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,320
and requires

696
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,640
more equipment

697
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,159
all right let's focus on electric motors

698
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,799
here for a moment

699
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,120
can we

700
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,760
turn that off

701
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,440
all right i'm gonna try not to use up

702
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,679
all my time here because this is

703
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,080
by far my favorite topic in the world

704
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,120
all right

705
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,039
two kinds of motors let's start with dc

706
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,200
stepper motors fall under the dc

707
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,600
category although you can buy ac stepper

708
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,840
motors

709
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,520
stepper motors are really good for

710
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,679
applications where you need very precise

711
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,559
control of the position

712
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,360
these motors don't usually have feedback

713
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,279
in other words they're kind of blind you

714
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,679
just send a post to them and they move

715
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,600
forward without sending any information

716
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,000
back so if you overload them

717
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,840
then you can lose your position without

718
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,520
knowing it that's one of the downsides

719
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,960
to stepper motors

720
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,480
um

721
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,799
but what makes them really good is again

722
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,600
their position to their capacity to very

723
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,919
precisely control the position of your

724
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,600
load so if you have something that you

725
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,320
want to move to two spots back and forth

726
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,960
then you could write a little program

727
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,480
set up your stepper motor and they can

728
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,159
hit those two positions over and over

729
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,080
again as long as you're not overloading

730
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,570
the motor

731
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,840
[Music]

732
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,440
some of the downsides to stepper motors

733
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,600
though is they don't handle they don't

734
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,679
go very fast so their speeds are

735
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,240
typically very low like a thousand rpm

736
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,279
or less

737
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,320
and

738
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,840
again they don't have any encoder

739
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,159
feedback unless you get a special type

740
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,320
so if you overload them you can lose

741
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,559
your position

742
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,799
permanent magnet dc motors are probably

743
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,679
the most widely used motors for small

744
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,919
applications for remote control

745
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,400
applications i'm talking about if you've

746
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,640
ever taken apart an rc car then you've

747
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,080
seen one of these little permanent

748
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,960
magnet dc motors but they go all the way

749
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,200
up to one to two horsepower in some

750
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,600
cases you can get them to about three

751
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,840
horsepower but after that the permanent

752
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,679
magnets you store start

753
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,440
you don't have the same economy of scale

754
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,279
you start to lose the efficiency and

755
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,720
they usually switch to a different motor

756
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,080
type after that

757
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,760
but that gives you a sense of the range

758
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,840
if you're looking for very small motors

759
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,360
you want something that's

760
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,520
portable you can run it with batteries

761
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,880
that's the kind of motor you're looking

762
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,600
for

763
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,760
they're usually very responsive to speed

764
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,080
control so they're a good option for

765
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,760
projects that where you need to be able

766
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,679
to control the speed and you don't need

767
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,240
fancy controls for that usually

768
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,760
so that's what makes them a good choice

769
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,240
brushless dc motors are

770
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,559
a relatively new invention in the sense

771
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,960
that um they've kind of exploded on the

772
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,159
market it's not that they haven't been

773
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,159
around but now we see this huge

774
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,039
explosion in the last several years of

775
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,400
not only these high-end rc cars but

776
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,799
the explosion of drones those kinds of

777
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,720
applications tend to have these types of

778
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,679
motors

779
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,360
so they require a little bit more

780
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,600
sophisticated controller but again

781
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,520
because of the economy of scale there's

782
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,799
so many of these things out on the

783
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,120
market you can still get controllers for

784
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,279
pretty cheap

785
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,520
servo motors come in two flavors there's

786
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,480
this little tiny guy that

787
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,840
depending upon what you're used to

788
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,360
working with this might be what you

789
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,679
think of when you think of a servo motor

790
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,640
but then

791
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,720
there's the bigger one like this one

792
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,240
that you see down here in the corner

793
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,320
that is a one horsepower or 750 watt ac

794
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,559
servo motor and it's got a little gear

795
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,399
box on it as well

796
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,320
so this is usually what i'm thinking

797
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,159
about when i say servo motor so if you

798
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,760
hear me say servo motor later in the

799
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,720
video

800
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,120
or in this conference this is probably

801
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
what i'm talking about but there's also

802
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,799
this little guy as well

803
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,320
both of them are similar in that they

804
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
give you very precise control over the

805
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,399
position of whatever's connected to it

806
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,919
but obviously there's a huge difference

807
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,840
in power output these

808
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,760
usually don't scale up to very large

809
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,480
sizes or high speeds whereas these you

810
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,039
can get both you can go both very large

811
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,720
as well as very high in speed

812
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,520
all right breaking down the ac motors so

813
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,600
if you're using an ac motor your project

814
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,120
is probably getting a little larger at

815
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,919
this point we're talking about possibly

816
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,080
making your own power tools at least

817
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,360
that's the kind of project i'm usually

818
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,840
thinking about when i think of ac motors

819
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,440
and this first one the single phase

820
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,600
induction motor is by far the most

821
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,520
widely available one

822
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,360
what makes this guy good is you can

823
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,039
usually just plug it into the wall and

824
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,679
you got 1750 rpm

825
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,480
or sometimes 3 600 rpm depending upon

826
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,720
which one you get

827
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,679
and so

828
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,000
this is a good choice if you

829
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,120
need very good speed control good power

830
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,279
and that guy will give you good torque

831
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,360
as well

832
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,080
the universal motor oh wait so single

833
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
phase motors if you are

834
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
uh you know scrapping motors and stuff

835
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,000
which is something i often do like if i

836
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,760
see a treadmill on the side of the road

837
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,520
i might drag that thing home and take

838
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,360
the motor out of it so the treadmill

839
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,559
will most likely have a pmdc permanent

840
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,159
magnet dc motor but sometimes they have

841
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,880
these three phase ac motors in them it

842
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,640
just depends on how new the treadmill is

843
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,279
this is kind of a recent trend

844
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,600
the single phase induction motor you

845
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,840
will usually find these in washing

846
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,559
machines dryers at least here in the u.s

847
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,919
in other countries you might see a

848
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,200
universal motor in a washing machine

849
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,399
but

850
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,080
so single-phase induction motor it's

851
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,240
very common on power tools so if you

852
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,080
have a drill press or

853
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,240
table saw anything like that it's

854
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,080
probably got a single phase induction

855
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,440
motor on it

856
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,120
even your air compressor would have that

857
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,039
on it

858
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,360
three-phase ac is also an induction

859
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
motor but these are usually found in

860
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,840
industrial applications so these motors

861
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,240
can be very large we're talking about

862
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,159
thousands of horsepower

863
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,960
it would be a three-phase ac motor so

864
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,600
very good speed very good torque but if

865
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
you're in an american household then

866
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,960
you're going to need a special

867
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,799
controller that's going to take the

868
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,120
power from the wall and convert it to

869
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,720
three-phase ac which is what you would

870
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,880
need

871
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,559
servo motors come in a lot of different

872
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,559
flavors some of them are

873
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,039
dc powered actually which could be used

874
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,720
which could fall into this category but

875
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,159
still be this type

876
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,200
but most of them are ac synchronous

877
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,960
servo motors chasmal foam

878
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,440
and these motors are what you find on my

879
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,159
robot arm so all of the joints all seven

880
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,520
or six joints uh in the freestanding arm

881
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,360
are several motors like the one that you

882
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,000
see over here

883
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,320
and oh man we're doing good on time too

884
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,399
we are almost there people

885
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,039
all right so sizing a motor

886
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,880
what do you need to do now i'm spending

887
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,240
a lot of time on this because i feel

888
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,399
like if your projects are going to move

889
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,080
you probably have a motor inside of it

890
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,760
so i thought this was this is worth

891
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,520
investing some time in

892
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,080
all right how much torque do you need

893
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,880
uh i have talked about this in a whole

894
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,120
bunch of different videos and so i

895
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,200
decided rather than try to add a little

896
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,760
bit here and possibly fumble it i've got

897
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,640
a nice edited version of this discussion

898
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,120
from a youtube video and this is about

899
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,720
a minute and a half maybe so i'm just

900
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,320
going to play that for you rather than

901
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,640
try to explain it live since it'll

902
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,279
likely be better let's try that many of

903
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,960
us have experienced the sensation of

904
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
sitting on a seesaw with someone whose

905
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,360
weight doesn't equal ours hitting kids

906
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,200
without thinking about it intuitively

907
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,600
adjust their position on the seesaw to

908
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
try to balance out their weights what

909
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,360
you're actually doing is balancing out

910
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,519
the torque torque is a combination of

911
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,279
the force you're applying in this case

912
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,279
your body weight multiplied by the

913
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,519
length of your lever or the distance to

914
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,440
the center of rotation these two

915
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,360
variables are equally important in this

916
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,200
example you can see we've got twice the

917
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,399
weight on one side

918
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,559
being balanced out by a lever that's

919
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,720
twice as long now i want you to think of

920
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,960
this pulley as a lever with the length

921
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,880
of the lever being the radius of the

922
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,720
circle here motor has a fixed amount of

923
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,320
torque that it can put out and just like

924
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
we saw in the example with the seesaw if

925
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,840
you increase the length of the lever on

926
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,519
one side you're going to need to

927
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,440
decrease the force in order for them to

928
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,840
be equal so using different size pulleys

929
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,519
will give you different amounts of force

930
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,880
output but there's an interesting

931
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,320
trade-off because the arc length here is

932
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,159
much greater on this one

933
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,720
i've given up some force but i've

934
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,799
increased in speed in fact they're

935
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,120
directly proportional putting this one

936
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,000
on the motor will give me a lower speed

937
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,399
but more force output putting this one

938
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,720
on the motor will give me a much higher

939
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,360
speed but a lot less force now that we

940
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,120
have that foundation let's take a closer

941
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,440
look at the power formula here in the us

942
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,519
the horsepower is the customary unit but

943
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,440
i'll be happy to show you what's on the

944
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,880
screen here as well

945
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,240
since pretty much everyone else in the

946
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,640
world uses that we're simply multiplying

947
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,200
torque times speed and dividing it by a

948
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,519
constant you can also back calculate

949
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,440
whatever variables you need let's take

950
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,200
this motor for example we have both the

951
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,360
horsepower and the speed but we want to

952
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,880
figure out how much torque this motor

953
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,559
has we can rearrange this formula a

954
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,640
little bit and you can calculate how

955
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,559
much torque the motor is producing at

956
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,200
best feed

957
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,919
all right so let's elaborate that on a

958
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:10,640
little

959
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,279
elaborate a little bit on that topic uh

960
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,320
here you see an example of me trying to

961
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,880
figure out how much power i need to

962
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,440
rotate the handle on my table saw

963
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,120
this is a project that i did and there's

964
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,360
a youtube video about this where i fully

965
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,200
automated my table saw i made a touch

966
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,240
screen i wrote a program so that i could

967
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,640
type in okay i want the fence to go to

968
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,559
40 inches i want the blade height to be

969
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,679
two inches

970
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,760
and so on or i want the blade angle to

971
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,000
be 45 degrees

972
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,159
you punch in those numbers you hit enter

973
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,919
and then all of the

974
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,679
various items will move to their right

975
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:46,640
position

976
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,919
and that's what i'm doing here so

977
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,679
essentially what i did is i bought a

978
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,799
fish scale and that's what you're

979
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,600
looking at hooked it onto the handle and

980
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,919
then started pulling on the handle well

981
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,840
the fifth scale is going to read out the

982
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,240
force required to move the handle so

983
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,760
that's the first part of my torque

984
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,080
formula and then the second part is the

985
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,039
length from the center of this circle

986
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,199
out to where the hook is so if i

987
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,159
multiply this length by the force that's

988
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,520
written on the screen

989
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,679
now i have my torque and i know how much

990
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,679
torque it takes from the motor to rotate

991
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,359
the handle

992
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,119
as all of the math i'm going to give you

993
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,800
in this entire video

994
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,879
measure the torque actually and you got

995
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,800
to put that in another formula

996
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,719
so the next thing you need to know is

997
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,879
how fast you want the thing to move

998
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,040
so again for my table saw i decided i

999
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,760
wanted the handle to spin about twice as

1000
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,159
fast as if i was spinning it by hand i

1001
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,040
picked that completely arbitrarily

1002
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,960
just basically deciding that i wanted it

1003
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,280
to be faster to me maybe by about two

1004
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,040
times and that was all the decision that

1005
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,440
went into that but of course it depends

1006
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,199
a lot on what you're making right as to

1007
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,359
how fast you want this thing to go

1008
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,280
but what's interesting about that is

1009
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,760
once you plug these into your formula

1010
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,920
and uh in using horsepower you're going

1011
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,640
to divide by 5252

1012
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,720
and you'll get the units in horsepower

1013
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,160
well now you know exactly how big a

1014
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
motor to buy

1015
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,760
as long as your motor has the right

1016
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,560
amount of power then you can use gears

1017
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,119
to get the right speed and torque ratio

1018
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,880
so we'll come back to that idea here in

1019
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,000
just a minute

1020
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,800
but

1021
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,720
now this is all of the math that you're

1022
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,400
going to need in order to figure out how

1023
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,160
big your motor is going to be you can

1024
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,400
calculate torque by using a simple fist

1025
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,040
scale and a ruler and then you can

1026
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,880
figure out the speed based on whatever

1027
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,119
performance parameters you need and once

1028
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,359
you multiply those two together you'll

1029
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,000
figure out how much power you need

1030
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,280
and then of course i've got the little

1031
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,400
conversion from horsepower to watts

1032
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,440
for

1033
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,119
since everybody else in the world uses

1034
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,359
watts and we like our customary units

1035
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,880
here in the u.s

1036
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,320
i feel pretty comfortable working in

1037
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,920
both so

1038
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,480
you'll hear me kind of intermixing the

1039
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,040
uh millimeters and inches of horsepower

1040
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,599
and so on

1041
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,480
all right so i mentioned gears well

1042
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,320
i think the best way to think about

1043
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,400
gears is to just think of them as

1044
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,280
spinning levers so this image here is a

1045
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,760
clock that i built several years ago now

1046
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,599
and i used a whole bunch of different

1047
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,560
combinations of gears but because mostly

1048
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,839
i just wanted it to be visually

1049
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,280
interesting but i'm bringing this up

1050
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,320
because

1051
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,240
i had the full amount of power i needed

1052
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,720
to move all of these gears but to keep

1053
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,760
time

1054
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,119
i had to make sure the gears were all

1055
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,040
moving at the right speeds for their

1056
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
position i've got a certain set of gears

1057
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,359
driving the hour hand and then following

1058
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,680
that i've got another set that's driving

1059
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,079
the minute hand and their ratios need to

1060
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,599
be correct in order for the clock to

1061
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,480
read time and that's all based on the

1062
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,040
ratios between their sizes

1063
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,400
even though i'm using the same amount of

1064
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,200
power input for the whole system

1065
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,880
so i want to go back to that

1066
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,440
illustration i gave you earlier which is

1067
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,200
this lever

1068
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,640
now if you

1069
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,200
consider this to be think of this as a

1070
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,400
gearbox

1071
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,320
and on the left side we've got our gear

1072
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
input and on the right side we've got

1073
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,800
our gear output essentially what you're

1074
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,280
looking at here is the side on the left

1075
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,520
has to move a greater distance but with

1076
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,000
less force and on the output side we can

1077
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,320
move a greater load but it's going to

1078
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,560
move a shorter distance a shorter arc

1079
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,839
distance

1080
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,880
that's the trade-off

1081
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,240
gears are only useful when you have

1082
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,040
enough power but the wrong speed

1083
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,880
i really want to be careful i want to

1084
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,520
make sure i point out that gears do not

1085
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
add power this is a

1086
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,280
very common misconception that people

1087
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,520
have and i get this email all the time

1088
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,640
like i'll have a system and i say well

1089
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,640
you know i need it to go faster and then

1090
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,079
people will say oh well can't you just

1091
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,880
use gears to make it go faster like yes

1092
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,359
but only if you have more power to make

1093
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,359
up for the additional speed

1094
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,079
so

1095
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,400
this is why you don't see drag racers

1096
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,520
with

1097
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,680
drill size motors on the back and just a

1098
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,000
huge gearbox is because

1099
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,839
it doesn't scale up that way

1100
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,920
you have to add

1101
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,839
you have to add more power to increase

1102
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,320
the speed or increase the torque

1103
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,240
while keeping the other the same

1104
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,040
but

1105
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,640
if the total power output stays the same

1106
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,320
then you can increase the speed by

1107
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,599
giving up torque or you can increase the

1108
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,160
torque by giving up speed and that's the

1109
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,960
trade-off that gears give you

1110
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,720
but doing either of those will not give

1111
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,920
you any more total power

1112
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,960
got it

1113
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,200
good

1114
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,400
all right

1115
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
and uh oh i got eight minutes left on

1116
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,280
the clock but so i do want to share one

1117
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,680
more thing about the pneumatics

1118
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,880
and that is

1119
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,520
[Music]

1120
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,880
these guys

1121
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,599
have a lot of pros and cons all right so

1122
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,160
number one when it comes to

1123
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,000
pneumatics i'm going to

1124
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,599
i stopped your slideshare to put you

1125
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,200
full screen so you you can start it

1126
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
again if you'd like sorry about that no

1127
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,800
that's good i was actually when i saw

1128
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,040
the pop-up on this side i um i had the

1129
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,480
same idea but you were just doing it

1130
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,839
ahead of me so that's good thank you for

1131
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,280
that all right so uh back to pneumatics

1132
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,640
here

1133
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,880
with pneumatics you can get

1134
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,960
very fast motion so if you need to move

1135
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,040
something in a straight line pneumatics

1136
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,119
will give you very high speed

1137
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,440
not as good position control although

1138
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,359
there are a lot of options here and

1139
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,359
more expensive options here in the

1140
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,359
recent past that have come out

1141
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,200
but in general

1142
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,320
you're not looking for a lot of

1143
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,760
precision but you're just looking for

1144
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,520
one extreme or the other

1145
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,440
then pneumatics will get you there very

1146
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,760
high speed linear motion

1147
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
and the only thing that you but you do

1148
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
need other auxiliary equipment for

1149
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,320
example you've got your air lines you're

1150
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,480
going to need a power

1151
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,720
you're going to need your air compressor

1152
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,640
filters to get the moisture out things

1153
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,560
like that

1154
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,280
so

1155
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,880
it's just something to consider that

1156
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,960
gears and motors aren't the only way to

1157
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
create motion you could also use

1158
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,440
pneumatics hydraulics would be very much

1159
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,680
the same except you're pumping fluid

1160
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,359
instead of pumping air

1161
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,119
or a liquid fluid instead of air

1162
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,280
and then i also grabbed a few gearboxes

1163
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,880
just to show you that they come in a lot

1164
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,119
of different form factors this is called

1165
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,200
a harmonic drive this is kind of a high

1166
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,880
dollar gearbox actually i should have

1167
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,800
grabbed a cheaper one

1168
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,000
but

1169
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,359
these guys give you a huge amount of

1170
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,599
speed reduction in a very small package

1171
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,880
this is a 101 gearbox and look how small

1172
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,079
that is it's incredible

1173
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,160
this one is 50 to one but this is a

1174
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,920
planetary gear

1175
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,000
and these are rated for about the same

1176
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,520
amount of power so that gives you a

1177
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,520
sense of how much difference there is in

1178
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,560
size

1179
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,440
but

1180
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,280
anyway you don't even really know you

1181
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,319
don't need to know the difference

1182
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,800
between a harmonic drive and a planetary

1183
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,599
gear what you need to know is that a

1184
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,400
harmonic drive will cost more but they

1185
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,079
are much smaller and they're more

1186
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,280
precise they don't have any backlash

1187
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,920
and then planetary gears these guys will

1188
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,079
be a little bit cheaper but you know

1189
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,760
they're larger i don't want to say

1190
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,440
sloppy but they have just a tiny bit

1191
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,040
more play in them

1192
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,920
so

1193
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,359
i think i am ready to take some

1194
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,610
questions

1195
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,319
[Music]

1196
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,319
that was an incredible talk thank you so

1197
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,800
much and we do have uh some questions

1198
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,200
from discord if you're watching and you

1199
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,119
want to ask questions drop into the

1200
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,599
discord remoticon questions channel and

1201
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,440
i'll try to harvest those

1202
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,880
jeremy one of the really interesting

1203
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
ones that came up was

1204
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,480
someone said i always struggle with

1205
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,480
understanding static force to get a

1206
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,960
motor moving versus how much force a

1207
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,680
motor can provide once it's at speed

1208
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,079
what do you think about that

1209
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,160
okay so uh

1210
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,000
certainly there is a difference there

1211
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
but for the most part

1212
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,200
it's not

1213
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,520
a significant factor and the reason i

1214
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,359
say that is because

1215
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,079
most motor types pretty much all of them

1216
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,640
well that's not entirely true

1217
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,000
if you're using the right motor type and

1218
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,760
i have a couple of videos on this that i

1219
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,359
refer you to

1220
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,160
there's one where i discuss

1221
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,839
i can't remember the title right off the

1222
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,079
top of my head but in the thumbnail you

1223
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,839
see two motors there like a big one and

1224
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,119
a small one and um i'm just basically

1225
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,040
comparing the pros and cons of each

1226
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,440
motor type but if you watch that video

1227
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,880
you'll see the ones that fit what i'm

1228
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,359
about to say but for the most part

1229
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,040
motors have

1230
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,599
all of their torque when they start so

1231
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,720
that means that if the motor is still

1232
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,720
and then you hit it with power

1233
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,640
every everything that that motor has and

1234
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,720
then even above its rated power is

1235
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,960
available to push the load forward

1236
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,760
so

1237
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,440
as long as the running load is not too

1238
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
high for the rated power then you're

1239
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,680
usually okay because the starting torque

1240
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,440
of the motor is usually enough to kind

1241
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,200
of get the thing pushed off

1242
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,000
but

1243
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,240
um if you want to be safe i mean like

1244
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,720
when i'm designing a system i make sure

1245
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,880
that the motor is that the rating of the

1246
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
motor is actually higher than whatever

1247
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,960
the starting torque requirement is

1248
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,440
and um that way you're way over in the

1249
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,440
safety margin but you don't necessarily

1250
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,280
have to do that when i'm doing my home

1251
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,200
projects for example i don't go through

1252
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,560
the trouble of that because that raises

1253
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,400
the cost a lot you need a much larger

1254
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,800
much more powerful motor for

1255
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
a higher load that only lasts for a

1256
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,640
fraction of a second it's just that

1257
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,280
first one second where you've got that

1258
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,880
big spike that you need a lot of power

1259
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,800
to get the load moving but then after

1260
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,560
that the motor is just you know costing

1261
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,319
in uh and it's easy to handle so

1262
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,079
that that question can get really deep

1263
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,040
so i think i'm just going to leave it

1264
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,280
right there but hopefully i can point

1265
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,119
you to that video that'll

1266
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,560
uh tell you what kind of motor you

1267
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,839
should be using for those kinds of

1268
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,160
things

1269
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,200
so you talked about dimensioning your

1270
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,400
materials he also talked about

1271
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,359
elasticity and stiffness but i'm

1272
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,920
wondering um how do you discover new

1273
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,599
materials it seems like material science

1274
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,079
is this whole other thing and what do

1275
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,440
you do when you're working on something

1276
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,280
and you find you've hit a limitation of

1277
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,640
the material you plan to use

1278
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,240
well uh generally what i do is

1279
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,520
i literally just uh there's a website

1280
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,319
called make it from

1281
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,720
and uh well i don't need to pull it up

1282
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,400
but there's a website called make it

1283
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,599
from and there you'll see a huge list of

1284
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,440
materials you can do

1285
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,240
put them side by side and see how

1286
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,920
elastic they are how strong they are

1287
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,839
what their breaking strength is and

1288
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,119
things like that

1289
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,280
and so that would usually be the place

1290
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,480
that i go

1291
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,520
but

1292
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,920
i would caution you though instead of

1293
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,200
making

1294
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,800
how do i want to pull this

1295
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,960
i would be more concerned about the

1296
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,839
shape

1297
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,599
than the strength of the material

1298
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,440
remember earlier in the slide i said

1299
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,440
that strength and

1300
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,040
that shape is just as important as

1301
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,680
strength very often your project fails

1302
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,720
because

1303
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,960
you've designed it like this when it

1304
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,720
should be like this

1305
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,280
so if you can always keep that in mind

1306
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,560
very often

1307
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,319
i mean you can certainly reach the limit

1308
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,839
of the material there are applications

1309
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,560
where you need something stronger but i

1310
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,480
would look at this problem first have

1311
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,839
you designed it

1312
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,839
shape wise to be strong enough for the

1313
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,079
load and put the maximum amount of

1314
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,839
material in line with the direction of

1315
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,640
the load before you change the material

1316
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,599
because

1317
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,760
you can end up spending way more money

1318
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,560
on buying like this high dollar titanium

1319
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,720
when just a small change in the shape

1320
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,960
would have revolutionized your product

1321
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,280
and for me obviously that's a huge deal

1322
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,119
right because i'm designing these

1323
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,599
products for companies and they don't

1324
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,599
want their product to cost 10 times as

1325
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,440
much if i could have changed it just a

1326
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,280
little bit and allowed them to use a

1327
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,359
cheaper material so steel is just

1328
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,200
readily available is

1329
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,720
in many cases it's even cheaper than

1330
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,319
aluminum

1331
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,160
so if i can make it out of steel that's

1332
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,079
usually a better alternative and i try

1333
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,440
to make the shape

1334
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,680
uh i try to optimize the shape before i

1335
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,480
change the material

1336
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,720
uh so someone mentioned that high

1337
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,520
strength steel has the same modulus

1338
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,720
elasticity uh what kind of strength does

1339
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,359
it win at

1340
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,839
well it depends on which one you can get

1341
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,680
different grades of steel

1342
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,960
and

1343
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,400
and so you're going to have a different

1344
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,319
strength at each one in some cases you

1345
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:33,599
can get

1346
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,359
grades of steel that are two and three

1347
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,000
times stronger than the standard steel

1348
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,839
that you might buy at just your local

1349
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:40,960
dealer

1350
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,119
but in terms of the modulus of

1351
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,720
elasticity that's what i was talking

1352
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,720
about earlier in the sense that

1353
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,800
uh it's just as flexible

1354
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,319
so if the point is to make sure that

1355
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,240
this thing doesn't break

1356
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,480
oh sorry about that

1357
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,920
so if you're just concerned about it

1358
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,960
breaking

1359
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,760
then you uh it's still making noise

1360
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,200
there we go

1361
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,240
if you're just concerned about it

1362
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,079
breaking then you might switch to a

1363
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,079
higher grade of steel but if your

1364
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,400
structure is too flexible

1365
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,119
then it's not the steel it's the uh it's

1366
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,560
not the strength of the steel it's the

1367
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,839
shape

1368
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,680
so

1369
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,800
i think i answered that question

1370
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,640
hopefully i did

1371
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,800
i'm gonna say yes

1372
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,599
uh another question that came in says uh

1373
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,160
i've always seen pneumatics portrayed as

1374
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,520
dangerous because it of the if the load

1375
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,680
changes the actuator can extend

1376
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,319
instantly how do you design around that

1377
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,160
okay um

1378
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,640
i guess there's a lot of factors there

1379
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,599
so

1380
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,680
it kind of depends on

1381
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,559
why your load would change

1382
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:49,520
and

1383
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,680
what other sort of systems you have in

1384
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,960
play

1385
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,480
i don't usually think i don't think of

1386
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,079
pneumatics as really being dangerous

1387
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,119
except the fact that

1388
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,200
because it's a high pressure system i

1389
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,520
mean it does move very fast when it

1390
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,680
moves so

1391
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,400
you can mitigate that with a lot of

1392
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,920
different things there are dampeners

1393
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,760
that you can install in your system

1394
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,400
which will allow the air to come in or

1395
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,319
exit out very slowly

1396
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,160
so when i was working with destin at

1397
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,319
smarter every day on the baseball cannon

1398
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,800
uh we put a dampener behind the

1399
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,760
receiving end of the cannon so this is a

1400
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,200
i don't

1401
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,119
know if you guys have seen it or not but

1402
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,280
this baseball cannon fires baseball at

1403
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,119
supersonic speeds we're talking about

1404
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,880
thousands of miles per hour

1405
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,880
launching a baseball out of the end and

1406
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,440
so there's a piston that flies back

1407
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,520
when the cannon is released because of

1408
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,520
all the enormous pressure we have to

1409
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,599
sling that baseball out of there and we

1410
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,400
have to catch it so to speak so we're

1411
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,079
using a pneumatic cylinder but that

1412
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,319
pneumatic cylinder when it hits

1413
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,599
uh there's a

1414
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,240
a valve on the back that just sort of

1415
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,800
lets the air slowly leak out and that's

1416
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,040
we're using it like a dampener

1417
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,240
in this case you would do that in

1418
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,240
reverse you can make it so that the air

1419
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,680
coming in is is dampened and if your

1420
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,280
load suddenly shifts

1421
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,040
then it can only move at a very slow

1422
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,000
speed

1423
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,599
uh there are way more options than that

1424
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,800
but that's just the first one that comes

1425
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,960
to mind you can there's all kinds of

1426
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,400
little gadgets you can hook onto your

1427
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,400
pneumatics to control the position

1428
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,160
control the speed and do all kinds of

1429
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,720
stuff with it

1430
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,200
there's an interesting question in here

1431
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,960
about three-phase motors the person

1432
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,760
that's asking it uh thinks that you use

1433
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,359
three-phase in your robot arm but

1434
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,599
whether you did or not uh they're asking

1435
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,079
if there's a way to how difficult exp or

1436
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,800
expensive is it to um

1437
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,280
get a converter or like bake a converter

1438
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,640
into the the

1439
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,319
design so that you don't need

1440
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,359
three-phase power always to uh

1441
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:50,640
power the machine

1442
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,440
okay

1443
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,839
this is a fantastic question i love this

1444
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,960
uh i am always building with industrial

1445
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,000
stuff so three-phase is like a constant

1446
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,200
challenge for me

1447
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,079
and there are two solutions that i have

1448
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,440
used most often the first one is you can

1449
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,319
buy speed controllers that take single

1450
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,119
phase in and put three phase out so you

1451
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,680
are right all of the motors on my robot

1452
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,319
arm are three phase servo motors three

1453
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,079
phase ac servo

1454
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:20,960
so

1455
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,800
they require three phase power but

1456
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,800
they're not plugged into three phase in

1457
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,319
my shop it's just plugged into 240 volts

1458
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,440
single phase

1459
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,000
and then that comes into

1460
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,839
one single block that goes out to all of

1461
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,079
my servo controllers and the controllers

1462
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,280
themselves

1463
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,280
actually break out that single phase

1464
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,520
into three phase it's

1465
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,720
well there's a lot of things happening

1466
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,720
but basically it's turning it into dc

1467
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,079
and then breaking it up and making it

1468
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,920
kind of look like three-phase ac and

1469
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,119
that's what it's setting out to the

1470
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,040
motors so you know motors are dumb in

1471
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,480
that sense and they just they just kind

1472
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,839
of move because they think they're

1473
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,920
getting the right signal and and they do

1474
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,280
what they're supposed to do

1475
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,240
but

1476
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,800
so that's one method the other method

1477
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,880
would be to get something like a rotary

1478
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,440
phase converter which is another option

1479
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,079
that i have in my shop but that requires

1480
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,920
like a capacity bank capacitor bank and

1481
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,160
a three-phase motor so that three-phase

1482
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,319
motor will be hooked up to single-phase

1483
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,160
you have to kick it off somehow which is

1484
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,720
something i explained in a video i have

1485
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,720
and the video i think is actually titled

1486
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,200
how to get three phase from single phase

1487
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,200
and uh so yeah i think i'll leave it at

1488
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,119
that in that video i explained exactly

1489
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,119
how to do it but

1490
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,040
the short version of that story is

1491
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,119
you're gonna need a three-phase motor a

1492
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,240
bunch of capacitors and

1493
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,319
a way to start the motor and i explained

1494
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,279
all that in that video

1495
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,559
so it looks like we have two

1496
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,920
questions left

1497
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,400
one of them is on motors and another on

1498
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,280
cad so on the the motors one

1499
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,839
when you're connecting a motor do you

1500
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,520
have approaches that you like to use in

1501
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,440
your designs for the system to either

1502
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,280
slip or fail in non-destructive ways

1503
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,280
oh man i love that question i got more

1504
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,359
engineers on this call than i expected i

1505
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,800
think

1506
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,319
or it sounds like a question an engineer

1507
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,480
would ask but okay so my favorite by far

1508
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,559
my favorite method for transmitting

1509
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,280
power is with belts and it's for this

1510
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,839
very reason number one or this is one of

1511
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,240
the reasons is because

1512
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,280
if you have a significant overload that

1513
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,920
can be taken up by the belt breaking and

1514
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,240
then your system is released so it can

1515
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,559
fail safe in that sense you know i'm

1516
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,480
much less concerned about a belt you

1517
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,480
know breaking loose and whipping around

1518
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,640
usually i have belt guards and stuff too

1519
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,440
but um that's much less dangerous than

1520
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,680
you know my motor driving a system hard

1521
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,599
or destroying an expensive gearbox or

1522
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,440
things like that a belt's very cheap to

1523
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,640
replace

1524
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,599
so it doesn't destroy your whole system

1525
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,160
and then so that's number one number two

1526
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,559
uh belts are really cheap and so are

1527
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,040
pulleys and if you just think about it

1528
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,480
it makes sense from a manufacturing

1529
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,040
standpoint making a pulley it can just

1530
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,760
be

1531
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,400
cast and duplicated over and over again

1532
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,480
where gears are usually machined and

1533
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,720
they're just much more expensive to make

1534
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,599
so

1535
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,400
they're cheaper they're easier to align

1536
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,559
when you are setting your system up with

1537
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,280
a gearbox it's got to be almost perfect

1538
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,280
but with belts i mean you're supposed to

1539
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,599
align your belts but even if it's one

1540
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,920
degree off what you end up with is just

1541
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,760
wearing out the belt faster your system

1542
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,839
will still run and again because the

1543
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,160
belts are cheap it's not a problem

1544
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,040
so

1545
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,280
belt drive will be my go-to for systems

1546
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,160
where i want the motor to decouple

1547
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,000
in case of some kind of catastrophic

1548
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,160
failure and uh and again there are other

1549
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,319
options but that's by far my favorite

1550
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,559
and if you go back to my catalog of

1551
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,640
videos you will see that's the most

1552
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,960
common method that i use throughout my

1553
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,079
projects for those reasons

1554
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,280
all right and the last one you made a

1555
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,800
really interesting point when you were

1556
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,480
talking about design at the beginning

1557
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,000
and i really appreciate it the the

1558
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,960
thought of um like the the fastener

1559
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,200
conundrum yeah you've designed something

1560
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,119
and you can't then fit the fastener in

1561
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,240
there so

1562
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,760
that kind of makes me think about like

1563
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,960
design rule checks for uh electronic cad

1564
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,280
like is there some kind of design rule

1565
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,680
check where you can assign lengths to

1566
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,599
the fasteners and have your cad program

1567
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:26,960
warn you that you're going to be in

1568
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,880
trouble

1569
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,559
not that i'm aware of

1570
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,160
that's a fantastic question but um

1571
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,920
you know i use solidworks for 3d

1572
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,680
modeling and there are

1573
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,760
a whole bunch of tools for checking for

1574
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,440
things like where the parts are

1575
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,599
interfering whether you have proper

1576
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,240
clearances you can have a check for

1577
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,079
tolerances and fits

1578
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,520
but

1579
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,319
i'm not aware of an option to check for

1580
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,559
clearance in the sense of

1581
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,640
an object being removed or placed

1582
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,440
manually so there are even options for

1583
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,680
if parts are moving will they hit each

1584
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,599
other like collision detection while in

1585
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,920
motion you can do that as well but i'm

1586
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,640
not aware of anything that would

1587
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,559
allow you to check for something like

1588
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:11,359
that

1589
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,920
uh to me you know it's a combination of

1590
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,240
experience and prototyping you know if

1591
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,280
you can

1592
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,720
well sometimes it's simple enough where

1593
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,799
you can just see it's obvious i won't be

1594
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,319
able to get my hand in there and get

1595
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,319
that fastener out or i can move the

1596
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:25,920
fastener back and then it's stuck i

1597
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,680
can't get it out or vice versa i can't

1598
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,558
get it in after it's fully assembled so

1599
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,400
but while i'm talking about that i do

1600
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,200
want to mention that it's easy to

1601
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,119
trap in both directions and what i mean

1602
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,319
by that is

1603
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:41,920
you can have it where the fastener can

1604
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,000
go in at one part of the assembly but

1605
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,079
then when it's complete you can't get it

1606
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,000
back out so you do want to think about

1607
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,799
it in all of its in all of the different

1608
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:53,280
states like when i mentioned how you

1609
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,359
want to make sure that your prototype

1610
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,680
can actually move and rest in all of the

1611
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,040
different positions and that it won't

1612
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,640
tip over a fall

1613
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,119
that like moving this like this changes

1614
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,880
the center of gravity

1615
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,799
so that's another thing to think about

1616
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,480
when you are

1617
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,960
making things that move is how does the

1618
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,040
load shift around in all the different

1619
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,160
positions

1620
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,960
so it will probably be helpful to just

1621
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,920
for me what i normally do is i just

1622
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,680
you know think through all the positions

1623
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,960
it's going to be in

1624
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,119
and then i try to check the things that

1625
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,960
have burned me in the past like oh you

1626
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,200
know i trapped a fastener or i didn't

1627
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,680
make this opening wide enough to get

1628
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,118
tools and things like that

1629
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,200
well jeremy thank you so much i mean

1630
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,559
first of all what i need to thank you

1631
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,280
for is that on your youtube channels you

1632
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,920
are you have spent so much time making

1633
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,000
sure that you go into the educational

1634
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,440
background of the thing and not just the

1635
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,040
building of the thing and i know i've

1636
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,799
learned a ton from it and i've heard

1637
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,720
from a lot of different people who are

1638
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,400
the same way so that is awesome thank

1639
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,720
you so much
