1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,720
i am mike stisch i'm editor-in-chief of

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,639
hackaday it's really nice to be back

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,440
with you today and i have the honor of

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,240
introducing our first keynote uh you

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,679
know we can all

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,440
sense gravity so you know all we have to

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,680
do is like grab something and drop it uh

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,760
but really characterizing that becomes

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,279
difficult and

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,080
like still air and a light breeze

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,640
gravity can actually fluctuate and so

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,039
scientists set out to measure this more

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,520
precisely about two decades ago and in

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,840
order to do so it takes things that are

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,079
really large in scale really low in

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,559
temperature really high speed and of

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,360
course

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,079
ridiculously precise oh and you know you

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,840
need some software to run them as well

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,320
and in this case uh a custom flavor of

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,079
linux is part of that

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,160
dr keith thorne is a group leader at

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,199
ligo livingston observatory so ligo is

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,719
the instrument that's being used to make

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,039
these measurements it stands for laser

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,280
interferometer gravitational wave

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,879
observatory

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,600
he's part of a team who is literally

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,159
observing ripples in space time and i

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,360
just can't

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,760
believe how cool it is to say that

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,479
it's my pleasure today to introduce

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,280
hecate ramoticon keynote speaker dr

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,720
keith thorne

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,320
thank you very much

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,040
for that introduction oh yes i'm keith

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,159
thorne

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,520
um

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,520
answer uh first it actually has been

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,439
about 40 years we've been trying to do

41
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,360
this but who's counting

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,640
uh

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,240
thank you very much i'm actually here at

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
the ligo observatory

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
uh because someone set up the lighting

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,520
so it works

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,439
and uh i don't have broadband at home

48
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,759
right now durable hurricane anyway i'm

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,960
going to start my talk tell you about

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,200
gravity and

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,479
things that correct like black holes

52
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,720
neutron stars and all the great stuff

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,119
we've seen and how the interferometer is

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,560
and then about halfway through the talk

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,320
i'm going to change gears

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,439
and tell you

57
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,360
that we're hackers too

58
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,759
and all the great hacks we've done in

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,479
ligo to make this work hope it's a

60
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,038
little inspiration to you that

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,959
even we big scientists we do it too

62
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,720
so i'm gonna

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,680
go and get over to my uh presentation

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
here

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
talks about why go

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,760
extreme instruments for extreme

67
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,000
astrophysics

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
so uh first i'm going to

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
take you through something about stars

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,200
and stars always interesting because

71
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,160
basically it's a fight between gravity

72
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,560
pulling the gas in and something pushing

73
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,360
out

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,680
so i learned in astronomy that a star is

75
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,519
pretty much just a balloon

76
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,519
that's inflated by the photon pressure

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,920
from the nuclear fusion core fighting

78
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,760
against the gravitational collapse

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,120
that's sort of neat

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,599
but what happens when the lights go out

81
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,920
when you've used up all the hydrogen and

82
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,760
the helium and whatever

83
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
well depends how big they are

84
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,360
if they're about the size of the sun

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
they end up being what's called a white

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
dwarf

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,519
if they're

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,360
up to 10 times as big as the sun this

89
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,879
air blow off stuff and then become

90
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,000
something more extreme a neutron star

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,840
and that's a really big

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,319
they become a black hole

93
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,440
so what are these extreme things well

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
i'll mention with white dwarfs

95
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,000
we've seen them in telescopes basically

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,080
any star up they're about ace or masses

97
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,360
you get a nova or a supernova it blows

98
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,080
off all the extra mass and gets down to

99
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,239
one and a half solar masses

100
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,239
but at that point it's only 10 000

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,319
kilometers across

102
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,239
and in this case the pressure is

103
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,879
something called electron degeneracy

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,239
that means the electrons can't be in the

105
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,480
same state so they push but they act

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,239
like a pressure

107
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,000
we aren't detecting those with ligo

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,360
though

109
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,400
but then there's something more extreme

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,120
called neutron stars

111
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,360
and here you start with bigger stars

112
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,799
about 10 to 30 solar masses

113
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,560
they pretty much become supernova they

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,879
blow off all their other mass in a big

115
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,519
shell and they get down to like

116
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,400
one to two solar masses and they're much

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,760
more extreme they've blown all the

118
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,639
electrons away so it's just protons and

119
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,358
actually just neutrons all the electrons

120
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,360
absorb into the protons it's all

121
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
neutrons

122
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,759
and it's only 10 kilometers across

123
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,080
and basically they get a very high spin

124
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
very magnetic field

125
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,919
and it's again this

126
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,960
fermi it's called fermi degeneracy that

127
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,320
keeps it from being collapsing

128
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,600
so those are pretty extreme we've

129
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,160
detected them they're hard to pulsars

130
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,600
things like that

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,479
but

132
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,120
you can get more extreme

133
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,040
black holes

134
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,320
if you started at like 30 solar masses

135
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,720
you're going to collapse so fast

136
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,680
even the neutron ain't going to matter

137
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,320
and it's a prediction of generality

138
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,240
that you're going to get down to black

139
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,600
holes

140
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,280
and the collapse is so extreme that even

141
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,960
light can never escape from the event

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,120
horizon which is about 30 kilometers or

143
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,440
so depends on the mass

144
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,120
that would be why we call it black

145
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,759
so it's a singularity of pure gravity or

146
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,479
only like three parameters it's how big

147
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,400
is how massive is it does it have a

148
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,800
charge does it spins

149
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,039
so those are out there but they're very

150
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,320
hard to see

151
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,440
especially something that's black

152
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,800
you can only see it when you have other

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,039
stuff with regular telescopes but we set

154
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,000
out

155
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,240
to it so i mentioned general relativity

156
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,759
you know einstein always comes in on

157
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,440
this

158
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,919
so what did j how did he say the one

159
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,400
thought einstein had over 20 years ago

160
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,520
was that

161
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,280
you can't tell the difference between a

162
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,520
gravitational force

163
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,240
and the fact that that instead of the

164
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
force if you think of like a sheet of

165
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,560
rubber

166
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,880
instead of you being attracted you have

167
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,319
a big dump hole depression in the sheet

168
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,319
of rubber due to the mass and you're

169
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,080
basically orbiting because space-time

170
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,800
itself in three dimensions not two is

171
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,639
bent

172
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,120
and uh as a reminder so i never have to

173
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
worry about general relativity

174
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,639
uh yes you do

175
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,039
do you like your gps telling you where

176
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,479
to go

177
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,160
well if we did not correct for general

178
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,720
relativity from the gps satellites to

179
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,960
the curvature the mass of the earth

180
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,800
they'd be miles off

181
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,000
so you get really lost

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,199
so

183
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,000
and

184
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,280
here's a video to show you it the mass

185
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,919
also bends space and time matter occurs

186
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,639
face time space time then guides mass

187
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,960
especially lighter masses

188
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,479
so for instance we have this very

189
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,360
massive object a little one comes in

190
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,680
orbits around it because space time is

191
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
curved not because it's a particular

192
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
gravitational force

193
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,880
and so

194
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,440
that's that's how it works okay we get

195
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
that in your head that you're warping

196
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,960
space-time

197
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,680
but

198
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,560
something else comes up that's exotic

199
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,880
is what if you have

200
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
two black holes

201
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,479
this isn't that part near each other

202
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,639
this isn't so far-fetched we now

203
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,960
astronomers estimate about 80 of stars

204
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,280
are in binary systems orbiting each

205
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,720
other

206
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,919
and all such orbits decay over time

207
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,479
and eventually they're going to merge um

208
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,680
that is that they do it before the

209
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,199
universe ends first and many times the

210
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,599
universe will end first

211
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,840
but what if there's two massive black

212
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,919
holes eventually using the big word

213
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,000
coalesce okay they just smashed together

214
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,840
and

215
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,759
at the end

216
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,680
they are orbiting at two-thirds the

217
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,440
speed of light

218
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,000
these are objects they're like 20 30

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,759
solar masses

220
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,360
two there's the speed of light and

221
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,680
they're warping mass matter around them

222
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,919
so they're pushing space-time the other

223
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,280
ones push and they're getting in the way

224
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,120
of each other

225
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,599
and when they coalesce

226
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,280
we've observed

227
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,840
three masses of

228
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,240
solar masses of mass goes right to

229
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,879
energy that is you started with you know

230
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,599
something that was total 53 solar masses

231
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,440
you get done it's only 50. where are the

232
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,000
three solar masses of mass well e equals

233
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,879
mc squared so it went to energy

234
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,720
well it didn't go into light

235
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
and what it went into

236
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,800
is

237
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,799
massive ripples in space-time you can

238
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,958
start thinking like you drop a rock into

239
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,919
a puddle pool water and ripples away

240
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,799
okay amplify that and that's where all

241
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,760
the energy's going

242
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
but how do you detect gravitational

243
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,920
waves

244
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,519
um

245
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,800
good question

246
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,360
so here's the only equation

247
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,680
uh we'll have equations after this two

248
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,279
there may be another one

249
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,959
okay einstein predicts this radiation

250
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,560
it has a funny thing if you know about

251
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,040
there's like dipole radiation like for

252
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,839
antennas this happens to be quadrupole

253
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,000
the only thing that really means is that

254
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,839
if you have a static object it doesn't

255
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,160
make gravitational waves it's only have

256
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,000
two moving against each other that you

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,279
get it

258
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,640
acceleration

259
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,440
so we often express it in terms of

260
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,680
something called strain that is how much

261
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,880
is space time stretched relatively

262
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,720
and we write these equations funny

263
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
numbers but the important part of this

264
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,160
equation h is that 10 to the minus 20.

265
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,600
so it's 10 to the minus 20 that's a

266
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,320
decimal point 20 zeros

267
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,279
times whatever the mass of the object is

268
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,279
and that's divided by a solar mass so

269
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,760
times how many solar masses it is

270
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,240
times how far away you are that is this

271
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,279
r versus 10 megaparsecs

272
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,480
so

273
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,680
it

274
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,839
dies off pretty quickly once you get far

275
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,720
away

276
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,160
which is a good thing because to tear

277
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,959
you totally apart

278
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,519
so in fact what happens when you get to

279
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,600
the earth and this is why einstein

280
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
really didn't care

281
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,279
about because you never detect it

282
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,120
it's really small at the earth from

283
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,800
these objects

284
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,320
okay

285
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
those zeros okay meter to a tenth of

286
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,600
human hair is about a factor of a

287
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,800
million

288
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
you divide that by a million

289
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,760
divide that by a trillion

290
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,760
and you get to tend to minus 21 meters

291
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,320
amazingly small so let's just say you

292
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
know this will never work don't worry

293
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,000
about it you'll never be able to detect

294
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,160
them you can't make a telescope to see

295
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,680
this

296
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,000
but apparently some scientists had other

297
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,240
ideas

298
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,959
first one was ray weiss he's one of our

299
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,640
nobel prize winners

300
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,360
he was also one of our first hackers

301
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,279
one thing about his background back in

302
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,399
the 50s

303
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,920
he used to build audio circuits

304
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
and sell them that would clean up the

305
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
pops and clicks from the early hi-fi

306
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,959
records

307
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,720
so we earlier he was doing his own

308
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,959
circuits how to filter this and knowing

309
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,120
how to do this helped him but in this

310
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,720
case he actually assigned this as a

311
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,959
homework problem of course to design

312
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,480
some sort of interferometer because

313
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,399
lasers had just been invented 10 years

314
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,680
ago

315
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
so laser interferometer is actually the

316
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,800
ideal thing to use

317
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,440
but it took us 40 about 34 years to

318
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,320
figure out how to do it

319
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,600
so

320
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,480
here's interferometry 101.

321
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
and uh you even do that we use laser

322
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
rangefinders

323
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,560
uh there's the interference between one

324
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,000
light wave and another you send the

325
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
light wave out you split it in two

326
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,800
pieces it comes back together

327
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
and it's the interference between them

328
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,160
and so if you change the arm length of

329
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,079
one the mirror the light no longer

330
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,639
perfectly cancels there's imprecise

331
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,040
cancellation of the waves

332
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,760
now if you're using white light at about

333
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,040
it's a hundred you can do about a

334
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,519
hundredth of a wavelength or about five

335
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,720
nanometers ten minus nine meters

336
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,800
lasers you can do a lot better because

337
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,160
laser and white is coherent fancy word

338
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,639
for saying it's single phase goes up and

339
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,680
down cohere at the same time and has one

340
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,279
frequency

341
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,360
so if you control that free that

342
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,639
intensity the frequency you can get much

343
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,440
much smaller what we call displacements

344
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,639
you can measure much smaller distances

345
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,320
but you have to control the vibration

346
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,279
everything

347
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,279
so that's basically how the ligo

348
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,200
interfarmer works and i'll

349
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,600
take you through a little picture here

350
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
and you're allowed to go to sleep if

351
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,320
you're not investing in fancy design

352
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,440
uh

353
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,519
but we start with a laser

354
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,000
right now we run about 40 watts is the

355
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
initial laser

356
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,880
so we do that

357
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,920
and we get the 40 watts and then we we

358
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,800
recycle it so you start with 40 watts we

359
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,720
have what are called mode cleaners that

360
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,320
remove all the things that aren't the

361
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,639
one frequency light we we want or

362
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,440
scattered light so we clean it we have a

363
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,519
recycling cavity so now we build up the

364
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,839
power and the power matters because that

365
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,200
helps you with something called shot

366
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,680
noise which we'll talk about later

367
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,000
so you want as much light as possible so

368
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,040
up to five kilowatts just in the input

369
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,560
part now we create something called a

370
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,800
michelson interferometer as we split it

371
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,160
and bring it back

372
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,320
and interesting we always pretty much

373
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
redo the michael's interferometer was

374
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,040
used back before the start of the 20th

375
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,600
century you're just at it to figure out

376
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,160
that there was no luminiferous ether say

377
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,839
that three times fast

378
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,360
but that was the michael samoro is

379
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,320
basically there's no stuff out there in

380
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
space it's just a vacuum

381
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,279
no preferential dimension direction

382
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,920
so we do that but then we make it better

383
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,240
by having these arms called fabry pure

384
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
arms now

385
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,760
the the glycogen primer is pretty big

386
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,680
those arms are four kilometers long

387
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,440
pretty big

388
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,920
but you can make it better because you

389
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,639
make it resonate bounce back and forth

390
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,560
with a half silver beer

391
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,880
almost a thousand times so instead of

392
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,440
being four kilometers it's 4 000

393
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
kilometers effectively and that helps

394
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,839
with your precision as well so and also

395
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,600
you're up to 750

396
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,920
kilowatts of power

397
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,519
and we'll come to that later

398
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,519
so then at the output you bring it back

399
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,560
down

400
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,240
you have more power and they have this

401
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,839
little thing called an output mode

402
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,560
cleaner which is only a box about this

403
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,120
big when diffused silica glass and we

404
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,920
use heat it a little to slightly change

405
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,279
the resonance

406
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,680
so that's sort of the layout of it

407
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,600
and i won't go into too many details we

408
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,760
could go on for ages on that

409
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,639
but

410
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,399
first of all i say

411
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,000
how extreme

412
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,880
is the ligo interferometer

413
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,399
okay i said

414
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,240
four kilometers wrong that means you can

415
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,959
see it from any airplane you can see it

416
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,480
from space

417
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,880
because it we have tunnels with concrete

418
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,959
and they go up four kilometers either

419
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,600
through a desert or a swamp

420
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,920
okay so here's where the precision part

421
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,600
comes in

422
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,560
we measure things to one ten thousandth

423
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,199
the diameter of a proton the one in the

424
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,399
nucleus

425
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,160
that's how small that distance is that

426
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,839
we're measuring

427
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,519
and you should go how can you do that

428
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,880
very carefully

429
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,079
okay

430
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,839
but you get very insane sensitivities

431
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,519
like the we have these resident cavities

432
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,759
mirrors which because we're physicist oh

433
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,360
that's not a mirror

434
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,920
that's a test mass

435
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,079
and the reason it's a test mass is it is

436
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,920
the thing that feels the gravitational

437
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,199
wave

438
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,279
and that's what we're testing is the

439
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,279
distance between them

440
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,560
uh

441
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,600
and it's about 40 kilograms 80 pounds

442
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,680
if you get a little laser you know your

443
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,360
little pen like laser

444
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,320
the photon pressure not the heat

445
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,480
the little photons bouncing off the

446
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,600
mirror

447
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,320
are enough to lock to control that we

448
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,160
can use a feedback loop

449
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,839
that's how sensitive the controls are

450
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,519
you know they're like nanometers or

451
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,759
whatever

452
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:18,880
now

453
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,440
when you get such an extreme control

454
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,720
system to

455
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,600
take out all the motion of everything

456
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,399
we've measured that it damps everything

457
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,920
so well

458
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,120
that that

459
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,600
those mirrors

460
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,000
get to a ground state motion that's

461
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,839
equivalent to 77 nano kill kelvins

462
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,839
there's heart in in this dimension

463
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,560
there's hardly any motion

464
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,800
and they don't freeze it's it's affect

465
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,600
what their effective motion is

466
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,040
so

467
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,240
that's how much we've isolated them from

468
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
everything around them which is very

469
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,680
impressive because they're bolted to the

470
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,480
earth right with suspensions so

471
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,639
isolating from the earth is a is a real

472
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,959
challenge

473
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,799
other extreme things

474
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,079
we use ultra high vacuum uh tendonized

475
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,880
nine to ten torr which is more extreme

476
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,799
than outer space

477
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,720
but what's really extreme is how much of

478
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,640
a volume we have

479
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,599
well the volume we have is basically the

480
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,280
same volume as the certain

481
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,319
supercollider's pipe some largest volume

482
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,439
on earth

483
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,160
at

484
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,799
ultra high vacuum in fact we have parts

485
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,200
of our tube and our tube that goes out

486
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
along the arms is a meter across

487
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
three mil stainless

488
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,440
those arms have not been up from vacuum

489
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,480
since for almost 20 years

490
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,799
which is a good thing because if we

491
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,600
popped a hole in there it would take us

492
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
two years to pump them back down

493
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,919
so we're a little insanely crazy about

494
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,600
our vacuum system and valves

495
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,039
so that's how extreme the ligo

496
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,880
interferometer is

497
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,840
but when you do extreme things extrinsic

498
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,200
you can do extreme astrophysics

499
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,000
here's our latest catalog

500
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,760
of from the what we call the stellar

501
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,600
graveyard we got about 90 mergers

502
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,440
mostly black holes

503
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,679
but some of them are neutron stars we've

504
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,440
seen two or three and those are really

505
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
great because other telescopes can see

506
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,520
them we've even seen odd things where

507
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,840
it's a neutron star and a black hole and

508
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
we're rewriting a lot of science because

509
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,160
we're seeing things no one is they live

510
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,440
theorists predict well you shouldn't see

511
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,200
anything in that mass range and we're

512
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,520
like oh contraire

513
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,880
we saw it you're gonna have to rewrite

514
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
your dang theories

515
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,120
sorry are bad

516
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,520
so that's after our initial runs and

517
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,799
we've been ramping up in performance

518
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,799
but i do want to talk with this neutron

519
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,760
star

520
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,600
the reason this is interesting almost

521
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,720
all the events ligo sees lego's the only

522
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,320
ligo and virgo

523
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,720
are the only instruments that can see it

524
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,240
so you can imagine there's a lot of

525
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,160
convincing to tell people like

526
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,799
sure you saw that those black holes all

527
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,600
sure no one else saw them how do i

528
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,440
believe you

529
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,799
well the belief was finally said is we

530
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,960
saw this binary neutron star that was

531
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,080
pretty close

532
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,919
and when we predicted where it was with

533
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,679
ligo and virgo

534
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,480
the gamma-ray observatories farming

535
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,039
fermi also saw it a couple seconds after

536
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,880
we saw it and then the optical

537
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,520
telescopes went in and said yeah we can

538
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,600
figure out go back in the plates and

539
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,120
yeah there's a big thing that went

540
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,679
neutron stars have an optical thing you

541
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,520
can see them in telescopes

542
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,120
and x-rays

543
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,360
and so they could see them so we said

544
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,440
good you finally believe us now we tell

545
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,520
you we're seeing something

546
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,120
but we could do some really great stuff

547
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,039
with that

548
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,679
one thing is i want to impress on you

549
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,200
how different

550
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,760
gravitational wave detectors are versus

551
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,880
regular telescopes

552
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,799
electromagnetic telescopes that you're

553
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,280
familiar with you know big dishes things

554
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,080
like that you can focus photons you can

555
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,720
focus again you can focus light

556
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,480
so they're very good at angular

557
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,919
resolution

558
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,520
but they're really bad at measuring

559
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,799
distance they can tell you it's over

560
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,280
there but they can't tell you where is

561
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,240
it

562
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,000
how far is it

563
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,600
and so they have a very complicated

564
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,559
scheme

565
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,320
of cepheid variables and various things

566
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,159
they know how much they shouldn't have

567
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,960
in in absolute brightness and so it's

568
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,400
very complicated to measure something

569
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,159
called the hubble constant which is how

570
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,799
fast is space expanding

571
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,720
there are two main measures they've done

572
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,640
they don't agree at present the error

573
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,880
bars don't overlap

574
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,679
now

575
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,120
gravitational waves can't be focused

576
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
and so we don't have much directionality

577
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,159
it's the

578
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,320
the it's not a dipole it's almost

579
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,799
uniform in distance we use timing so we

580
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,799
have to use like your ears to tell you

581
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,120
if you've multiple detectors so some

582
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
time light

583
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,039
speed of light delay tells you which way

584
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,280
is it coming from

585
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,559
but

586
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,640
you s but so we have poor angle

587
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,280
resolution but we measure entire

588
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
waveform the waveform gravitational wave

589
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,960
waveform as the things go together and

590
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
go smack and and go down

591
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,840
because we measure all that and general

592
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
relativity tells us well the ups and

593
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
downs of that tells you how big the

594
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
thing was

595
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,360
well then we just say well how high is

596
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,000
that not the shape of it but how much

597
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,880
the apparent intensity is we're great at

598
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
measuring distance every collision tells

599
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,200
us how far away it was

600
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,039
so we're great at measuring the hubble

601
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,320
constant

602
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,919
and we'll get better and here's a

603
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,960
comparison latest measure from ligo

604
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,039
if you look at this plot you'll see that

605
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,320
there's the plank and shoes are the two

606
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,679
optical

607
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,960
or

608
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,799
um optical measurements and they don't

609
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,000
agree those are like error bars one says

610
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,520
oh about 76 one says no it's like 68.

611
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,360
but then even from our first neutron

612
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,000
star the black one we could measure it

613
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,320
and now we can take our black holes add

614
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,000
them all together and the blue is the

615
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,360
latest one so

616
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
we're getting competitive

617
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,640
we're favoring one particular

618
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,320
measurement but there's an uncertainty

619
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,960
there so we hope when we get more we may

620
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,240
help resolve this whole issue

621
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,200
so okay

622
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,960
told you all about a great discoveries

623
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,720
we'll be doing more

624
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,280
but i want to switch gears now

625
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,799
and tell that we do hacking too

626
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,840
just let you know nothing

627
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,159
once why do we do this the ligo staff is

628
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,840
quite so the lab itself only has like

629
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,679
180 people

630
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,679
we have a lot of customers but aren't

631
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,440
that many people in the instrument

632
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,000
but they're very clever people

633
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,320
and we're always solving novel problems

634
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,960
that i've seen elsewhere there's no acme

635
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,039
interferometer country company you can

636
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,799
order stuff from

637
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,039
and because we're doing taxpayers we use

638
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,960
a lot of off the shelf hardware as much

639
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,320
as possible

640
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,520
and so

641
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,840
we to make the precision we've had to do

642
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,080
several hacks i'll give you a few

643
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,919
examples of those

644
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,559
we've had to do software hacks

645
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,400
electronic hacks

646
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,280
mechanical hacks and quantum mechanical

647
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,039
hacks

648
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,799
okay and i like to do this because i

649
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,320
haven't really get to talk about this

650
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,600
much

651
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,400
so

652
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,559
what was the first software hack

653
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,720
and roll fork and alex ivanov came up

654
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
with this i just use it

655
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,960
okay the real hack was how do we do

656
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,200
hard real-time computing and what does

657
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,320
hard mean

658
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,640
well first why do we have to do it we

659
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,440
use what's called digital filtering to

660
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
control the interferometer feedback

661
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
loops high-pass filters

662
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,679
so you're you're running at a certain

663
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,000
frequency and sampling the data

664
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,320
okay we've gone with off-the-shelf

665
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,600
computers so we can change rapidly and

666
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,520
ride moore's law to faster performance

667
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,000
we used to have very custom computers

668
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,880
with insanely expensive compilers

669
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
and stuff like that but linux was coming

670
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,600
on

671
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,240
recently so now the standard real-time

672
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,919
operating systems real-time linux things

673
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,799
like that

674
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,559
they're pretty good cycle times but they

675
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,960
have this tail and the tail is what

676
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,480
kills you there's a long tail of rare

677
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,799
cycles up to one millisecond

678
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,320
the problem is

679
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
the wire control loops have to go from

680
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,919
reading a d converter to outputting a d

681
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,559
to a converter for the control at 64

682
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,039
kilohertz at 16 microseconds

683
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,440
and we can't run long that is skip a

684
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,640
cycle for uh days

685
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,520
so

686
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,559
that's hard real time

687
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,760
so the question was how do you do that

688
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,000
okay

689
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,320
we use a trick

690
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,919
the trick is

691
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,400
run your code on one of the idle cpus

692
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,840
now that you compute

693
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,720
cpus with multiple cores

694
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,000
you can turn flag when the cpus is idle

695
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
so the the os won't use it because

696
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,840
you're saving energy

697
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,440
but the trick is

698
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,679
you load your core as the item loop on

699
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,760
that processor means it's powered up you

700
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,000
don't turn it off you're running it's

701
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,799
just the ios doesn't know you're there

702
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,919
and

703
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,000
you don't get interrupted if you work

704
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,840
hard you have to work very hard to turn

705
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,000
off all the interruptions in the

706
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,039
original hardware we had to turn off you

707
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,640
can't let the computer slow down none of

708
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,960
that energy saving stuff

709
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,279
no hyper threading

710
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,240
no

711
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,080
turbo mode

712
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,000
you had we had to turn off the usb ports

713
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,919
on these things ps2 because they

714
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,600
generate interrupts and you have to tell

715
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,480
the i operating system no no don't knock

716
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,760
on the door

717
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,240
um the see if we're awake or not

718
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,960
so we got that to work

719
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,640
and uh it's interesting when you did

720
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,799
that because we were doing that and we

721
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,720
were using a

722
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,080
pca bus reflective memory for co-located

723
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,480
to exchange data between computers and

724
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
we're using gps's and when we came up

725
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,720
with this we were asked to talk to a

726
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,120
bunch of linux gurus in germany i'm like

727
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,440
why is that then we found out the other

728
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,039
people who want to do something this

729
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,960
extreme

730
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,720
fast stock traders

731
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,240
so i sort of feel bad that after we show

732
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,760
them this trick

733
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,360
that we're gonna be the responsibility

734
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,440
for the next flash crash

735
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,880
so uh

736
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,919
that's the trick we've used

737
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:34,799
now

738
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,720
and you also you make the software very

739
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,559
simple it isn't one of these multiple

740
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,320
loops with threads

741
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,039
single thread is very simple

742
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,440
all it does is it sits waiting for a

743
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,159
trigger that the adcs of new data reads

744
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,799
the data updates all the filters puts

745
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,039
stuff out in memory for d-day converters

746
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,720
just goes back to the top

747
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,039
that's all it does very simple

748
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,840
now it has to do other things like put

749
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,080
out data for other things control

750
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,039
respond the user inputs and so what you

751
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,600
do is you spread those in tiny pieces

752
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,559
across the 64 000 cycles per second

753
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,360
small enough so no time does it exceed

754
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,960
your 16 microsecond time budget

755
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,880
you have to run in kernel mode

756
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,720
um which means you can't do those nice

757
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,240
math libraries if you want math you

758
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,000
gotta write yourself

759
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,200
um

760
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,880
and you can only communicate through

761
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,399
memory buffers

762
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,159
so you have to have and you hand off the

763
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,039
memory and so use dma direct memory

764
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,120
access a lot so you just put it there

765
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,360
and the adc's the data a converter pull

766
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,679
it out or the adc's put it there that's

767
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,360
how you talk to all the other process

768
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,279
you have that aren't real time to talk

769
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,440
to users and export data

770
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,840
so it

771
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,600
worked we had another hack

772
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,360
same people

773
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,720
it was

774
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,039
how do you write the code the amount of

775
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,320
control software we're going to need for

776
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,559
like 100 different processes it's way

777
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,000
more than the two people we had you

778
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,840
can't be staying there overnight and

779
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,679
you know trying to look at requests from

780
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,679
users and write it

781
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,480
but it turns out it's all very similar

782
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,799
it's all got one filter we use very

783
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,240
standard filters it's all how you

784
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,320
package them and run the wires so it's

785
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,080
like a circuit

786
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,919
and in fact

787
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,679
it's a certain so if you could write a

788
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,200
code generator if you could get

789
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,159
something that described this and you

790
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,360
wrote the code based on that description

791
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,960
then you could if someone just changed

792
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,240
the description or would write the

793
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,760
program

794
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,640
but

795
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
you know people are right down but what

796
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,399
you really want is a graphical one that

797
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,240
is you want the users to write the code

798
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,960
for you so they can draw it out

799
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,320
and okay you could write your own

800
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,399
graphic package and do all that

801
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,679
but we were already already using matlab

802
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,440
because it has all this great stuff for

803
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,039
digital filtering

804
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,399
so

805
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,600
but it had this other thing called

806
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,279
simulink which we didn't use just sort

807
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,200
of wasn't working well but it's a great

808
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,039
drawing package

809
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,399
so

810
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,159
if you make your own parts be the

811
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,320
filters you put them in the diagram

812
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,679
and you write a parser for that file

813
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,240
you use that to build the code

814
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,799
so you save yourself running your own

815
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,399
graphics package

816
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,480
and we've used that and so now the users

817
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,559
can change the code whenever they want

818
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,320
and all the programmers do is maintain

819
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,399
the code generator they don't do the

820
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,960
individual programs any

821
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,440
those are two big software hacks so

822
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,600
typically here's part of one or

823
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,760
typically complicated so they drew all

824
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,159
this and you parse it and they can put

825
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,840
comments and

826
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
lots of crazy colors

827
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,840
so but they all sort of documented it

828
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,840
so

829
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,200
those are software hacks we have to do

830
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,919
electronics hacks because the major

831
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,640
problem we have is noise electronic

832
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,360
noise anything that is there

833
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,039
persists for a while will show up in our

834
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,640
day so we have to eliminate a lot of

835
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,679
noise so things we did like switching

836
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,000
some power supplies uh uh

837
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,159
you gotta use linear dc supplies and

838
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,640
then we even put them like 50 80 feet

839
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,960
away in another room

840
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,000
so you can't see the switching noise on

841
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,880
the digitizers

842
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,120
uh the computers that you have running

843
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,840
flat out are noisy as heck oh they're in

844
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,600
yet a different room

845
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,240
and use a fiber interconnect to connect

846
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,200
to where the digitizers are

847
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,000
but there's even more subtle things

848
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
we find out that you know you often you

849
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,480
want to synchronize your digitizer so

850
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,240
you have a clock signal going into one

851
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,640
adc read the edge sharp raging edge

852
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,840
you're all locked

853
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,159
ah you can't do that you have a sharp

854
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,080
edging edge in one of these 87

855
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,320
synchronous adc's you pick it up on the

856
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,919
other channel and you screw up

857
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:48,880
everything

858
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,440
so you can't have sharp edges

859
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,960
and so because everything's most you're

860
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
doing analog you're taking analog stuff

861
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,279
digitizing it putting out back and forth

862
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,600
so what you do instead is you make

863
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,120
something called a duotone you have two

864
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,480
oscillators

865
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,360
at

866
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,600
hertz 961 hertz they have one hertz

867
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,240
speed signal you fit the waveform to

868
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,000
figure out where it crosses at the

869
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,600
beginning of the second and that's what

870
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,919
you use for your one pulse per second

871
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,399
timing signal

872
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,159
and then we were finding that we were

873
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,120
getting two hertz and half hertz signals

874
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,799
and they were because

875
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,559
there were leds

876
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,640
nice blinking leds telling you the

877
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,880
timing system is locked

878
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,480
well but they're running all the time

879
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
and and they pull down the ground

880
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,440
ground plane and you pick those up

881
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,600
so in one case if we change the code so

882
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,240
when it's happy it's constant

883
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,640
in some cases the vendor says no they're

884
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,960
going to be that way that's how it is

885
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,200
so you just pop the leds off

886
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,159
um little surface mounts

887
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,320
um another thing is we had photo

888
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,399
detectors so we're trying to pick up

889
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,760
infrared light

890
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,440
and we weren't

891
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,559
big enough to get ultra custom infrared

892
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,159
photo detectors

893
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,919
but you can make a photo infrared photo

894
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,519
detector pretty easily

895
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,519
you get the can that the photo detector

896
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,840
is in and there's a lens on it optical

897
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,000
you cut the lens off

898
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,840
so your engineers get very good at

899
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,559
cutting lenses off photo detector cans

900
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:20,960
okay

901
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,200
then we have some electro mechanical

902
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,240
hacks

903
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
a fast shutter remember i told you

904
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,000
there's a lot of power there we were

905
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
finding out when we would lose the lock

906
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,320
you you the power goes somewhere we

907
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,279
found it was burning holes in the

908
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,519
substrate of the photo detectors so we

909
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,840
needed a vacuum shutter

910
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,799
now it had some requirements

911
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,559
it had to go six millimeters in one

912
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,880
millisecond and block

913
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,440
45 joules of energy now

914
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,559
going uh 45 seconds isn't so hard you

915
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,559
know six millimeters that's like an arm

916
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,159
on a disk drive we started looking at

917
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,159
those again but you had to be a little

918
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,240
beefier because of the 45 joules of

919
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,159
power and so they came up with this

920
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,679
thing that bounces up i'm going to show

921
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,720
this little video

922
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,760
and you'll see it goes should trigger go

923
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,600
bounce up

924
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,320
okay now that's really slow

925
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,360
well that was because we used now to get

926
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,880
that video to make sure it was moving

927
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,519
fast okay we did have to use a a half

928
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,360
million dollar camera

929
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,960
to do this video

930
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,559
but it didn't work

931
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,840
that's what you're doing here at caltech

932
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,600
someone's got one of these cameras

933
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,039
so

934
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,720
you have to design one of those gizmos

935
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,519
and that gets us to

936
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,600
mechanical hacks

937
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,000
we have to fight vibration we see all

938
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
these signals these seismometers pretty

939
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,880
much all the data that we do from ligo

940
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,159
is to tell us that it's not a

941
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,080
gravitational wave that it's a passing

942
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,000
truck that we see

943
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,159
that the truck moved and it got into the

944
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,240
interferometer and things like that and

945
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,120
so we have all these seismometers around

946
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,720
and we're trying to figure out what the

947
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,240
problem is and we're finding a

948
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,080
particular signal

949
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,200
at about 30 hertz and anna maria efler

950
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,320
and arno

951
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,560
pele found this it's used seismometers

952
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
and you like turn hvac on and off and

953
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,719
what is causing it and they found they

954
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,320
isolated it

955
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,719
and you'll see this picture here now the

956
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,800
graphics shows it before and after you

957
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,280
see this picture that's a spring-loaded

958
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,839
mount for an hvac fan now you may see

959
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,839
that circle thing now you may think

960
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,719
that's a rock

961
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,639
that's a mechanical short if you ask a

962
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,359
mechanical engineer okay it's a rock

963
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,639
so we had to find those

964
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,239
another mechanical hack we have to damp

965
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,159
things that are flexing

966
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,000
and so you have this thing as vibrating

967
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,839
you're picking up that vibration so you

968
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,159
want to have like a tuned mass damper

969
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,199
or or semi-tuned and so there's a lot of

970
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,520
creativity it's gotta be in vacuum and

971
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,280
so one mechanical engineer came up with

972
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,599
all these designs of different pieces of

973
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,320
viton with cable ties of different

974
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,800
designs that would work and much testing

975
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,280
he said the poofy hat worked

976
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
and now the hawaiian like the hawaiian

977
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,680
uh hat sort of worked except it probably

978
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,880
droop

979
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,000
um but that so yeah we we don't use

980
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,920
cable ties use something ultra vacuum

981
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,560
brian lance came up with this

982
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,200
so that's one of our hacks

983
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,240
so

984
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
another one was

985
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,040
cryo baffle dampers recently you have a

986
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,800
baffle to baffle white but it's inside

987
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,160
the tube

988
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,320
and it's bouncing around and you have

989
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,760
something called eddy current dampers

990
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,240
for the slow stuff but not impulses

991
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,680
so what do you do well you get more

992
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,040
squidgy bits

993
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,200
and you put them like back up against

994
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,040
each other to keep the thing from

995
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,560
bouncing

996
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,640
arnold came up with that one and the

997
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,680
final one are acoustic mode dampers

998
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
it turns out we had a problem that the

999
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,640
mirrors

1000
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,320
the mirrors do vibrate you know like

1001
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,000
they have drum modes and if that

1002
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,839
frequency is the same as a resonant

1003
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,960
frequency for the optical system you get

1004
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,320
runaway

1005
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,599
um you know

1006
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,320
amplification uh parametric instability

1007
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,920
and we had all system to do that but

1008
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,000
then a really clever uh mechanical

1009
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,720
sebastian biscan came up with you use

1010
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,359
tiny little piezoelectric dampers

1011
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,040
designed for that frequency range and

1012
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,960
they oscillate the other way to help

1013
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,160
damp it

1014
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,480
and here it is this tiny little thing

1015
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,440
glued onto the side of the big mirror

1016
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,720
the only difficult part is you want to

1017
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,839
make sure it didn't fall off so it was

1018
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,839
very you had to go in there and like

1019
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,240
push it and glue it on and make sure you

1020
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,839
have glue that it's not going to come

1021
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,000
off

1022
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,240
so last hack

1023
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,760
quantum hack

1024
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,920
squeeze light

1025
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,720
um

1026
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,560
this is our

1027
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,760
our noise curve it's logarithmic and

1028
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,800
frequency logarithmic and strain

1029
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
and it has pretty much all these curves

1030
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,079
have something at the lower frequency

1031
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,400
sometimes one over f noise but it's a

1032
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,560
combination of things here and then it

1033
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,040
goes up at high frequency

1034
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,880
and that going up at high frequencies is

1035
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,640
often called shock noise johnson noise

1036
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,359
it turns out that's a quantum effect

1037
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,599
the effect is that because light is

1038
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,280
quantized oh yeah einstein said that too

1039
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,160
uh because it's quantized as you go

1040
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,760
above from frequency there's only so

1041
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,160
many photons and so you have tiny

1042
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
smaller and smaller boxes when you're

1043
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,680
measuring the wave waveform for a photon

1044
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,839
to be in so depending how bright the

1045
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,839
light is you don't digitize it too well

1046
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,280
so you have big uncertainty in the

1047
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,920
intensity or the phase

1048
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,240
and so this is sort of

1049
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,240
it limits how well you can measure

1050
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,359
things

1051
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,599
and so it's and it's only limited by how

1052
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,359
much power you can use

1053
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,720
and now this other thing called

1054
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,480
radiation pressure at low frequency but

1055
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,880
we'll worry about the shot noise and so

1056
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,200
you can fix it by cranking up the laser

1057
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,680
but you crank up the laser white now

1058
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,760
bounces everywhere gets back in screws

1059
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,440
you up so what you really want to do is

1060
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,400
beat

1061
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,680
that shot noise push down without

1062
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,599
raising the laser

1063
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,480
so how do you do that

1064
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
you do that

1065
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,560
if i can get this to go

1066
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,200
okay so i wanted to advance

1067
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,720
okay

1068
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,880
all right let's try this

1069
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,000
there we go

1070
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,160
okay

1071
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,000
now these vacuum fluctuations and here

1072
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,599
it's getting a little deep

1073
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,359
so i'll try and make it quick this

1074
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,280
quantum noise is actually from

1075
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,119
quantization that like magnetic

1076
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,400
something called a zero point

1077
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,680
fluctuation

1078
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,320
but the important part to note is it's

1079
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,920
the heisenberg uncertainty principle

1080
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,599
coming in here the things we want to

1081
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,240
measure out this light is the amplitude

1082
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,520
how big it is

1083
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,760
and the phase you know where where does

1084
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,599
it go up and down and in fact in this

1085
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,280
thing we really care about the phase

1086
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,960
because that tells us how long the arm

1087
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,760
is

1088
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,560
now in normal uncertainty

1089
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,800
you have these two variables

1090
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,760
the

1091
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,560
joint uncertainty of them is always has

1092
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,800
to be greater than some sun so you get

1093
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,079
this circle

1094
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,320
between x1 is between phase and

1095
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,560
amplitude so circular and so

1096
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,800
on average you can never get better than

1097
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,280
a certain precision in phase or in

1098
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,640
amplitude

1099
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,079
and so

1100
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,200
that sets the limit for shot noise

1101
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,880
but

1102
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,040
what if it isn't a circle

1103
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,359
and so what the hack is

1104
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,440
is you use something called squeezed

1105
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,079
vacuum yes it's getting pretty deep here

1106
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,800
but the important part to use we measure

1107
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,119
we take the light we basically measure

1108
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,440
how the light's going back and forth and

1109
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,240
we rotate the uncertainty so it's no

1110
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,760
longer

1111
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,040
symmetric then in fact we we take this

1112
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,119
area has to say the same

1113
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,440
so we squeeze it

1114
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,760
so that all the uncertainty is in the

1115
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
amplitude we don't care about but

1116
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,920
there's much less uncertainty in the

1117
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,119
phase which is what we do care about

1118
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,079
and so when you do this you can beat and

1119
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,920
improve by several db

1120
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,839
60b or so

1121
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,760
bad uncertainty

1122
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,960
so that was our quantum hack

1123
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,000
so that brings me to the end

1124
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,839
of my

1125
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,400
talk

1126
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,599
uh

1127
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,280
but i just wanted to say thank you very

1128
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,400
much

1129
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,760
um

1130
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,160
i'll take this i think we want to maybe

1131
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,960
have some questions after this

1132
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,680
so let me stop my share

1133
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,040
spectacular presentation keith thank you

1134
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,240
so much

1135
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,000
uh so we have a ton of really good

1136
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
questions in the channel and i'm going

1137
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,560
to get to those but i have one on my

1138
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,760
mind that

1139
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,520
i i don't i'm not really able to

1140
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,800
reconcile

1141
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,400
um can you describe

1142
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,160
like the speed of the gravitational

1143
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,839
waves like i know you run the

1144
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,680
installation for a long period of time

1145
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,079
okay that that was that's actually a

1146
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,079
question and one thing i didn't put in

1147
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,319
here is a lot of things we said about

1148
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,800
general relativity by by measuring these

1149
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,400
gravitational waves

1150
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,160
and the one thing we did with that

1151
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,400
neutron star detection is the speed of

1152
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,280
gravity is the speed of light

1153
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,720
there's a lot of alternate theories

1154
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,160
about general relativity they say it

1155
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,800
goes faster or smaller but because we

1156
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,000
saw the signal with our detector

1157
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,079
and the gamma-ray burst people saw it

1158
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,560
like a second or two later

1159
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,800
basically over that great distance

1160
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,560
gravitational waves move to move at the

1161
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,680
speed of light and we improved it

1162
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,119
which actually threw out a whole bunch

1163
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:37,920
of

1164
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,119
um crazy theories people came up with

1165
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,800
does that answer your question yes

1166
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
absolutely it says the speed and white i

1167
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,079
like everything

1168
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,920
um another one and these are no

1169
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,359
particular order but they are they are

1170
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,960
all interesting questions um you

1171
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
mentioned putting uh

1172
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,200
the test masses making them extremely

1173
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,480
cold

1174
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,160
and isolating

1175
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,000
we they act like they're called we are

1176
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,640
actually freezing them that it's a it's

1177
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,880
you've reduced their vibration so

1178
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,359
effectively but you aren't actually like

1179
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,040
chilling them

1180
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,720
so it's it's

1181
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,119
yeah they say it as if it had the amount

1182
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,760
of residual motion of 77 as if they were

1183
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,960
that cold

1184
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,480
right and there's mostly because we're

1185
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,760
damping them

1186
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,000
yeah and isolating from seismic effects

1187
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,200
so you showed some of some of the

1188
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,839
dampening of that but the question is do

1189
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,800
you have to account for earth's motion

1190
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,000
oh yes what we have we have to adapt for

1191
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,440
the tides

1192
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,280
believe it or not

1193
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,839
that the tides move stuff so we actually

1194
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,720
have a slow loop that adjusts for the

1195
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,520
tides adjusting our thing so we we don't

1196
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,599
have to the earth so it's mostly the

1197
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,000
tides we have to correct for

1198
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,319
so we have a title a list very small

1199
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,520
slow loop

1200
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,599
you know for every 12 hours that adjusts

1201
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,000
the tidal motion that affects the length

1202
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,440
of our arms

1203
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,200
so yes we don't have to correct for the

1204
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,480
earth itself but for these these uh

1205
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,839
effects from the tides

1206
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,640
that is wild let's see um you mentioned

1207
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,480
damping the mirror and there's a

1208
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,760
question um on that a little bit so the

1209
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,280
question was actually on the runaway

1210
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,839
amplification right

1211
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:18,560
it's

1212
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,800
okay what's happening is

1213
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,400
you have

1214
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,640
there's optical frequencies in the

1215
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
interferometer and you get energy in

1216
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,720
that and the problem is if they're over

1217
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,680
here

1218
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,920
then you can damp them with one way but

1219
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,640
if but then you have a physical mass

1220
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,960
and physical masses have drum modes they

1221
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,000
go like this and they go like this and

1222
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,040
and if the mechanical mode lines up with

1223
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,760
the optical mode as you heat the thing

1224
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,680
up and that's what amplifies mechanical

1225
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,160
mode you got you cranked up the laser

1226
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,560
then it's right at the optical frequency

1227
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,599
so the problem is that you can't damp

1228
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,599
this optical one anymore because you're

1229
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,640
amp you're hitting it with a mechanical

1230
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,440
so

1231
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,359
there's various things you can do if you

1232
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,160
heat

1233
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,880
the you can change the temperature with

1234
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,400
heaters of the mass and so they don't

1235
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,800
overlap anymore but in some cases you

1236
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,599
can

1237
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,079
so it's called a parametric instability

1238
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,079
because it just it's a runaway feedback

1239
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,240
group

1240
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,160
um

1241
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,640
this one is uh a question on the

1242
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,640
waveform so the the question is um

1243
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,720
uh i didn't quite get how the distance

1244
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,599
is embedded in well the way the distance

1245
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,440
is embedded is

1246
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,079
you do the theory if it's this big the

1247
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,480
waveform it's the variation of how it

1248
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,280
goes up and down and the time

1249
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,160
okay

1250
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,880
so i i can show but basically if it's

1251
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,079
more massive it takes longer

1252
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,560
and you can you can we do the fits we

1253
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,240
measure the waveform

1254
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,920
well for neutron stars we measure for

1255
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,800
like 20 minutes but for we measure it

1256
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,720
for a second or so

1257
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,280
you that extended waveform if you solve

1258
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,720
what equations

1259
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,160
what would it look like when it goes

1260
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,480
together what we'll look like and

1261
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,960
how the ratio of how fast it goes up

1262
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,680
does it have some extra bits in it

1263
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,520
how long is it between each part in time

1264
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,359
and the relative heights and that when

1265
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,040
you solve the equations that will tell

1266
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,240
you

1267
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,720
that it was like a collision of 30 solar

1268
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,440
mass star with a 10 solar mass sorry

1269
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,880
black hole

1270
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,880
and either they were spinning or not you

1271
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,720
can have some information on that the

1272
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,400
more precisely you measure that the

1273
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,839
better you do

1274
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,000
so it's the shape

1275
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,160
and timing that matter

1276
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,240
and then the absolute signal you see

1277
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,160
here at the earth tells you

1278
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,839
compare and when you do the equation it

1279
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,440
tells you where it occurred what the

1280
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,760
absolute magnitude is

1281
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,839
you know which is way more than here but

1282
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,920
then how big is it when it gets to here

1283
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,160
and by that one over r that tells you

1284
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:54,960
how

1285
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,720
far away you are

1286
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,839
how much is decayed away

1287
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,920
uh another good question the uh

1288
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,839
hard real time system that you were

1289
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,000
talking about is that available is the

1290
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,240
code for that available it's probably

1291
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,960
it's it's actually quite simple um code

1292
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,280
i think we've put it on our remote co

1293
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,240
we've just put it on get got ligo.org

1294
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,160
i think it's mostly public now it's

1295
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,240
actually pretty pretty simple that it's

1296
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,200
uh

1297
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,359
it used to put a hook in your code but

1298
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,440
yes it is we've been trying to make our

1299
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,720
code public

1300
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,319
not just because work but we're going to

1301
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,920
be working with people in india and

1302
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,960
whatever

1303
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,839
and so uh yeah there's a git.mygood.org

1304
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,000
and i think there's a public part of it

1305
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,920
and we'll work on putting a link to that

1306
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,480
in in yeah can we can do all that work

1307
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,480
we're trying to make it also we have a

1308
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,040
lot going on with packaging so it's much

1309
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,280
easier for people to install it

1310
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,440
for test stands and things

1311
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,599
um the other piece you have to do is

1312
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,760
these memory buffers because you know

1313
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,440
you you have to put things in so there's

1314
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,960
a lot of tricks but it's all in there

1315
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,319
but yes we are trying to make it all

1316
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,520
public i think we currently use uh

1317
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,280
a custom version we take

1318
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,240
a modification of of a dev a real-time

1319
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,440
patch to uh debian 10 right now working

1320
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,280
on 11 but we've used gen 2 before

1321
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,200
eric

1322
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,440
uh this is a question about geology and

1323
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,280
i actually had a question i can do that

1324
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,240
well

1325
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,599
we'll see so

1326
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,000
two two things the first one is uh does

1327
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,920
geology of the location of ligo

1328
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,119
introduce things that have to be

1329
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,480
corrected for

1330
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,079
and the other one is can you talk about

1331
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,640
that there was a band on the globe when

1332
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,079
you were talking about locations and

1333
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,520
talk about what that band is showing

1334
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,280
well that band was

1335
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,319
if you

1336
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,119
that band was uncertainty um i think can

1337
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,839
go back to that but first geology yes

1338
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,359
we're in a swamp

1339
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,599
and so and we'll close the ocean so in

1340
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,920
fact we had to put in more seismic

1341
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,079
isolation here at our site

1342
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,599
in louisiana

1343
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,839
to damp out we actually were planning it

1344
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,359
for both sites we actually put it in

1345
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,559
here early

1346
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,280
so where your site is matters

1347
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,960
it's actually it's more seismically

1348
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,079
quiet in terms of of uh

1349
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,280
of uh ripples from like water and thing

1350
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,800
in here

1351
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,520
but

1352
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,640
in

1353
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,760
the high desert of hanford

1354
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,760
they don't have a problem with the

1355
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,839
ground moving

1356
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,680
except for those earthquakes

1357
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,160
but they also have a problem with wind

1358
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,480
they have a much higher wind velocity

1359
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,240
and the problem is wind will take these

1360
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,319
buildings and tilt them

1361
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,880
and so they've even started erecting

1362
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,319
wind fences

1363
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,640
on these build across buildings so they

1364
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,000
don't tilt

1365
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,520
so

1366
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,040
the now below you it's pretty simple

1367
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,359
um geology does affect you part of the

1368
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,680
low frequency problem is

1369
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,079
you aren't on a flat earth the earth is

1370
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,359
curved and so as you go to lower low

1371
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,040
frequency you're probing farther and

1372
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,960
farther distances on the earth in terms

1373
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,520
of mass and it's falling away from you

1374
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,359
it's something called a gravity gradient

1375
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,880
and so because we're on the earth that

1376
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,680
affects our low frequency performance

1377
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,960
uh

1378
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,240
and i've probably forgotten the thread

1379
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,839
of the rest of the part

1380
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,680
so it's geology

1381
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,119
and what was the second half of the

1382
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,440
question oh you already uh the band on

1383
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,119
the no the band on the there is it turns

1384
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,079
out if you only have two interferometers

1385
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,839
that's why you need three

1386
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,240
you you get you can get an uncertainty

1387
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,960
like a ring uncertainty as you have two

1388
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,800
and you can say it's like here here here

1389
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,119
here here so part of it is you needed to

1390
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,800
have

1391
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,040
i have to go back to let me go look at

1392
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,839
that one um there are several bands but

1393
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:45,839
that may have a different band

1394
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,319
um i remember that graphic i think it

1395
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,079
was the news

1396
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,319
i can describe it okay

1397
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,559
that was actually an uncertainty from

1398
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,000
two instruments

1399
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,480
i got it so that was not actually the

1400
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,599
ligo

1401
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,599
but we do have that's why we need three

1402
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,680
because you have two you've you can get

1403
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,839
an uncertainty and so you need a third

1404
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,240
instrument to say you know and you get

1405
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,240
something here but like you can't say

1406
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,839
it's down here or up here so a third

1407
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,760
instrument refines it that's why you

1408
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,079
really need multiple interferometers but

1409
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,760
i think that one was because they only

1410
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,960
had two

1411
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,559
um instruments and they could tell a

1412
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,240
distance and so

1413
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,920
the ring was

1414
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,520
the the where

1415
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,000
on the cosmic actually it wasn't the

1416
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,400
earth that was actually a picture of the

1417
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,760
cosm of the

1418
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,920
celestial

1419
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,200
i'm going to combine two different

1420
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,720
questions here because they're kind of

1421
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,040
deal with shielding um so

1422
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,480
one of them says you know you mentioned

1423
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,400
the computers are in another room

1424
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,359
um

1425
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,359
are they shielded with copper tape or

1426
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,960
something more exotic and the other

1427
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,119
question is is there anything specific

1428
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,800
with electronics to protect against

1429
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
cosmic rays and electromagnetic

1430
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,200
radiation yeah there's been some

1431
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,520
thing of that um we don't do too much

1432
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,920
copper i mean what we do is we use

1433
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,000
linear power supply so you have a big

1434
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,160
like locomotive cable right

1435
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,920
so you want to reduce that that's for

1436
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,880
the dc power

1437
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,880
the thing from the computers is there's

1438
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,400
electronic noise but it's actually

1439
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,240
acoustic

1440
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,960
um because they're running flat out and

1441
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,359
in fact we have racks of electronics

1442
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:20,160
that are somewhat near the

1443
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,640
interferometer we've had to put it's not

1444
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,720
just the electronic noise it's the

1445
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,079
vibration doing the concrete slab that's

1446
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,559
separate but it gets transmitted through

1447
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,200
the foil and so we put in

1448
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,000
um

1449
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,040
rubber

1450
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,640
things are just the right so they aren't

1451
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,800
compressed and they aren't just rocking

1452
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,520
just enough so they damp out this

1453
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,040
vibrating rack of electronics

1454
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,880
i'm not sure i answered that

1455
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,720
question but um

1456
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,640
the copper

1457
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,079
i understood where the copper would come

1458
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,040
in

1459
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,800
oh like uh putting computers in another

1460
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,119
room and then shielding the room i think

1461
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,599
oh yes we have thought of we are going

1462
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,119
to do this we are

1463
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,880
what we're going to do we think we've

1464
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,040
got the noise of one of our most

1465
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,359
critical digitizers we're actually going

1466
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,960
to try that we're actually going to put

1467
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,760
it

1468
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,319
in its own box and try to make making a

1469
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,640
faraday cage is actually very hard if

1470
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,839
there's any

1471
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,319
aperture the waves will find it in it's

1472
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,720
really hard to make a foolproof faraday

1473
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,000
cage

1474
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,319
um

1475
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,400
uh the

1476
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,240
i would like to give you some feedback

1477
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,680
and saying that

1478
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,200
you were wondering if the hacks would be

1479
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,960
well received and someone was asking

1480
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,800
about quantum squeezing before you got

1481
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
to that and then they're like yes

1482
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,720
quantum's confusing

1483
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,359
yes and so and we're doing a little more

1484
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,440
now um the little detail i guess i

1485
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,800
didn't want to take up john

1486
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,200
that squeezing i showed you is frequency

1487
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,720
independent it's the same

1488
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,520
and it turns out that what happens is

1489
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,440
when you squeeze at high frequency it

1490
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,280
helps the high frequency but you don't

1491
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,640
get something for nothing and so the

1492
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,760
problem is

1493
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,520
high frequency gets better but low

1494
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,920
frequency gets worse and it is sort of

1495
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,319
impinging on the low frequency

1496
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,319
the way you can solve that is by having

1497
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,280
another resonant cavity that rotates it

1498
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,359
so there's no squeezing at zero

1499
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,680
frequency and full squeezing at high

1500
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,359
frequency

1501
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,200
but to do that you have to make a 300

1502
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,839
meter long cavity with a vacuum tube

1503
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,440
this big so we're doing construction

1504
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,720
right now

1505
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,920
to go out you know 1000 feet

1506
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,480
out across the swamp

1507
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,640
with concrete and nothing to make

1508
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,839
another

1509
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,319
optic there so that's part of what we're

1510
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,559
doing for the why we're down is putting

1511
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,119
in this enhanced squeezing

1512
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,760
so that we can squeeze much harder at

1513
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,200
high frequency

1514
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,119
but without affecting the low frequency

1515
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,319
getting this back reaction

1516
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,920
i really enjoyed hearing about your

1517
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,960
software hack for uh connecting matlab

1518
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,400
up to yeah

1519
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,079
it'd be nice if they stopped changing

1520
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,000
the file format they're almost

1521
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,160
i think they were we it wasn't so bad

1522
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,640
they they they went to xml we haven't i

1523
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,760
think we're going to have to figure out

1524
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,599
how to parse their xml

1525
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:06,559
um

1526
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:07,680
because they're

1527
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,680
they're our arc

1528
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,960
but that's what happens when you aren't

1529
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,119
writing this software you know

1530
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,319
or you know other huge giant amazing

1531
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,400
installations that are looking to have

1532
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,400
an interface for the scientists what is

1533
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,680
the feedback been from the people that

1534
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,680
are using that system well that well

1535
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,839
they're familiar so it's great because

1536
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,839
we also make it so they can generate the

1537
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,160
software they just design it we can hear

1538
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,520
here's how you build it here's how you

1539
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,680
make it and they just do it and here's

1540
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,680
how you restart the dac otherwise known

1541
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,880
as don't call me no here's here's how to

1542
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,720
do it you can do it and they think it's

1543
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,040
great because they go in they change it

1544
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,640
oh i want a different thing i want to

1545
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,559
add these things they add that in they

1546
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,040
rebuild it they restart it

1547
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,559
now other places use uh virgo the one in

1548
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,280
italy uses digital signal processors

1549
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,559
but of course it's a much smaller

1550
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,119
community that can write those

1551
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,680
and so you don't quite have the same

1552
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,760
ability to do it no though it's it's

1553
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,040
outsourcing uh code creation is a

1554
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,319
wonderful thing

1555
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,160
um but no they i don't think we could

1556
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,760
have done it without it because there's

1557
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,799
just

1558
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,319
you know there's you know let's say you

1559
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:15,520
have 50

1560
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,839
30 scientists doing it you'd never you

1561
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,000
need an army of programmers right and

1562
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,160
they don't have to write software

1563
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,640
they occasionally write some c code for

1564
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,880
some special thing that they want to do

1565
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,200
but pretty much

1566
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,319
it's just wiring

1567
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,640
so i think just one final question and

1568
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,000
and uh

1569
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,599
when you were talking about the laser

1570
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,680
and you said you had a 40 watt laser

1571
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,480
uh

1572
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,359
off the shelf laser and you no no no

1573
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,160
it's it's a very custom designed laser

1574
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,000
it's actually the current one it comes

1575
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,880
from an outfit in germany called neolaze

1576
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,400
and hanover

1577
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,359
and we're doing our latest one is

1578
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,520
it's actually a series of lasers and in

1579
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,839
fact it starts with one and then we have

1580
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,000
pumped light that goes in water cooled

1581
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
things over to a room

1582
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
and it goes to an amplifier so actually

1583
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,319
the amp fire would get up to 70 watts

1584
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,240
and the only reason it's at 40 watts

1585
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,359
right now

1586
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,839
is we're having trouble with the these

1587
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,559
mirrors these mirrors have like any like

1588
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,559
14 anti-reflective coatings another

1589
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,640
custom company that does that but the

1590
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,839
problem is

1591
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,920
they get schmutz on them we found have

1592
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,599
found when they're manufactured they can

1593
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,440
get little particles

1594
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,040
tiny little ones

1595
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,079
they're no trouble when you're

1596
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,160
illuminating it when you crank up the

1597
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,799
power to kilowatts

1598
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:35,920
bang

1599
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,880
and so

1600
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,680
we have bad spots we've had to like

1601
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,559
steer the light away and so is the limit

1602
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,960
we can't go above 40 watts right now but

1603
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,040
it's actually a series you start with an

1604
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,119
n pro laser

1605
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,280
and then you go through uh several a

1606
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,960
pump laser

1607
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,040
and switch it back to infrared

1608
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,960
1024 right now

1609
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,000
and then you uh go through an amplifier

1610
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,200
all custom

1611
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,599
to get up to actually go 35 watts and

1612
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,520
then to 70 watts

1613
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,200
so yeah it's all that's all very custom

1614
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,359
well this has been such a pleasure today

1615
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,520
keith thank you so much for speaking and

1616
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,799
i think i speak for everyone that was a

1617
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,720
wonderful talk and uh we're happy to

1618
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,880
have had you here and i'm glad everybo

1619
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,480
everybody show all your interests in

1620
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,200
ligo of course remember we have hackers

1621
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,440
so we may even be hiring i think i saw

1622
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,160
11 openings last year 13 openings um

1623
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,799
because a lot of us are getting old

1624
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,359
and uh so we're you know retirement

1625
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,599
which is good but we need new people

1626
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,839
so uh but it's gonna be a little bit you

1627
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,680
know you have to fight against spacex

1628
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,440
and tesla and all the other great stuff

1629
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,960
everybody's doing

1630
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,799
so but thank you very much everybody i'm

1631
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,680
glad we enjoyed it
