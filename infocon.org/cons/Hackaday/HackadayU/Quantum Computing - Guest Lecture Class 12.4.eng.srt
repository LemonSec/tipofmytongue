2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,200
thank you everyone for joining us

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,240
this is our 24th session at hackaday

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,160
quantum computing class and

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,840
we have our fourth guest lecture today

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,080
we're very honored to have professor

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,240
chris ferry joining us

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,880
just a reminder that all of our content

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,439
is

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,279
on the hackaday quantum computing

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,480
through comics

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,280
project you can find all the materials

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,920
and

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,120
the drawings and powerpoint slides

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,480
recording all there as

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,640
people who have been joining the class

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,520
know

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,800
we spent from 30 minutes to an hour

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,600
every sunday on one topic

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,160
and we'll be using the quantum computing

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,000
documentation for microsoft

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,960
and the quantum code has four exercises

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,160
since

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,280
september we started inviting some

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,400
professionals experts in specific fields

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,840
to talk about their areas of studies

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,479
and today we have professor chris ferry

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,680
joining us

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,159
teaching us about quantum tomography

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,960
chris is a well-known puppet and

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,159
he is a professor in

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,200
university of technology sydney

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,520
and he's also part of the center for

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,400
quantum

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,600
software and information there and

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,159
chris will be teaching us something

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,200
about

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,840
the internal working of quantum

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,960
computers

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,479
and if you get a quantum device

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,880
how do you prove that it is actually a

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,079
quantum device

43
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,520
so is kind of a unique

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,719
and mind-boggling problem

45
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,680
that he will shy some light on today and

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,640
as many of you

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,960
know that chris also is a author for

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,239
many publications including

49
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,160
the very famous children's series book

50
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,879
you might have seen mark zuckerberg

51
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,879
taken a photo of

52
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,760
reading his book quantum computing for

53
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,360
children for babies

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
uh for his baby so uh

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,160
chris has this whole series of wonderful

56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,440
books that you should check

57
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,920
check out i know a lot of you would like

58
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,560
to

59
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,599
buy his books for your children

60
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,440
and a reminder all of the

61
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,640
recordings from today and passed will be

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,720
posted on hackaday as well as

63
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
my youtube channel and hacker day has

64
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,080
been uploading

65
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,720
the videos on the hackaday playlist as

66
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,959
well

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,680
just a reminder next week we don't have

68
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,120
a class

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,760
thanks everyone for also joining late

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
especially people in europe are staying

71
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,879
up late for this

72
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,599
and thank you chris for joining us super

73
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,519
early in the morning on your monday in

74
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,239
sunny yes you got your coffee

75
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,920
well prepared and then next week we have

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,360
a break then november 2nd we will have

77
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,640
dr michael bieberland come to us to talk

78
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,440
about

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,680
quantum error correction that's also one

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,640
of the

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,480
most interesting topics from this

82
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,680
audience

83
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,959
okay without further ado i will give the

84
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,080
presentation to chris welcome chris

85
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
thank you for joining

86
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,799
yes thank you for inviting me um this

87
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,519
should be

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,720
it should be fun i'm excited to see your

89
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
artistic interpretation of quantum

90
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,480
tomography

91
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,519
yeah um yeah

92
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,640
so if if you've read the

93
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,680
uh the abstract then you'll know that

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,200
um have a little story uh

95
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,840
to go along with it i'm imagining the

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,599
audience here

97
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,360
um some some quantum hackers

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,480
some quantum programmers

99
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,000
you've played with a little quantum

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,560
computing um

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,680
i even suggested the idea that maybe you

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,160
even

103
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,479
ran an algorithm so here i'm showing you

104
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,520
um

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,960
the ibm quantum experience and

106
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
this is a teleportation circuit if

107
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,520
if you recognize it um it's teleporting

108
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,080
this

109
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680
this state up here from the

110
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,520
zeroth qubit down to the last qubit um

111
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,919
and um and the

112
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,720
it's a it's a y rotation just a

113
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
particular state i mean

114
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,720
nowadays if you want to teleport

115
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,240
something on a real

116
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,400
computer you have to know what state it

117
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
is you're preparing because you're the

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,360
one creating it

119
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,840
in the far future of course we won't

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,639
know

121
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,080
what the description of states are

122
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,639
but today we need to know what they are

123
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,639
so i know that this is a

124
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,080
zero state that's been rotated by

125
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,199
y about the y axis by pi over four

126
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,240
and uh down at the bottom um

127
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
let's see

128
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,000
so down at the bottom here you can see

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,160
um this is the simulation so this is

130
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
exactly what should happen

131
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,400
uh when when all the measurements are

132
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,000
done on all the qubits

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,280
then i should see these probabilities

134
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,880
down here the this is

135
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,680
this is a simulation um so this is what

136
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,039
ought to happen

137
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,080
and i went ahead and i ran this

138
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,720
on ibm's real quantum computer so if you

139
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
use the ibm quantum experience you can

140
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,560
create an algorithm like this

141
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,400
this is a teleportation circuit as i

142
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,319
said and i can click run

143
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,639
up here what happens of course is that

144
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,319
you get placed in a queue

145
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,840
and then your job runs and i did that

146
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,600
in the morning for most of you who are

147
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,080
in in the u.s

148
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,800
last night for me and i checked this

149
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,680
morning and it did run

150
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,039
um so we can see that uh

151
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,560
i was in oh i was in the queue for not

152
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,319
so long um

153
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,440
for one one minute and it took

154
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,560
14 seconds to run the

155
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,240
circuit that algorithm ran of 1024 times

156
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,280
and this are the outcomes here

157
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,479
and you can see that just by i they're

158
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,400
not the same as

159
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,880
the theoretically predicted outcomes so

160
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,120
i'll just split that up one more time

161
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,840
so this was the circuit these were the

162
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,360
theoretically predicted outcomes down

163
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,560
here

164
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,520
21.33 percent

165
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,919
and 3.66

166
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,680
those two values and what happens is

167
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,120
well uh they're not not too far away but

168
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,680
uh certainly not the predicted values

169
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,000
so what went wrong is there

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
is there something wrong with the way i

171
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,000
used this quantum computer

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,840
is there something wrong with my

173
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,880
algorithm

174
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,639
the answer is no in fact the problem

175
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,160
is not on my side it's on the side of

176
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,680
the device so the device

177
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
is not perfect so you've been hearing

178
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,319
about your in your introduction to

179
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,360
quantum computing

180
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,720
about what will happen what ought to

181
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,599
happen

182
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,879
when we have perfect quantum computers

183
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,639
so i guess two weeks time you'll hear

184
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,919
about quantum error correction

185
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,400
which is the kind of the pathway to get

186
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,960
there

187
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
but right now we're not at error

188
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,199
corrected quantum computers

189
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,360
we have noisy quantum computers so an

190
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,319
acronym

191
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,840
that you may have heard is nisk nisq

192
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
that stands for noisy intermediate scale

193
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,039
qubits

194
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,879
and what this means is that we have

195
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,960
not large scale quantum computers so

196
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
those would be ones that you would run

197
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
shore's algorithm on to

198
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,160
factor large numbers and we don't have

199
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,879
just small kind of toy devices anymore

200
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,560
we have intermediate scale devices

201
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,519
devices that do something interesting

202
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,719
from a

203
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,640
scientific point of view maybe not

204
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,000
interesting from a

205
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,120
applications point of view but yet are

206
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,919
still

207
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,320
noisy so they don't actually

208
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,600
perform the circuit that you ask them to

209
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
perform

210
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,880
and what i want to tell you about today

211
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,600
is a very active area of research

212
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,760
broadly classed as quantum

213
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
characterization

214
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,160
verification and validation so you may

215
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,320
have also seen this acronym qcvb

216
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,480
and if you've used on some of these open

217
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,360
source packages

218
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
i know um just because it was one of the

219
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,200
first ones i use

220
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,000
um ibm and kiskit quite a bit and they

221
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,440
have an entire module

222
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,800
within kiskit for qcvb and

223
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,360
they use this acronym but it where it

224
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,160
all started

225
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,160
was this problem of tomography

226
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,240
so i'm going to tell you about a small

227
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,360
piece

228
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,160
and and how that connects out to the big

229
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,680
picture

230
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,240
and where where sort of these this

231
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,399
characterization started so

232
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,920
if i am ibm and i want to improve

233
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,320
upon what's happening here i want to

234
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
actually create a device that

235
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,440
when somebody sends me this circuit it

236
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,560
actually happens

237
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,720
as as desired then i need to

238
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,839
characterize all the things that

239
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,040
might go wrong um all the things that

240
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,240
are going wrong

241
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,800
in the device so in

242
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,079
you if you yeah if you're familiar with

243
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,760
quantum circuits

244
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,200
then you'll know that that time

245
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,200
is going from left to right so

246
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,880
at time zero i have i always start in

247
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,519
the

248
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,959
the computational zero state and as i

249
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,560
move right i step through instructions

250
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,000
gates that are applied to the qubits

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,959
so at each point in time the state of

252
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,959
the qubit changes

253
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,680
according to what gates are applied to

254
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,040
it

255
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,880
so at each point in time there's a new

256
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,800
state and

257
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,320
in reality there's a continuously

258
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,839
changing state

259
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,600
and so this is potentially a very

260
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,519
difficult problem

261
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,200
i may have to characterize

262
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,519
some continuous time dynamics of some

263
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,120
physical system

264
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,279
and where do those dynamics come from

265
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,200
they come from the things that i'm

266
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,360
intentionally doing to it and the things

267
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,760
that are unintentionally happening to it

268
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,120
and in principle

269
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,959
there's at least a weak connection

270
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,440
between every particle

271
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,120
that you're interested in and every

272
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,519
other particle in the universe

273
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,279
so that that's potentially a lot of

274
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,760
things that you have to characterize

275
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,839
we're not going to do that we're going

276
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,680
to first start with

277
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,800
the most simplest problem that we can

278
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,079
imagine

279
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,200
in this area which is i

280
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,320
prepare a state say this state r

281
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,279
r y pi over four that i want to tell

282
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,000
teleport

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,360
and i just want to figure out what state

284
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,720
exactly did i prepare so i'm i

285
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,839
i suspect that i've prepared a zero

286
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,399
state and then applied a y rotation

287
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,680
but that might not have actually

288
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,079
happened how do i verify

289
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,920
that that state happened or

290
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,639
a little bit more sophisticated what how

291
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,399
do i figure out what the state

292
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,079
actually is after i apply that gate

293
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,839
all right

294
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,959
okay so the

295
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,399
there's a lot of there's a lot of names

296
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,560
going around here

297
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,880
and the particular problem that we're

298
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,279
going to look at

299
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,650
is quantum

300
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,279
[Music]

301
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,000
state tomography so again this is

302
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,440
asking the question what is

303
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,959
the state of the quantum data at some

304
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:49,760
specific

305
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,600
instant in time so another way to phrase

306
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,639
it is we want to

307
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,399
read some quantum data okay

308
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,040
so let's just uh recall what what this

309
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,160
means so

310
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,680
states you have seen this cat

311
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
with a sigh inside of it i don't want

312
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,160
you to think of that as

313
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,240
something real and physical in the world

314
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,519
this is like

315
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,560
an analogy with

316
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,680
say a bit so if i say i have a bunch of

317
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,079
bits

318
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,120
and this is like bits b sub

319
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,680
three and some bit string it has a

320
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,760
particular value it's either zero or one

321
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,839
that's its state the psi

322
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,639
is in the case of the smallest unit of

323
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,800
quantum information the qubit

324
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,600
a particular two-dimensional vector so

325
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,800
this is

326
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,639
some two-dimensional vector

327
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,079
one way one simple way we'll look at it

328
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,760
later

329
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,480
it's like this

330
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,240
so it has two values

331
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,600
and those are two uh

332
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,800
two two numbers and the state is the

333
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,560
particular two numbers

334
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,279
that are currently specifying this

335
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,040
quantum information so it's a

336
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,920
it's a abstract thing not necessarily a

337
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,839
physical thing

338
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,000
okay so you'll recall that

339
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,199
determining quantum states is

340
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,079
in some sense not so difficult using

341
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,600
linear algebra so

342
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,639
i start my computation in the zero state

343
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,279
and then i apply some gates and i end up

344
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,320
at some

345
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,480
new state and to figure out what that

346
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,440
state is

347
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
i just apply these unitary matrices

348
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,440
these quantum gates to it and i've

349
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,079
determined

350
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
what the state is if you're a physicist

351
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,600
then you just

352
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,279
solve schrodinger's equation and you

353
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,440
find out what the state is

354
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,199
that's the process of deduction and

355
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,600
that's textbook quantum mechanics

356
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,560
in the lab the problem is the opposite

357
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,519
it's the problem of

358
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,880
induction i don't know what the state is

359
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,519
and i can apply things that i know and i

360
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,240
can

361
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,040
measure things

362
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,760
in relation to the state but what i end

363
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,560
up with

364
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,760
remember i showed you i actually ran an

365
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,880
experiment on ibm's quantum device

366
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,399
and what i ended up with was just a

367
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,560
bunch of data

368
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,000
so how do i get from the data

369
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,279
that i observe to the state and this

370
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,759
isn't

371
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,759
a uniquely quantum mechanical problem so

372
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,440
a simple example

373
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,680
might be i have a coin

374
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,320
and you know it's got a heads and

375
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,880
you can help me out here kitty and a

376
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,399
tail that's supposed to be a tail

377
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,160
maybe that's a i was imagining like a

378
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,560
chipmunk tail anyway

379
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,000
um so i have a coin and

380
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,680
maybe uh i want to bet on the outcome of

381
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,120
this coin toss

382
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,279
so do i accept even odds well i don't

383
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,160
know i don't know

384
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
maybe the coin is a trick coin maybe it

385
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,600
has a bias to it maybe it's a very

386
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,680
slight bias so that it's not so obvious

387
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,040
like you know i really uh

388
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,240
simple to detect cheat coin would be one

389
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,519
with two heads

390
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,000
but what if i somehow figured out a way

391
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,839
to slightly bias the coin so that i

392
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,240
could

393
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,639
win just marginally you know be like a

394
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,639
casino

395
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,120
so how do i determine what the bias of

396
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,959
the coin is so i know what odds to

397
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,399
accept in a bet

398
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,720
well i start flipping it and here i've

399
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,560
flipped you know

400
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,360
heads and then tails and then heads and

401
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,920
then

402
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,160
and then tails again and so on and so

403
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,279
forth

404
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,639
and say i flipped it um

405
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,440
say 10 times and out of those 10 times

406
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,120
i saw six

407
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,920
heads and four tails

408
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,600
is it a fair coin well it could be

409
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,959
certainly the most likely outcome

410
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,839
is five heads and five tails but it's

411
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,919
only marginally likely it's

412
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,520
you know six heads and four tails and

413
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,319
four heads and six tails probably

414
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,520
together

415
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,599
those two together are more common than

416
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,880
five and five

417
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,559
so we can't actually

418
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,919
answer this question even if

419
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,880
i flipped it 100 times and just

420
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
miraculously you know or

421
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,080
unmiraculously it came up

422
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,440
60 heads and 40 tails now

423
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,160
i'm a little bit more confident that the

424
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,799
coin

425
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,240
is not fair but um

426
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,480
if you've read about you know if you

427
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,520
read about

428
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,960
um you know science topics in the news

429
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,160
you'll know that

430
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,919
things usually come with these these

431
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,600
p-values

432
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,760
the p-value here is is probably around

433
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,039
two two percent

434
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,559
which means that uh if the coin was

435
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,280
was a fair coin then i would see an

436
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,640
outcome this extreme

437
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,679
two percent of the time but still um you

438
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,600
know if i played this game like a casino

439
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,160
many many

440
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,799
times then two percent of the time even

441
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,400
with a fair coin i would see something

442
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,880
like this

443
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,960
in fact even with a fair coin i might

444
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,640
see 99 heads

445
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,320
and one tail so this problem is

446
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,480
a very old problem and one that still

447
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
argued about today

448
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,919
which is when i see some data how do i

449
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,440
infer what the state

450
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,840
was that generated that data that's the

451
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,440
problem of induction

452
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,400
and it goes back you know you know

453
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,640
thousands of years

454
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,240
um a classic

455
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,200
question that's related to this sort of

456
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,039
binary

457
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,400
hypothesis testing laplace asked

458
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
what is the what is the probability that

459
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,280
the the sun rises again tomorrow

460
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,559
uh can you assign that 100 probability

461
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,600
only because you've seen it happen

462
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,160
i guess i don't know how many days of

463
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,960
life i've been

464
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,000
but i've seen the sunrise every day

465
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,160
so does that mean there's a 100 chance

466
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
that it'll rise again tomorrow

467
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,559
and philosophers still argue about

468
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,840
whether or not

469
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,918
whether or not that's the correct answer

470
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,720
since uh i'm in probably the furthest

471
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,039
eastern time zone i can tell you that

472
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,520
indeed the sun will rise

473
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,799
on the 19th of october

474
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,400
so no need to worry about that so this

475
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,280
this problem is not a quantum mechanical

476
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,520
problem

477
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,559
the the problem of assigning some

478
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,760
description to a probabilistic process

479
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,039
given data is just a generic

480
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,559
problem in statistics it's the

481
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,919
the process of induction so this is why

482
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,320
this is kind of a difficult problem

483
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
because in the opposite problem when you

484
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,799
have

485
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,720
deduction there's a unique answer

486
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,480
there's a correct answer

487
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,440
and in this case there's no correct

488
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,720
answer

489
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,400
and this is why many people argue about

490
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
it but

491
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,480
we're going to assume that uh

492
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,080
you know for free whenever we perform

493
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,799
a measurement we don't have to consider

494
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,559
this particular problem

495
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,000
because there's more there's more

496
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,760
interesting things that come up

497
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,400
in quantum mechanics than just uh you

498
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,159
know the problem that arises that's

499
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,280
equivalent to flipping coins

500
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,440
so when we perform a measurement we're

501
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,400
going to assume

502
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
that the measurement just reveals these

503
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,679
probabilities to us

504
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,480
rather than some finite statistics that

505
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,960
arise

506
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,360
uh and let me let

507
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,280
in moving forward for the time being

508
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,720
we're going to assume that

509
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,600
that there's no phase here okay so the

510
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,120
state is just this

511
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,159
cosine theta over two sine theta over

512
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:12,880
two

513
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,440
and the reason that i want to do that is

514
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,880
so that i can

515
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,840
draw the state space as a circle

516
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,000
okay so i have my quantum state

517
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,799
it's

518
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,400
particular location is given by

519
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,400
by theta there's the zero state up there

520
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,520
there's the one state down there

521
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,640
if you recall the plus state

522
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,919
which is a superposition of zero

523
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,480
and one and then the minus state

524
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,159
which is a

525
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,000
another superposition of 0 1 with a

526
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,320
minus sign there

527
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,280
and the state is the quantum state is

528
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,760
just

529
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,760
some particular location on this circle

530
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,919
so if you're familiar with what's known

531
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,600
as the block sphere

532
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,760
then basically we've cut the bloch

533
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,559
sphere kind of

534
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,120
down the center of the x-axis so there's

535
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,679
no

536
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,840
there's no sorry y-axis so there's no

537
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,960
y-value

538
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,080
all i have is a is a z

539
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,000
so this is just if you're familiar with

540
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,640
the block sphere all i have is a z

541
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,240
and an x axis here and the reason for

542
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,360
this is

543
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,520
is just so that we can draw pictures in

544
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,320
in two dimensions and think about things

545
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,840
a little in a little bit more simpler

546
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,919
terms

547
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,000
so when i perform that

548
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,280
experiment on my ibm

549
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,640
device remember that

550
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,400
here what's happening is i'm measuring

551
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,520
these qubits in the computational basis

552
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
so each qubit is measured

553
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,720
and either a zero state or a one state

554
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,200
occurs

555
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,840
and so when i measure i'm going to get

556
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,559
only either this state or this state

557
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,880
so i have some state let's suppose it's

558
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,960
the state that i've drawn here

559
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,080
right so here's the state

560
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,919
um remember we don't know what the state

561
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,440
is i've

562
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
you know set things up in my quantum

563
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,039
computer i expect

564
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,280
to be preparing this state here

565
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,960
again there's a physical device

566
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,880
and i want to encode some quantum

567
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,320
information and this is the quantum

568
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,919
information that i want to encode on

569
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:48,960
that device

570
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,799
and now i want to go and i want to read

571
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,600
that quantum information

572
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,440
and again we're going to assume that

573
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,679
when i perform the measurement

574
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,520
you know you recall that it sort of it

575
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,039
collapses to 0

576
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,080
or 1 and that probability in this

577
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,720
picture

578
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,440
is related to how close the state is to

579
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,520
either zero or one

580
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,440
um but we're going to

581
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,320
assume that we get that number uh or

582
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,080
another way to say it is

583
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,360
uh i've i can do an infinite number of

584
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,600
measurements let's just assume that

585
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,640
um and how how do i do that well

586
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,120
i just in in practice i just prepare the

587
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,799
system again and again and again so

588
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,000
that's what happens in the

589
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,840
in the actual experiment those 1024

590
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,640
shots they were called are just the

591
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,279
experiment

592
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,760
resetting itself and starting over again

593
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,120
and performing measurements so every

594
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,720
time i run an experiment

595
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,760
i get a zero or one and then i kind of

596
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,120
collate all of this

597
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,840
all of this data okay so here i have

598
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,559
done an experiment and

599
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,000
i have my one state in my zero state

600
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,080
and here's my the state i

601
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,159
uh here's the state that was actually

602
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,520
prepared which again

603
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,120
i don't i don't actually know that that

604
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,159
was the state that was prepared

605
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,360
and what happens is so let's

606
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,880
well let's say so the state is psi

607
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,279
and it's cosine theta over 2

608
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,840
0

609
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,799
let me make that a little bit bigger and

610
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:43,840
more clearly for you

611
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,240
and the rule in quantum mechanics is

612
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,360
that i will see

613
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,200
this outcome here with

614
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,039
probability equal to the square of that

615
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,440
coefficient in front of the zero state

616
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,880
so i need to

617
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,159
square this so i have cosine

618
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,919
squared theta over two

619
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,559
that's the probability with which i see

620
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,960
the zero state and if i performed

621
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,919
this measurement a computational basis

622
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:16,640
measurement

623
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,760
an infinite number of times then

624
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,400
the fraction of times i see the zero

625
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,600
outcome will be

626
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,080
this number whatever theta is it'll be

627
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,279
that particular

628
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,480
number cosine squared theta over 2.

629
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,520
but because of the square now

630
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,960
i have two different values of data

631
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,520
that are consistent with whatever number

632
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,039
that ends up being

633
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,520
so when i perform a measurement i kind

634
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,880
of get the distance

635
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,600
to that particular state so if i perform

636
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,559
a measurement

637
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,000
of 0 and 1 then i get a number that

638
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
tells me the distance

639
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,559
to the zero state or equivalently the

640
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,720
distance to the one state

641
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,120
so in this case i don't know whether

642
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,000
it's

643
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,720
theta or minus theta because those give

644
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,240
the same value

645
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,200
of cosine squared theta over 2.

646
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,640
okay so it seems like i can't actually

647
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,320
solve this problem i want to read the

648
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,080
quantum information but i can't actually

649
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,960
do it

650
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,440
because i can't distinguish between

651
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,240
these two states

652
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
well

653
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,600
this isn't the only measurement i can do

654
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,480
i can perform a measurement in any

655
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,880
basis and that means i can distinguish

656
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,200
in quantum mechanics between any two

657
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
orthogonal states and

658
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,120
if i'm going to do another one then by

659
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,200
symmetry maybe it makes sense to do kind

660
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,840
of

661
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,200
uh this plus minus state also it's the

662
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,080
only states

663
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,039
that are really have their own names so

664
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,360
let's use that basis

665
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,880
okay so now i'm going to perform

666
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,080
uh a measure another measurement on

667
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,360
another infinite set

668
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,640
of copies of this of this state remember

669
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,880
it's this state here

670
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,120
and at this point i know that it's

671
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,760
either this one or this one

672
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,480
and now when i perform a measurement in

673
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,520
this basis

674
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,399
i'm i'm going to get the plus state or

675
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,159
the minus state

676
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,480
and i can calculate what those

677
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,919
probabilities are

678
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,520
because i know what the state is so i

679
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,039
can i could rewrite this state up here

680
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,039
uh in the plus and minus basis

681
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,000
if i wanted to but like geometrically i

682
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,080
know that i'm going to get the distance

683
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,000
to the plus state from this from this

684
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,600
measurement

685
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,440
and what will happen is

686
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,240
i'll know that it's either that state or

687
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,039
a state that's

688
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,039
the same distance away from the plus

689
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,240
state which is

690
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,520
the one opposite um

691
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,640
kind of uh uh

692
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,679
transpose or or reflected in the x-axis

693
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,039
here

694
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,480
so the zero basis the computational

695
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,679
basis tells me

696
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,159
the distance to the zero state up here

697
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,480
or how far away it is from the one state

698
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,720
and when i perform a measurement in the

699
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,520
plus minus basis then i can tell the

700
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,120
distance to that state and

701
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,279
now you can see that with these two

702
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,480
numbers

703
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,120
i can uniquely identify the state

704
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,559
as this one here so i needed to perform

705
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,760
two different types

706
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,799
of measurements because of this collapse

707
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,279
rule

708
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,320
in quantum mechanics

709
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,440
okay maybe that's a good place to pause

710
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,720
and let anyone ask any questions

711
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,919
um kitty how do we how do we want to

712
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,520
manage that do people just unmute

713
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,120
themselves and that's fine

714
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,080
with me yeah we can have people are mute

715
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,399
or

716
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,520
type questions in the chat

717
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,480
so i will remind people that this is

718
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,039
very

719
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,320
similar logic as the as

720
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,919
uh chsh game so if you've taken that

721
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,360
class if you haven't

722
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,760
seen that you can look at the past

723
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,919
classes and find the

724
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,520
chsh game that's

725
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,200
using similar ideas here

726
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,720
is there any questions from the audience

727
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,919
here yet

728
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,039
i actually have one as we wait

729
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,240
um so i'm

730
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,880
wondering how are we going to

731
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,000
practically use

732
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,679
this method in actual

733
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,919
quantum circuits for example

734
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,039
if we want to know the state at each

735
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:01,679
point

736
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,799
of our operation can we really do

737
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,120
measurement there because then we'll

738
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,080
just

739
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,399
um i hate to use the word collapse but

740
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,519
it is

741
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,919
forcing a state to come out after the

742
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:14,720
measurement

743
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,240
how do we get back to it yeah

744
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,679
so um so there's a

745
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,480
there's a couple issues so in this

746
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,919
circuit that i'm showing you

747
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,320
there's a state at the at the end of the

748
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,960
circuit

749
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,559
so that might be a state that i'm

750
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,559
interested in

751
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,399
and what i would need to do

752
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,679
is perform many i'd have to repeat this

753
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:40,320
circuit

754
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,640
with different kinds of measurements to

755
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,440
get the state

756
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,799
at that point and then

757
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,240
and then i could move backwards i could

758
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,799
remove this

759
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,320
and then do the same thing and then i

760
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,240
would find the state

761
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,440
at one step prior and then

762
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,399
i could remove this and i would find the

763
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,679
state

764
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,519
after performing the same kinds of

765
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,039
measurements i would perform

766
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,440
i would find what the state is at that

767
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,399
point

768
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,440
um and ideally

769
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,919
what i would find is like these these

770
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,760
these numbers the actual

771
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,480
state vector um and

772
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,960
and then i i kind of have to make some

773
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,240
assumptions

774
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,360
there i have to assume that

775
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,720
the circuit that i'm showing you here

776
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,919
is the same

777
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,960
circuit uh

778
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,519
the same it does the exact same thing up

779
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,200
to that point

780
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,720
for this new circuit that has an

781
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,440
additional gate added to it

782
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,039
so there are there are a lot of

783
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,200
assumptions that you have to make

784
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,080
right so i have to assume that um where

785
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,000
this dotted line is

786
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,320
that i've prepared the state that was

787
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,840
just shown

788
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,840
um and so that when i add this new gate

789
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,880
i'm i'm only modifying that previous

790
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,000
that previous state so it is

791
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,919
it is a difficult and challenging and

792
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,039
challenging problem

793
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,960
i'll talk a little bit a little bit more

794
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,200
about um the diffic the various levels

795
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,399
of difficulty

796
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,080
uh um at the end of at the end of the

797
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,570
lecture

798
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,640
[Music]

799
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,880
there are two questions in the chat i

800
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,240
think the first ones

801
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,880
uh kind of you've already answered it so

802
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,360
john

803
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,640
asks how do you measure the state twice

804
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,559
if the state collapses after the first

805
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,399
measurement

806
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,519
right so you have to um

807
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,960
i yeah i like this this diagram here um

808
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,799
so let's go here so when i ran

809
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,240
my quantum algorithm on the ibm quantum

810
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,760
computer what happened was

811
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,840
that whole thing was repeated 1024 times

812
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,240
so

813
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,559
the state collapsed 1024 times

814
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,279
it was the whole thing was re-prepared

815
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,120
starting in the zero state

816
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,200
all of those gates were applied again

817
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,800
and the state collapsed again

818
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,679
so the first thing that should come to

819
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,800
your mind is

820
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,480
i thought there was like no cloning how

821
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,800
do i make copies of the state i'm

822
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,320
interested in

823
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,639
the data that i'm interested in reading

824
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,760
well

825
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,040
um you can copy quantum information in a

826
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,040
in a particular basis and really um

827
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,199
another way to think about the state is

828
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,280
just a description of

829
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,320
the preparation procedure so in this

830
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,199
case

831
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,040
the preparation procedure is this

832
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,399
procedure here

833
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,839
and so i can copy the

834
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,599
the quantum data whatever quantum data

835
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,359
is output at the circuit

836
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,199
simply by starting in the zero state and

837
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,359
just applying the same gates so

838
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,480
um if you can imagine that there's a

839
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,119
hundred

840
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,400
there's 1024 uh

841
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,920
different devices and i apply the same

842
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,800
thing

843
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,000
to all of these devices so i i

844
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,800
apply this circuit to each of the 1024

845
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,760
devices

846
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,000
and so each of those devices should be

847
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,280
described

848
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,480
by the same state so

849
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,440
now i have 1024 states and i can do

850
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,400
these different

851
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,520
these different measurements these

852
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,640
multiple measurements in in your

853
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,079
your question these two different kinds

854
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,320
of measurements by just taking the first

855
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,359
half

856
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,640
and measuring in the zero one basis

857
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,720
and taking the second half and measuring

858
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,760
in the plus minus basis

859
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,119
great and the question from pk

860
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,920
usually in some of the tutorials i have

861
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,160
seen 0 and 1 states

862
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,520
are shown in orthogonal vectors but you

863
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,400
are showing them

864
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,440
opposite side of a circle oh yeah you

865
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:55,920
also

866
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,640
explain it is basically projecting the

867
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,400
block sphere into the two

868
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,000
to the circle yeah yeah that's one of

869
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,680
the things that

870
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,839
that i've always i've always thought was

871
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,640
unfortunate about the block sphere

872
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,480
especially when you're introducing it is

873
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,839
that

874
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,119
orthogonal states are not orthogonal

875
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,240
um they're antipodal states and that

876
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,400
i think if you think about it long

877
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,599
enough

878
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,040
you'll see that it comes from this

879
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,000
definition right here

880
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,119
so when the bloch sphere is defined it's

881
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,560
defined with this

882
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,680
half and the reason is quite um

883
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,079
it's quite simple it's because if i

884
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,680
didn't have the half there then you're

885
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,400
right

886
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,480
the one state would be over here

887
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,160
but then the zero state would be at the

888
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,760
bottom again and i would

889
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,800
i would kind of um

890
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,560
i would uh cover the sphere twice

891
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,680
um or in this case the circle uh

892
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,599
so in order to just in order to cover

893
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,440
the sphere only once

894
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,960
then i divide theta by two

895
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,480
so that um they it doesn't become

896
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,520
orthogonal

897
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,920
in euclidean space but they're still

898
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,520
orthogonal in this

899
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,040
um complex two-dimensional space

900
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,599
there's actually really interesting

901
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,400
geometry

902
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,040
there but basically it comes down to

903
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,960
this definition of

904
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,000
theta over two so that the

905
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,920
the circle or in the case of the bloch

906
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,400
sphere we're only covering it

907
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,640
once rather than twice

908
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,320
there are two more questions do you want

909
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,400
to take them now or wait two later

910
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,040
sure yeah we can take them now okay so

911
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,599
daniel

912
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,040
asks uh is it correct to say that you

913
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,960
can clone a known state

914
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,320
but not an unknown one

915
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,040
yeah that's right so if i if i know the

916
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,359
state so you can clone

917
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,160
you can clone classical information

918
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,599
classical information

919
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,640
is any basis so

920
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,839
a basis the most obvious one would be

921
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,920
um so let's just go over here the most

922
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,359
obvious one would be the computational

923
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,720
basis so

924
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,280
if i have many in this case if i if i

925
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,200
have three qubits then

926
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,440
i have these eight different states

927
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,480
yada yada all the way down to one

928
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,680
uh and the labels of those states

929
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,880
are just three classical bits and so

930
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,200
of course i can copy those right because

931
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,280
i know i can copy classical information

932
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,880
so i can copy a single basis

933
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,480
um and if i know what the state is

934
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,200
then it is an element of many different

935
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,640
bases so

936
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,800
you're right if i know what the state is

937
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,880
then i can copy it

938
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,400
if i don't know what the state is so if

939
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,000
it's a if it's the superposition of

940
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,720
these

941
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,079
then there's no fixed gate that allows

942
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,599
me to copy that

943
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,599
independent of what particular

944
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,520
superposition it is

945
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,359
but if i know that superposition then i

946
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,560
can design the gate to copy it

947
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,040
we also shown the proof of the

948
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
non-cloning theorem in one of the

949
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,000
previous classes

950
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,520
you can look back to howard asks

951
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,320
this problem space is two-dimensional is

952
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,440
this

953
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,520
solution also good for more dimensions

954
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
ah that's a perfect segue to the next

955
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,160
thing i want to talk about

956
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,280
how how long do i have kitty so i see 50

957
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,560
minutes

958
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,560
let's have another 10 minutes perfect

959
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,079
okay that's perfect so the block sphere

960
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:42,960
remember has

961
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,079
a sort of a a y-axis coming out

962
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,599
so there's a y-axis here coming out

963
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,200
it's a bit too thick as a y-axis coming

964
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,839
out

965
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,880
out of my screen and

966
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,359
the story there is the same so if i

967
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,240
perform a

968
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,440
measurement in this new direction then i

969
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,880
get the distance to that

970
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,040
sometimes it's called the plus y state

971
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,720
uh or plus i state

972
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,240
um and there would be two states

973
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,280
that are consistent with that well if we

974
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,599
if we add another another dimension and

975
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,200
in fact for each of these measurements

976
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,800
there would be four states

977
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,599
um that are consistent with each of

978
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,200
those measurements

979
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,920
so um if i it's hard to draw in three

980
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,520
dimensions that's why i didn't do it

981
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,760
so if i perform a y measurement then

982
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,839
there'll be four

983
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,760
you know uh at some point i would be

984
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,040
um distinguishing between um

985
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,160
four states actually you know to be

986
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,319
let's let me just draw a quick picture

987
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,240
here see if i can do it for just one

988
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
measurement

989
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,920
so if i have zero and one

990
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,599
and it's three dimensional now

991
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,400
and i say what's the i get i perform a

992
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,480
measurement and i know the distance

993
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,880
that the state is to the zero state you

994
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,480
know that's going to give me a

995
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,000
a band right a band of states

996
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,640
that are around zero and if i

997
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,440
then do x then it's going to give me a

998
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,880
band of states

999
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,640
and then those that those two things are

1000
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,119
going to cross at two points

1001
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,880
one here and one on the opposite side of

1002
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,160
the sphere

1003
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,200
and you then you can imagine that um

1004
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,040
that if i did the y measurements i'm

1005
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,480
going to get

1006
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,839
a circle that's um around

1007
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,200
the w the y axis and where all

1008
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,560
three of those rings coincide that's the

1009
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,040
state

1010
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,280
so i'm um it's kind of like a like

1011
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,240
triangulation

1012
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,319
sort of a triangulation procedure um

1013
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,560
and remember that if i have more so

1014
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,960
now i have a a qubit it has

1015
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,480
two dimensions which if i can

1016
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,280
plot it on the bloch sphere are the

1017
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,800
block sphere is in three dimensions but

1018
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,680
there's two

1019
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,280
only two numbers these two block angles

1020
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,240
but i need three measurements to read

1021
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,920
three different kinds of measurements to

1022
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,079
read the quantum data

1023
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,640
in general if i have n qubits

1024
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,760
then the dimension d so the number of

1025
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,160
complex numbers i need to specify it is

1026
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,680
2 to the n and in fact

1027
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,799
to read that data

1028
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,560
i need something like um

1029
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,800
not not exactly but something like two

1030
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,240
times d

1031
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,880
different measurements and so that's

1032
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,000
exponentially

1033
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,599
many different kinds of measurements for

1034
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,280
n qubits and at this point you might be

1035
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,119
wondering what is the point of any of

1036
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,280
this quantum information stuff at all

1037
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,319
if uh if i can't even read

1038
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,000
quantum data how you know

1039
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,280
what is the point of encoding

1040
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,839
information in quantum data by the way

1041
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,960
um the fact that a

1042
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,839
a single measurement so one let's say

1043
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,078
one

1044
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,839
measurement

1045
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,720
uh or one type of measurement or another

1046
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,839
way to say it is

1047
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,560
um yeah let's do it this way so we have

1048
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,000
n qubits

1049
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,319
can

1050
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,839
convey only n bits

1051
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,119
of information

1052
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,760
and this all comes down to basically

1053
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,640
this collapse

1054
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,920
rule that when i have a qubit

1055
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,160
and i perform a measurement the result

1056
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,640
of that measurement is a single bit

1057
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,200
so if i have n qubits and i measure each

1058
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,160
of them

1059
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,480
then i get n bits of information

1060
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,160
and so it doesn't look like i'm able to

1061
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,240
kind of explore this exponential space

1062
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,839
or you know since this

1063
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,800
qubit is a sphere i i might imagine that

1064
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,760
i could

1065
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,920
could encode a real number which has a

1066
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,119
continuously

1067
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,560
infinite state space however

1068
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,079
and this is actually a very interesting

1069
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,079
and deep question and

1070
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,640
what what the answer kind of shows us

1071
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,200
that

1072
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,960
quantum physics like the

1073
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,160
the rules that govern nature sit right

1074
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,200
on the fence of like way too powerful

1075
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,240
and utterly useless so

1076
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,079
if we could actually encode and read

1077
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,640
real numbers from qubits then you can

1078
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,200
show from a computational standpoint

1079
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,640
that that quantum quantum

1080
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,040
computing would be way too powerful it

1081
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,960
would kind of upend everything we know

1082
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,599
about

1083
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,960
about computation and from a physical

1084
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,839
standpoint

1085
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,440
we would expect to see that that effect

1086
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,480
in nature

1087
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,200
so you have that kind of these

1088
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,160
restrictions

1089
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,359
on quantum data and those

1090
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,640
restrictions um are actually in some

1091
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,000
sense necessary

1092
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,079
so that we don't live in a kind of

1093
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,359
trivial world

1094
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,720
if if if we if we were able to access

1095
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,280
kind of

1096
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,920
what we might naively hope or expect

1097
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,440
with quantum data

1098
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,280
then trivialize kind of all of our

1099
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,839
understandings of computation and

1100
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,359
mathematics

1101
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,720
so that also means that our task

1102
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,720
in designing algorithms and coming up

1103
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,960
with clever ways in which

1104
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,480
these algorithms work so that

1105
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,680
the quantum data that we can read is

1106
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,280
that is accessible is a challenging

1107
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,160
problem and

1108
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,319
um you know for for scientists and

1109
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,079
engineers problems are

1110
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,280
are the reason that that we're here and

1111
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,800
um kind of a we could go off on a

1112
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,319
meaning of life

1113
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,599
uh tangent but we won't okay so

1114
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,920
back to to to kitty's original question

1115
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,640
i want to draw kind of an axis here

1116
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,319
and this axis is

1117
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,520
on this end is is hard problems

1118
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,960
uh like difficult to solve

1119
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,000
tasks and over here is

1120
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,560
easy and also

1121
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,720
at the same time this tells us like how

1122
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,760
many

1123
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,359
how many parameters so over here is

1124
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,560
more parameters and over here is less

1125
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,119
parameters

1126
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,720
okay so on this side

1127
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,240
let's say in the middle like right

1128
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,920
around here

1129
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,400
is what we've been talking about state

1130
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,359
tomography

1131
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,160
and i need um

1132
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,160
to like two to the n um parameters

1133
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,440
where n is the number of qubits if i

1134
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,640
wanted to

1135
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,040
understand also like the dynamics

1136
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,200
so this is called process tomography so

1137
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,160
if i wanted to

1138
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,720
not figure out what the state is but

1139
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,160
figure out one of the what one of those

1140
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:53,839
gates are

1141
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,319
so if i have a unitary and i want to

1142
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,480
know what the unitary is then i need

1143
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,520
uh then it's not n vector it's a

1144
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,480
2 to the n by 2 to the n matrix so i i

1145
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,119
need

1146
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,839
2 to the 2n

1147
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,880
and i might want to

1148
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,720
know an entire gate set

1149
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,559
um and if i have um let's say

1150
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,680
m gates then this is m

1151
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,040
times to the n right

1152
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,040
and you know if i wanted to understand

1153
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,839
kind of everything

1154
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,880
that's very hard and we require like

1155
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,319
infinitely many parameters

1156
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,440
okay so uh

1157
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,240
i think everything to the left of state

1158
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,079
tomography here

1159
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,520
is um is

1160
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,720
it is necessary to

1161
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,559
start to try to build these prototype

1162
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,640
devices the kinds that i ran

1163
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,920
my algorithm on at ibm but you can see

1164
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,720
that because

1165
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,839
things grow exponentially at some point

1166
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,319
we just can't do this so if we have a

1167
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,599
device that can

1168
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,800
sell you know run shore's algorithm

1169
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,800
or even just a device that has a hundred

1170
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,920
qubits

1171
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,720
you can see that uh you know two to the

1172
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,920
200

1173
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,040
is not going to allow me to

1174
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,800
uh actually characterize um

1175
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,599
the the gates that are being applied to

1176
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:32,559
this

1177
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,160
so we need to go to the right hand side

1178
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,720
i'll i will say that that this has

1179
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,240
a name this is kind of the

1180
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,520
characterization part

1181
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,200
so we're trying to get a complete

1182
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,880
description of what

1183
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,400
of what's happening or part of what's

1184
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,920
happening

1185
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,200
okay so let's now zoom in

1186
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,839
let's zoom in here

1187
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,160
and we can we can start to uh

1188
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,880
make assumptions okay so the things on

1189
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,520
the left

1190
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,079
still requires some assumptions but over

1191
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,280
here we're talking about more

1192
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,119
assumptions so we might say

1193
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,830
that

1194
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:17,920
[Music]

1195
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,240
that

1196
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,000
we have some special class of states

1197
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,359
i was trying to think for a moment if

1198
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,040
you've if you may have heard any in the

1199
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,559
previous

1200
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,119
lectures

1201
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,559
and the idea would be you want to find a

1202
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:39,760
subspace

1203
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,440
of the full space that is not

1204
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,960
exponential in size

1205
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,440
so you're looking for something that is

1206
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,319
like

1207
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,440
order n the number of qubits and if i

1208
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,800
can distinguish between those

1209
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,119
then i can do this do this thing

1210
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,119
efficiently

1211
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,720
and there's various kind of special

1212
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,119
classes of states

1213
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,480
and that

1214
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,160
that area is you can think of as

1215
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,240
what the verification part

1216
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,079
verification

1217
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,520
and then there's a whole

1218
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,319
uh there's a whole class of

1219
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,280
of different types of protocols that

1220
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,079
allow you to go all the way down to one

1221
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,280
this has the name randomized

1222
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,160
benchmarking which is a very popular

1223
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,960
random demise let's do it the english

1224
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,200
way

1225
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,839
yes

1226
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,599
which tells us one parameter and this

1227
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:56,720
one parameter

1228
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,640
is actually the parameter that you'll

1229
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,800
see

1230
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,319
that you'll see here

1231
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:08,400
so if i so this is the device that i ran

1232
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,520
my algorithm on

1233
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,720
the ibmq pagoda

1234
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,800
device and here is the result of

1235
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
the well not not the full result but

1236
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,119
what what their summary of the result of

1237
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,839
their

1238
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,880
characterization routine is so

1239
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,440
when you look at the quantum devices

1240
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,880
that you're allowed to run on you see

1241
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,760
them all here on the right hand side

1242
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,559
they're all uh they're all in fact

1243
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,839
online i was hoping that

1244
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,640
one of them wouldn't be online um so

1245
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,280
sometimes

1246
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,839
they don't show that they're online and

1247
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:42,640
that's because

1248
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,440
the devices kind of shift and change you

1249
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,040
know these are

1250
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,040
experiments that are being run and the

1251
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,160
the kind of uh calibration

1252
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,720
becomes misaligned so sometimes they go

1253
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,599
offline

1254
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:02,400
and they have to uh be calibrated

1255
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,839
and during this this calibration time

1256
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,920
they're performing exactly this quantum

1257
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,960
state tomography

1258
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,440
and a bunch of other protocols one of

1259
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,400
which is this

1260
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,400
this randomized benchmarking protocol

1261
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,240
which tells me the one number

1262
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,880
and this is the one number that you see

1263
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,160
listed here

1264
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,000
as error rates so it says qubit 0

1265
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,520
has an error rate of 5

1266
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,440
times ten to the minus four which is

1267
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,960
very um this is a

1268
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,000
one other better devices um

1269
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,079
so that's very low uh some of the qubits

1270
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,040
are are

1271
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,520
so the qubit two and three are half you

1272
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,359
know half as good in some sense because

1273
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,240
they have

1274
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,520
double the error rate as the

1275
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,520
zero and one and that also shows um

1276
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,079
the the error when i'm trying to perform

1277
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,240
these gates that make these qubits

1278
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,440
communicate so that's

1279
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,960
typically a higher error rate and you

1280
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,200
see that um

1281
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,319
that we have 10 to the minus 3 or

1282
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,680
roughly 10 to the minus 2

1283
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,440
actually for the gates that happen

1284
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,160
between the cupids

1285
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,599
so that's uh that's at the

1286
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,880
the extreme end of characterization

1287
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,200
where i'm getting a few numbers and i'm

1288
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,880
not actually

1289
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,440
figuring out what the particular state

1290
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,960
of the device is

1291
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,520
i don't i'm not being i'm not reading

1292
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,119
the quantum data

1293
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,200
but i'm getting some information about

1294
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,480
it

1295
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,240
but it's not complete information that's

1296
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:38,799
at this

1297
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:42,160
extreme end and um and this is

1298
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,559
the the validation part of the

1299
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,160
qcvb validation

1300
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,040
so i have quantum characterization

1301
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,000
verification

1302
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,839
and validation um

1303
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:01,599
and so this um

1304
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,839
you know the kind of filling in this

1305
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,640
spectrum of

1306
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,200
uh hard and easy and figuring out all

1307
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,799
the details about each of these

1308
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,240
protocols

1309
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,000
is a is an extremely active area of

1310
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,839
research because again

1311
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,359
we don't have a a device

1312
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,880
that is is good enough to perform the

1313
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,640
algorithms that we want to run on it to

1314
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,520
perform the gates

1315
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,680
we want to run on it so we need to

1316
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,640
figure out

1317
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,960
what's actually happening so that we can

1318
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,960
improve in some sort of engineering

1319
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,839
cycle

1320
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,119
and then i'll just mention um the thing

1321
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:39,760
that i

1322
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,079
that i said that we forget about was the

1323
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,960
fact that

1324
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,839
in each of these whenever you run these

1325
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:46,799
protocols

1326
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,240
you're performing quantum measurements

1327
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,319
and those are probabilistic

1328
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,799
and so i've assumed when i've when i've

1329
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,160
said these are the number

1330
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,680
like the number of parameters that you

1331
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,400
need or this is how difficult it is

1332
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,799
again that's assuming that i get this

1333
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,119
sort of infinite number of copies

1334
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,640
in the case of finite number of copies

1335
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,040
we're back to the statistical problem

1336
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,960
and it's not just a simple statistical

1337
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,799
problem like coin flipping

1338
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,000
it's actually a new kind of

1339
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,480
probabilistic model so you can think of

1340
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,640
quantum mechanics as a new kind of

1341
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,920
probability

1342
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,359
and uh i looked this up um

1343
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,359
just to give you a sense uh because i

1344
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:26,880
didn't understand this one

1345
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,960
until um until grad school that

1346
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,680
academic statistics is a huge field so

1347
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,240
the institute of mathematical statistics

1348
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,680
this is kind of an international

1349
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,599
governing body of statisticians

1350
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,839
has 4 000 members and there's probably

1351
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,359
hundreds of academic journals about

1352
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:44,559
statistics

1353
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,240
and it's mathematics it's it's people

1354
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,839
doing things that

1355
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,440
aren't necessarily thinking about

1356
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,880
applications

1357
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,160
and what i did in in a lot of my

1358
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,400
research in the in the past was

1359
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,960
in this mathematics and thinking about

1360
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,000
these

1361
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,440
new statistical models and

1362
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,040
just trying to solve interesting

1363
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,520
mathematical puzzles related to them

1364
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,720
so this small problem of let's read

1365
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,400
quantum data

1366
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,880
has spawned you know an enormous new

1367
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,079
field

1368
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,720
of science which has applications in

1369
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,720
building quantum computers but also just

1370
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,280
in kind of recreational mathematics and

1371
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,160
thinking about

1372
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,359
probability and statistics and uh

1373
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,599
if you if you're brave enough you can

1374
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:32,400
even find

1375
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,720
people talking about this problem in the

1376
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,480
in the philosophy of science

1377
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,280
so that's all i wanted that's all that i

1378
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,880
kind of wanted to get across

1379
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,799
in in this lecture and if you have any

1380
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,240
questions about these topics i'm happy

1381
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,879
to answer them

1382
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,119
thank you so much chris it's already

1383
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:51,760
been an

1384
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,720
hour so if anyone has questions make it

1385
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,959
quick

1386
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,599
yeah it's a really great lecture thank

1387
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:00,720
you chris

1388
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,480
oh thank you um i have

1389
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,799
a quick question i hope so the qcvb

1390
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,319
is it only applicable for nisk

1391
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,520
type of quantum hardware or

1392
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,440
is its universal

1393
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,119
so the i

1394
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,520
my suspicion well we don't know i mean

1395
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,359
my suspicion is that

1396
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:31,839
uh at some point uh when

1397
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,119
when there's a when there's a job

1398
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,280
application available for

1399
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,400
quantum software engineer

1400
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,440
at that point in time the the term

1401
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,839
tomography will be long forgotten

1402
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,280
because if you have a large-scale

1403
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,839
quantum

1404
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:52,000
device then the reality is

1405
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,960
you we just can't know we can't open the

1406
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,440
box

1407
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,440
we can't know what's happening inside

1408
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,640
there's just too many

1409
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,240
numbers um so if there's a thousand

1410
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,200
qubits you know two to three thousand is

1411
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:05,839
is just

1412
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:07,760
you know i guess probably more than the

1413
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,319
number of of atoms in the universe right

1414
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:10,880
so

1415
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,160
there's there's too many parameters

1416
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,839
needed to specify the state

1417
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,680
and so this problem is is not one we'll

1418
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,760
eventually we'll even think about and

1419
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,359
and that that kind of

1420
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,079
poses an interesting challenge um one

1421
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,000
that i don't think

1422
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,200
um we've really kind of faced in in

1423
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,280
engineering before which is

1424
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,200
how do you build something that you

1425
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,880
don't even you can't even

1426
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,520
see what it is in principle you can't

1427
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,040
know what it what it is you're building

1428
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,359
so

1429
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,400
how do you how do you build it um so

1430
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,480
i think quantum computing quantum

1431
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,520
technology

1432
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,079
uh is is like a paradigm shift in the

1433
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,359
way we think about

1434
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,720
science and engineering um but

1435
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,520
you know we'll i'm sure we'll find we'll

1436
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,720
find a way to get there

1437
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,480
now there's one there's one i think

1438
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,000
there's one area

1439
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,480
that that i've some research that i've

1440
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,760
been involved in

1441
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,839
and with some of my colleagues at

1442
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,200
microsoft

1443
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,480
in this idea of bootstrapping so

1444
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,240
this happens of course in classical

1445
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,920
computation where

1446
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,000
the next generation of computer chips is

1447
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,520
designed by the current generation of

1448
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,040
computer chips and

1449
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,720
actually yeah there's no human that

1450
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,480
really understands all the connections

1451
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,599
that are happening

1452
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,960
inside of today's microprocessors

1453
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,160
so uh why not apply the same idea

1454
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,640
in in building quantum computers so we

1455
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,520
build

1456
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,640
like ibm's devices we have a

1457
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,640
great five qubit device let's use that

1458
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,119
to help us simulate and design

1459
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,480
the next device so this this is called

1460
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,960
quantum bootstrapping and we have some

1461
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,079
kind of theoretical

1462
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,960
ideas for for how we might we might make

1463
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,280
it work

1464
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,000
so it's it's the same problem that i

1465
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,200
just discussed

1466
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,640
but trying to utilize um utilize

1467
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,000
quantum resources to solve it rather

1468
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,200
than

1469
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,440
thinking about coming up with

1470
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,640
descriptions that

1471
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,880
you know we can represent with classical

1472
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,160
data right

1473
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,520
yeah that's great

1474
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,319
i think we should just pause there and i

1475
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:26,720
think

1476
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,760
it will also uh make a very good

1477
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,000
connection to the next class by michael

1478
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,119
viverland on

1479
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,160
uh quantum error correction so that's

1480
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,200
also really complicated area

1481
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,160
how do we make sure the yeah how do we

1482
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,240
correct the errors that's

1483
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,280
from the probabilistic outcomes

1484
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,400
so thank you and thanks everyone for

1485
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,839
joining us today
