2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,679
hi everybody welcome back to the fbi

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,200
drone racing course on hacker to you my

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,639
name is ayan and i'm your course

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,280
instructor

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,200
this is the class 3 of this course and

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,720
today we are discussing about uh

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,680
batteries

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,320
uh esc's and motors and we already had

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,600
class one and two where we discussed

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,000
about

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,080
drone physics involved in flying

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,840
everything in between and

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,160
propellers and frame selections uh this

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,519
is going to be very crucial class

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,720
because we are talking about the

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,238
powerhouse of the drone and we will be

18
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,440
discussing about

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,680
motors uh electronic speed controllers

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,360
and batteries and so

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,120
that's a lot of thing to cover today so

22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,559
let's just dive right into the class

23
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,320
all right so this is the class agenda

24
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,840
today we will be talking about uh

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,640
brushless dc motors the one which we use

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,640
in in our in our drones in our

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,879
quadcopters multirotors and any kind of

28
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,039
uavs these are the most commonly used

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,520
motors we'll discuss about their parts

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,280
and we'll discuss about

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,120
magnetism we'll discuss about electric

32
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,399
field and motion

33
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,559
and things like that which you might

34
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,400
have already started in your high school

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,119
or something but

36
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,560
we're gonna have a recap there because

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,960
that's important to understand

38
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,640
then we'll be talking about different

39
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,640
ratings that a brushless motor have and

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,400
this is basically will help you choose

41
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
a brushless motor for your drone project

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,720
because when you are going into the

43
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,320
market you have lot of different

44
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,200
options available uh to suit the to suit

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,960
your particular need and you need to

46
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,680
know about these

47
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
ratings and then only you will be able

48
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,320
to pick the best motor for your project

49
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,640
uh then we'll talk about the second part

50
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,479
that is the electronic speed controller

51
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,520
and why it is

52
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,799
required what what it does and how to

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,399
choose that so what different rating it

54
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,280
has

55
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,799
in the last part of the chapter we'll be

56
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,320
talking about batteries

57
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,479
uh obviously the main power source of

58
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,159
your drone or your uavs

59
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,200
we'll be talking about different

60
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
batteries options which are available in

61
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,360
the market

62
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
and we'll talk about the ratings which

63
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
it widget carries and

64
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,719
uh we'll touch up on the charging and

65
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,799
storing of a battery a bit but that

66
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,960
comes later and a short talk on safety

67
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,439
if

68
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,640
we still have the time okay so this is

69
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,318
how a typical brushless

70
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,120
motor look and you can see it it has

71
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,720
quite some parts so

72
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,440
this is the entire motor which is inside

73
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,319
the

74
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,040
metal casing uh i'm gonna cut that open

75
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,040
and i'll show you what inside that but

76
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,200
take a take a bird's eye look on this

77
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,879
motor and take a look at

78
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,800
specifically these numbers so there are

79
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,239
some numbers you can see

80
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,400
uh 22 12 13 1000 kv something like that

81
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,160
so i just i'll be explaining these

82
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,920
numbers but for now just take a look at

83
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,120
that so this is the

84
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,519
motor it has three wires and we'll also

85
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,440
discuss that why it has three wires

86
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,760
uh this is nothing but a mounting uh

87
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,120
mounting plate so if you are

88
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
mounting it on a plane or a drone which

89
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
is not following these

90
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,160
whole patterns then you can use that to

91
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,519
mount this is the main shaft which goes

92
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,000
on top of this and you put the propeller

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,040
over here and

94
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,879
these are the mounting screws so nothing

95
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,280
fancy here and

96
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
i'll quickly move to the overhead cam

97
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,640
and show you all the different kinds of

98
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,400
brushless motor i'm having here so

99
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,239
these all are the brushless motor i'm

100
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,239
having here so you can see this is

101
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,720
uh the smallest one i'm having here so

102
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,560
uh all these are brushless motor but

103
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,159
i just want you to look that how

104
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,319
different they are from each other

105
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,959
all does same work these all are motors

106
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,599
but

107
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,920
every motor is different in terms of the

108
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,680
configuration in terms of

109
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,519
size and maybe uh some shape or whatnot

110
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,200
and also motors on my drone so yes these

111
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,879
all are brushless motors but

112
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,159
every motor is different so i just

113
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,480
wanted you to take a look uh and

114
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,519
we'll touch upon that today so

115
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,239
uh this is how a brushless motor looks

116
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,400
from inside so uh

117
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
basically there are two parts to any

118
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,239
motor one is the

119
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,120
stationary part that stays on the frame

120
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,799
that stays on the body where you mount

121
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,760
the motor

122
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,159
and other is the rotor which is the part

123
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,720
which rotates the motor and which

124
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
which gives you the thrust if you couple

125
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
it with the propeller

126
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,159
or which gives you some torque if you

127
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,159
are coupling it with some gears or

128
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,120
some mechanical assembly so that's how a

129
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,000
motor look

130
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,239
and i want you to look closely in this

131
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,320
part and in this part so you can see

132
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,880
some

133
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,918
copper coils going over over here

134
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,759
uh in the stator and in the rotor you

135
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,919
can see there are some permanent dc

136
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,360
sorry permanent magnets here so this one

137
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,040
rotor is carrying permanent magnets and

138
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,639
this one is carrying a coil

139
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,400
and on the coil there are three

140
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,560
different wires so we'll see how this

141
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,440
work but

142
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,120
if we move to the overhead cam i have

143
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
also opened one of my motor

144
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,919
to give you a closer look so this is the

145
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,520
motor which i opened

146
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,400
and you just need to remove that to get

147
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
inside that

148
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,560
so this is the stator of this motor as

149
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,680
we

150
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,440
as i showed in the ppt this is the same

151
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,120
thing happening over here

152
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,680
with some copper coils wrapped around

153
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,199
this is a stationary part

154
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,440
you can see the motor bearing here and

155
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,320
this is the part

156
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,360
which rotates or it's called the rotor

157
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,400
and it has some magnets so on the bell

158
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,600
the permanent magnets so yes these two

159
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,280
comes together to form this brushless

160
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,919
motor and

161
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,680
we have three wires here so you can see

162
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,840
two but it has three wires one of the

163
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,639
wire

164
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,600
was cut in a crash so that's not an

165
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,280
issue

166
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,160
so yes that's how uh motor looks from

167
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,800
inside

168
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,199
and uh today we're gonna talk about

169
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,440
different kinds of motors so let's start

170
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,800
with different kinds of motor and the

171
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,720
first category we have

172
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,680
when we talk about uh bldc motor or a

173
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,039
brushless dc motor

174
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,240
is in runner and outrunner so basically

175
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,560
uh these two are the types of brushless

176
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,320
dc motor and they

177
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,440
both have their own specific application

178
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
so i want you to focus on the image on

179
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,039
the right hand side first so

180
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,080
you can see on the in runner motor the

181
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,280
magnets the permanent magnets are on the

182
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,160
inside

183
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,919
while the electromagnets are on the

184
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,240
outside while on the outrunner motor

185
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,360
which i just showed you

186
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,600
the permanent magnets are on the rotor

187
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,759
the rotating part

188
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,080
while the electromagnets the coils are

189
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,039
on the inside

190
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,880
on the stator that is a stationary part

191
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,720
so data is the major difference between

192
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:16,960
an

193
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
in-runner motor and the out-runner motor

194
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,880
the positions of

195
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,039
permanent magnets and the electromagnets

196
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,319
are different

197
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,039
in inrunner and outrunner and because of

198
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,319
that they have different

199
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,840
capabilities they have different

200
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
applications

201
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,919
and on the left hand side you can see on

202
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,680
the top you have an out runner motor

203
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
which i just showed you and on the

204
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,080
below you see an in-runner motor which i

205
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,960
don't have

206
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
with me personally but these kinds of

207
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,080
motor are

208
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,720
really common in drill machines and in

209
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,440
some

210
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,639
fans uh these kinds of stuff so

211
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,919
these kinds of motor you will generally

212
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,599
find there while these kinds of motor

213
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,639
you will find uh

214
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,919
on your drones and uavs and rc airplanes

215
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,800
and whatnot

216
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,680
so on this motor the entire uh the

217
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,160
entire

218
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,360
body of this motor rotates while in the

219
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,199
in runner motor only this particular

220
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,759
shaft area rotates so that also

221
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,080
is kind of a difference between these

222
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,199
two motors so

223
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,440
both can be used interchangeably but it

224
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,720
it it is having some different

225
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,840
properties like

226
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,319
inner motor gives you more uh torque

227
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,319
compared to the outer motor but

228
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,080
when coupled with a propeller outer

229
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,680
motor will give you more thrust so

230
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,520
things like that i'm not going very much

231
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,720
into details because

232
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,360
we need to focus on the outer motor bus

233
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,800
but just for your knowledge you should

234
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,520
know that

235
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,680
you also have an option to run an inner

236
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,160
motor where only the shaft rotates and

237
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
maybe in some applications other than

238
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,319
drones these motor comes handy

239
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,639
so this is also another kind of motor

240
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,000
which we used

241
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
in indoor drones specifically so these

242
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,759
are not brushless dc motor as you can

243
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,759
see they don't have three wires going

244
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,000
at the back they just have two wires so

245
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
it can be directly driven

246
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,840
with the battery without the need of

247
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
electronic speed controller

248
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
you can control uh using any driver

249
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,680
basically the speed of this motor

250
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
so they are called coreless dc motor

251
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,599
they can run at a very very high rpm and

252
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,000
mainly

253
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,599
used for indoor drones they don't

254
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,919
particularly have a good uh lifespan or

255
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,240
longevity but that is uh not an issue in

256
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,960
indoor drones

257
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
and they are really cheap so you can

258
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,720
replace them easily so

259
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,960
uh just for your knowledge there also

260
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,800
exists this coreless dc motor which you

261
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,840
can also use in your

262
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,919
in your drone project more specifically

263
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
for smaller indoor drones they are being

264
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,880
used

265
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,279
so this is an interesting slide and this

266
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,440
is where the actual fun begins so

267
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,159
i wanted to touch a bit about electric

268
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,958
field magnetic field and motion and

269
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,800
this is the concept which you might have

270
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,519
also studied in your high school maybe

271
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,000
or

272
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,640
in your university or or a grad school

273
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,120
if you

274
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,839
are from an engineering background or

275
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,040
something similar

276
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,279
so uh basically there is a relation

277
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,080
between uh

278
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
these three the electric field the

279
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,839
magnetic field and the motion

280
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,080
and i'll uh and you might remember from

281
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,760
the high school the fleming's left hand

282
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,560
right hand rule

283
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,800
uh these kinds of things so they

284
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,600
actually

285
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
tell the relationship between these

286
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,800
three uh uh

287
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,760
entities uh so basically the in a

288
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,480
nutshell

289
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,640
the rule of thumb is uh if you have

290
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,680
electric field

291
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,720
and magnetic field you can get motion

292
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
if you have motion and electric field

293
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
then you can get an electric field so

294
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,519
that is the entire idea behind motors

295
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,720
and generators

296
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,959
in case of motors you have electric

297
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,959
field you have a magnetic field

298
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,200
you get the motion while in case of

299
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,279
generator you have motion

300
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,040
you have magnetic field and you get

301
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,640
electric field so generator gives you

302
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,600
electricity

303
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,279
while motor takes the electricity and

304
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,600
gives you motion so i'm gonna do a small

305
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,519
experiment here and move to the overhead

306
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,959
camera

307
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,839
so this is a small dc motor which i'm

308
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,800
having so

309
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,120
uh everybody knows how a motor works so

310
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
these having two terminals you just need

311
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,519
to

312
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,079
provide the electric current or electric

313
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,600
voltage potential over here and it will

314
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,640
start rotating

315
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,480
so that is not an experiment today

316
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,399
everyone can do that everyone has done

317
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:08,880
that

318
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,720
uh what i want to show you is that this

319
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,200
motor can also act as a generator

320
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,519
and what i mean by that is we know that

321
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,120
this motor has some magnets

322
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,279
built in we are providing electricity

323
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,040
and it gives you motion

324
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,839
but because it already has magnet inside

325
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,600
if we are providing some motion

326
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,279
then it should act as a generator and

327
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,120
give us electricity so that is what we

328
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,720
are going to experiment today

329
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
so i have a small led with me here so

330
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,640
let's see if i can

331
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,720
i can show you here so i'm gonna connect

332
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,120
my led to the terminals i'm gonna just

333
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,839
uh

334
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,279
put my hands there and see if that works

335
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,279
so i've connected led on the terminals

336
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,200
of this motor so

337
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
if the connection is good and i rotate

338
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,360
that you can see led should shine

339
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,079
so let's make the connection first i

340
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,320
should have done with the wires but

341
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,079
there you go so you can see as i am

342
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,760
rotating the motor

343
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,680
you are seeing the led is blinking so

344
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,040
what happening here is

345
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,200
as i mentioned we have magnets here so

346
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,640
we have a magnetic field

347
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,040
and we are providing motion so magnetic

348
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,800
field and motions give you electric

349
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,079
field so that is exactly what is

350
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,600
happening here so this is a small

351
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,079
experiment

352
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,560
which you can do and this proves that

353
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,000
motor can also act as a generator

354
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
so that is entire relationship between

355
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,519
uh these

356
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,240
three entities so to speak so in case of

357
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,720
motor on the left you can see that

358
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,959
this is called an armature in case of dc

359
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:31,760
motors

360
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,480
uh we have different uh different uh

361
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,040
name

362
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,200
nomenclature when it comes to ac and dc

363
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,160
and i'll

364
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,279
i'll touch upon that in later slides so

365
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,120
this is the coil which carries the

366
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,200
current and current is coming from this

367
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,360
battery so this is carrying the current

368
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,519
this is having an electric field

369
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,519
and here you can see a permanent magnet

370
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,200
is the north pole and the south pole

371
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,440
so because we have electric field we

372
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,880
have magnetic field

373
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,959
this start this amh this armature will

374
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,800
start rotating so this is the motion

375
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,160
which you are getting

376
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,200
uh similarly in case of a generator your

377
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,720
coil is already rotating

378
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
you have the magnetic field so across

379
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,639
the across the coil you will get some

380
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,000
electric field and you can

381
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
connect a voltmeter here and you can

382
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,920
check that you are getting some

383
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
voltage out of it so data is a

384
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,120
relationship between electric field

385
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,440
magnetic field and motion

386
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,880
and this relationship says universal

387
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,040
uh for whatever you are uh looking at

388
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,160
maybe it's a dc

389
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,440
motor or single phase ac motor or

390
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,920
a three-phase ac motor or synchronous

391
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,839
motor this concept does not change

392
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,920
uh maybe the nature of magnetic field

393
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
changes maybe the nature of electric

394
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,880
field changes

395
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
or the direction of motion changes but

396
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,120
overall this concept remains

397
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,079
uh same throughout uh irrespective of

398
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,279
you are working on dc

399
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,120
or ac or single phase or three-phase or

400
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,880
multi-phase or whatever

401
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,519
but that is the basic thing i wanted you

402
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,560
to clear before

403
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
moving ahead all right so moving ahead

404
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,839
let's talk about

405
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,440
some questions that you might be having

406
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,279
because i know from my previous workshop

407
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,480
a lot of my students have these

408
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,880
questions and it could be as simple as

409
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
why this motor has three wires because

410
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,600
all the motors that

411
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,920
we generally see they have two wires you

412
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,639
uh provide a current uh

413
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,079
across the two wires and the motors

414
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,079
start rotating then why this brushless

415
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,399
motor has three wires and uh

416
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,920
you might be having some question like

417
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,760
what exactly is a brush and why

418
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,200
we are talking about brushes and

419
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,120
brushless and what exactly are those

420
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,000
things so

421
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,959
let's uh talk about how a motor works so

422
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,880
i told you that

423
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,279
in case of a motor we have a permanent

424
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,519
magnets which provides a magnetic field

425
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,839
we provide the electric current across

426
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:40,639
the coil

427
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,480
that creates an electric field and

428
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,079
because of that electric field and

429
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,160
magnetic field we get some motion

430
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
but but how exactly are we getting in

431
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,079
motion so what exactly happening is we

432
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,160
are changing the electric field

433
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,720
and uh let's let's see this diagram on

434
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,760
the left so this is

435
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,399
north pole and this is south pole and

436
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,240
you also know that because of electric

437
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,000
field a magnetic field is also

438
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,920
gets generated so we are providing an

439
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,000
electric field and this act as an

440
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,079
electromagnet because this is a coil

441
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,639
now let's say uh the current is flowing

442
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,480
from this direction and this part of the

443
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,199
coil becomes

444
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,680
north so north and north will repel each

445
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,240
other

446
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,199
and this will come into this side now

447
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,399
what we are doing we

448
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,279
are changing the polarity of this now as

449
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,040
soon as the north comes here

450
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,199
this will become south and the south and

451
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,199
south will repel and this keeps on

452
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,360
rotating and you'll get the motion

453
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,519
that is how and motor exactly work by

454
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,360
alternating the voltage

455
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,680
between the coil now the question is how

456
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,440
are we alternating the voltage because

457
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,000
we are using a battery and battery is a

458
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,959
dc source

459
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,279
it has a fixed source so in case of

460
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,519
brushed dc motor the answer

461
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,519
lies in this part so this is called a

462
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,519
commutator so commutator is

463
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,839
uh nothing so far now just understand

464
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,800
that commutator

465
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,240
is a small component of a motor that

466
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,199
helps in alternating the input source of

467
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,440
electric field so that's all

468
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,839
now what is the role of brushes so when

469
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,839
the coil is rotating you still need to

470
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,839
keep provide the electric field so that

471
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,360
is where the brushes comes into the

472
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,000
handy

473
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
so brushes are nothing but a small

474
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,160
wires of carbon generally and they are

475
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
conductive in nature so these are

476
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,480
uh help these helps in continuously

477
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,240
providing the electric field to the coil

478
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,480
even it's when it's rotating

479
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,120
that is exactly also becomes a drawback

480
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,519
of

481
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,320
brush dc motor because what is having is

482
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,720
uh

483
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,440
contact between the brushes and the

484
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,680
coils and because of this contact

485
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,600
there would be a friction when the when

486
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
the coil is rotating and because of this

487
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,399
friction lot of heat will be generated

488
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,800
so what i'm trying to say is that this

489
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
brushes are not very efficient

490
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,880
these are the mechanical assembly they

491
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,120
have a contact they have a friction

492
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,600
a lot of power is being wasted into heat

493
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,120
over the time and

494
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,720
because of the mechanical assembly they

495
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,639
also are prone to wear and tear so that

496
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,000
is why brushes are

497
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,759
not very efficient they don't have a

498
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,920
much life so that is why brush motors

499
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,320
are

500
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,800
not useful for something like drones

501
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,600
where we need

502
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
good performance where we need good

503
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,440
efficiency where we need lot of

504
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
input power converted into output power

505
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,000
and there is less wastage less friction

506
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,720
less heat that is why we come to

507
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,480
something called brushless motor so as

508
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,160
you can see on the right we have a

509
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,440
brushless motor

510
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,680
and instead of for two coils as in case

511
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,600
of brush motor we have three coils here

512
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,240
and

513
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,199
we are alternating these uh current in

514
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,279
this coil so basically what is happening

515
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,959
we are providing

516
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,920
a three-phase ac source in the brushless

517
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,399
motor

518
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,720
instead of a dc source and the property

519
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,320
of three-phase ac sources it has a

520
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
rotating magnetic field so

521
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,959
it keeps on rotating and the permanent

522
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,000
magnets are here

523
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,120
so because of this relative rotation of

524
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,320
electric field

525
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,240
and coming in contact with the magnetic

526
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
field we get the continuous motion so as

527
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,440
you can see there is no physical contact

528
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,279
between the rotor and the stator or

529
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,959
there is no brush assembly

530
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,679
brushless motors are very efficient they

531
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,799
are very

532
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,000
powerful they are not prone to friction

533
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,839
losses or heat losses and there is no

534
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,359
mechanical assembly so there is very

535
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,280
less wear and tear so that is the reason

536
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,520
we use uh brushless motor for something

537
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,599
like drone where we need very high

538
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,280
efficiency very high performances so

539
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,720
this also explained why it has three

540
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,319
wires so basically we are having three

541
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,440
coils and we are providing a three-phase

542
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,360
voltage source that is why we need three

543
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,799
wires uh now

544
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,679
the question uh which can arise is where

545
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,039
are we getting the three-phase

546
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,200
source because we are using a battery

547
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,080
and that is why

548
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,520
electronic speed controller comes in

549
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,000
handy so electronic speed controller uh

550
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,080
what they are doing they are taking a

551
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,600
battery source the dc source and

552
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,679
converting it into a three-phase ac

553
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,240
source

554
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,520
so they are uh doing something which is

555
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,960
called inversion or

556
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,039
in water as we use in our homes to

557
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,960
convert dc to ac sometimes

558
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
especially in india so esc is nothing

559
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,160
but an inverter

560
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,320
and while doing that it can also

561
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,080
regulate how much voltage to supply to

562
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,280
each coil and

563
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,039
based on that they can control the speed

564
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,320
so we'll discuss

565
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,440
more in the esc chapter but

566
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,160
for now let's move to the motor ratings

567
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
so when you go out to the market to buy

568
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,919
brushes dc motor for your next drone

569
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,640
project you will be overwhelmed to see

570
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,559
all kind of numbers the motors are

571
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,320
associated with and they can be very

572
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,760
confusing and

573
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,000
that is what we are here for and we are

574
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,840
discussing the motor rating so

575
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,080
uh as i told that if you cut open this

576
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,000
motor from the gut you'll see you have a

577
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
starter and you have

578
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,480
a rotor a rotor is generally

579
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,400
in case of drone community is also known

580
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,679
as the motor bell

581
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,440
which carries the permanent magnets and

582
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,320
this stator which has the electromagnets

583
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,840
or the coils are sometimes

584
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,880
referred as the uh motor base this

585
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
uh this is the one which you mount on

586
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,320
the drone and

587
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,120
of course we need both to work but uh uh

588
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,280
i wanted to specifically focus you on to

589
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,799
the stator side because

590
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,440
these uh are the things on the on the

591
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,120
left the stator which

592
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,760
drastically changes the motor behavior

593
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,360
which drastically changes the motor

594
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,400
performances

595
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,120
and what i mean by that is i want you to

596
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,880
focus on these numbers so

597
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,640
when you go and you want to buy a motor

598
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,080
for your drone project you will be

599
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,880
presented by these kinds of numbers so

600
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,679
a manufacturer may refer it as a

601
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,960
2306 2300 kv motor so what exactly is

602
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,520
this

603
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,440
number and what should we conclude with

604
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
this number so

605
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,799
a motor rating is divided into three

606
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,080
parts and

607
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,160
as i am showing on the screen so the

608
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,280
first two numbers

609
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,840
is nothing but the width of the stator

610
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,280
in millimeter

611
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
the second set of number is nothing but

612
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,039
the length of the stator in millimeter

613
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,799
and i wanted to focus only on

614
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,080
these two numbers for now so uh this is

615
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,880
the stator

616
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,919
and if i go to uh this

617
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,760
motor so this is the stator

618
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,200
over here and this is the entire width

619
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,559
of the stator

620
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,760
and this is the length of the stator and

621
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,360
if i look at this motor bell

622
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,960
it is written 22 0 2208 so that means

623
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,720
that the stator is

624
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,320
22 millimeter in width and 8 millimeter

625
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,120
in height

626
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,799
so similarly on the on the slide if you

627
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,240
are

628
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,440
seeing this number 2306 for this motor

629
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,559
it means that

630
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,760
this motor is 23 millimeter

631
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,640
uh wide in terms of the stator and six

632
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,360
millimeter

633
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,520
length in terms of the shutter length so

634
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,799
that is the stator height

635
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,720
and that is the shutter width only the

636
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,400
part which has the

637
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,120
coils which has the electromagnet so why

638
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,720
these numbers matter because

639
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,880
these numbers define the performance of

640
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,919
this motor

641
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,320
and what i mean by that is more the

642
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
width of the stator more

643
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,080
torque your motor provides at lower rpm

644
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,799
more the length of the stator more power

645
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,440
it provides at higher rpm so that is a

646
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,480
simple

647
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,360
fundamental to explain these numbers so

648
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:15,760
uh

649
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,880
if you have a a wider stator

650
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,120
basically you are having more metal

651
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,320
going into that

652
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,400
basically you will be having more coil

653
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,080
going into that and because of that

654
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,640
you'll get

655
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
more torque at lower rpm that is if you

656
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,320
are flying let's say

657
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,120
uh 20 throttle or 30 throttle then you

658
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,520
will get

659
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,000
more torque and the torque is necessary

660
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,640
because

661
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
in initially when you are taking off the

662
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,960
drone uh you need a higher torque

663
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,679
to rotate the propeller and to take off

664
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,400
uh

665
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,919
but at uh at higher rpm uh for example

666
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,039
if you are flying

667
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,679
in a in a drone racing competition where

668
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,840
you need more power then you need to go

669
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,480
for a mod

670
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,960
motor that has having a higher stator

671
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,520
length

672
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,600
for example this motor is having a six

673
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,120
millimeter of stator length while the

674
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
motor which i showed you in the overhead

675
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,840
camera

676
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,080
having eight millimeter of phosphater

677
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
length so that motor will provide me

678
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,480
more power at higher rpm like 70

679
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,919
or 80 percent throttle but this motor is

680
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,520
having 23 millimeter

681
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,000
of stator width and that one is having

682
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,080
22 millimeter of center width so this

683
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,640
one

684
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,480
on the screen will provide me more

685
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,720
torque at lower rpm so

686
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,000
i am able to spin a heavier propeller on

687
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,440
this motor very easily

688
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,360
because this motor is having more torque

689
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,600
and this would be able to rotate heavier

690
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,120
propeller compared to the motor which is

691
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,760
having less

692
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,440
torque and because of those heavy

693
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,960
propeller they will also give me more

694
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,400
thrust and so on

695
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,520
uh but as i already mentioned in

696
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,000
both of the previous classes everything

697
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,200
in case of

698
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,520
building drones is about trade-off uh

699
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,440
you gain something you lose another

700
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,320
things and

701
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,520
same is true for motor as well so

702
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
you can buy a motor which is having a

703
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
good stater length or a good stator

704
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,799
width which has a

705
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,720
more torque at lower rpm which has very

706
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,240
high power at higher rpm

707
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,919
but what you will lose obviously you

708
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,960
will lose your flight time because

709
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,720
of more power it will consume more

710
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,039
current you will get less flight time so

711
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,799
you need to find a sweet spot and

712
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,480
everything in drone is about finding the

713
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,440
sweet spot

714
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,720
so that is why uh there are some certain

715
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,360
numbers

716
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,520
uh which you need to keep in mind so i'm

717
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,720
gonna discuss that in

718
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,559
in the next slide hopefully where i'll

719
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,320
show you some common motors which are

720
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,679
used for drone racing

721
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,640
uh fpv drone freestyle and some motors

722
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,240
which are used for bigger drones like

723
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,000
450 size drones

724
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,919
which are used for aerial cinematography

725
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,279
and whatnot so

726
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,799
these are the two numbers and i want you

727
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,400
to keep that in mind

728
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,799
apart from that there is a third number

729
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,840
associated with the motor and that is

730
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,880
the kv rating of the motor and uh it is

731
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,919
not kilo volt

732
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,320
as uh confused by a lot of the people

733
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,000
listening to this first time

734
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,440
uh kv stands for rpm per volt

735
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,640
that is revolutions per minute per

736
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,679
volt so in case of this motor this motor

737
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,480
is having 2300 kv that means

738
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,039
this motor can revolve 2300 revolutions

739
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,159
in one minute on one volt so

740
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,880
you can do the maths and we fly with a

741
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,679
battery of

742
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,159
12 volt 16 volt 22 volts and you

743
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,440
multiply with that

744
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,919
that is the total rpm this motor can

745
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:28,960
rotate

746
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,120
so if you talk about uh i've given a

747
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,000
simple calculation

748
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,520
to make things simple so uh i'll go back

749
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,120
to the overhead camera one more time so

750
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,840
all these motors has a different rpm

751
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,679
different kv rating so if i talk about

752
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,799
this motor

753
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,320
this one is having 20 to 80 kv if i talk

754
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,440
about this motor

755
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,600
this motor is having 2600 kv

756
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,960
this motor is having 1800 kv

757
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,000
and this motor is having 1000 kv

758
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
so we have a formula for 1000 kv and

759
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,080
if i rotate this motor let's say 12 volt

760
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,679
or a 3 cell battery

761
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,720
then 1000 into 12 volt

762
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,880
will give you 12 000 revolutions per

763
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,039
minute so that is the idea behind kv

764
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:15,679
rating

765
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,279
rpm per volt now one thing you can

766
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,760
conclude from here is

767
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,320
as i already mentioned that there is not

768
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,520
one motor which is

769
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,400
fit for you depending on what you need

770
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,919
your drone to be

771
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,240
the thrust to weight ratio you need as

772
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,520
we discussed in the last class and the

773
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,720
class before that

774
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,039
how much thrust you need how much weight

775
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,400
your drone is carrying

776
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,919
based on that you need to pick your

777
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,760
motor and propeller

778
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,440
so what i mean by that is uh let's say

779
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,080
you want a smaller drone uh which have

780
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,880
which can spin

781
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,960
a four or five inch propeller but you

782
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,400
want a one kg thrust

783
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,360
so you need a smaller motor which with

784
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,559
very high rpm

785
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,799
you cannot go low on rpm because you

786
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,640
want your motor to spin at a very high

787
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,000
rpm only then

788
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,919
you will be able to get adequate thrust

789
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,440
for a smaller propeller

790
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,039
now let's say you have a bigger frame

791
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,559
and you are able to fly

792
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,240
a big propeller let's say a 10 inch

793
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,000
propeller or 12 inch propeller

794
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,159
then you need to go for a lower kv motor

795
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,080
or a lower rpm motor because

796
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,919
if you are spinning a bigger propeller

797
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,159
with a very high rpm motor

798
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,360
then bigger propeller very high rpm will

799
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,279
will produce a lot of air resistance and

800
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,960
your motor will burn out so

801
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,440
in that case you need to go for a lower

802
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,640
rpm motor if you are

803
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,720
running a bigger propeller so rule of

804
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,880
thumb is the bigger the propeller the

805
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,200
less rpm you need to get equal amount of

806
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:37,760
thrust

807
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,840
so let's say you need 1 kg of thrust

808
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,200
from a smaller motor

809
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,919
then you need smaller motor high rpm you

810
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,320
need same 1 kg of thrust with bigger

811
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,840
propeller 10 inch propeller then you

812
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,520
need a smaller rpm motor

813
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,919
so that is how we do mix and match

814
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,360
things we adjust things

815
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,880
and that is how we come up with the

816
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,200
different uh drone frames having

817
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,520
different kinds of motors

818
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,919
so as i mentioned uh these are the

819
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,919
typical motor rating so if you want to

820
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,080
build a mini quad like this one which

821
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,320
can spin a propeller four to five

822
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,799
four to six inches then the common sizes

823
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,840
available are

824
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840
twenty two zero four twenty two zero

825
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
five and make sure the first set of

826
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,720
number is

827
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,120
uh the the width of the stator in

828
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,080
millimeter

829
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,240
the second set is the length of the

830
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,440
shutter in millimeter so 2204 means 22

831
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,320
millimeter

832
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,440
width and 4 millimeter height so 2204

833
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,840
2205 2206 2207

834
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,919
2305 2306 2307

835
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,640
these are the common motors for a four

836
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,919
to six inch propeller

837
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,440
and in terms of kv you have 1750 kv you

838
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,720
have 2000 kv 2300 and 2600

839
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,559
so again kv stands for rpm per volt

840
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,039
so if you are running a battery with the

841
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,640
higher voltage let's say you are running

842
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,279
a 6 cell battery with 22 volts

843
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,080
then you need a lower kv motor lower rpm

844
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,960
motor because

845
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
effectively when you multiply a smaller

846
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,640
number with a bigger number it will

847
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,799
get a bigger number and in the same way

848
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,720
you need a 2600 kv if you are let's say

849
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
running a 3 cell battery or 11

850
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,120
12 volts battery uh then a bigger number

851
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,480
multiply with a smaller number you'll

852
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:14,960
get

853
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,760
the adequate amount of thrust and i'm

854
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,159
hope

855
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,039
i'm able to make things clear by that so

856
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,279
everything is a mix and match and

857
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,880
finding that sweet spot in terms of

858
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,600
drone talking about this drone is also

859
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,640
very common drone

860
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,000
people make a 450 swiss quadcopter

861
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,679
the common motor which are available in

862
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,039
the market are 22

863
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,320
1 to 22 1 4 24 1 to

864
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,120
these kinds of motors so i'm also having

865
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,720
one motor over here

866
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,480
so this is the one i used to make a

867
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,159
bigger quads and if i talk about this

868
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,320
rating it's 20 to 13

869
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,600
935 kv so you can see that difference so

870
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,200
this one is 20 to 13

871
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,559
930 kv and this one is 22

872
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,760
5 2600 kv so both of

873
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,640
motor provides a 1 kg of thrust but this

874
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,720
require 5 inch propeller for 1 kg of

875
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,360
thrust

876
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,960
and this required 10 inch propeller for

877
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,559
one kg of thrust

878
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,840
so that is about finding the sweet spot

879
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,399
in terms of more so we talked about how

880
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,919
the length and width of

881
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,600
the stator determines the motor

882
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,679
performance but are there anything else

883
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,679
that can impact the motor performance

884
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:22,799
and the answer is

885
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,919
simply yes so every component of this

886
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,840
motor can impact the motor performance

887
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,480
whether

888
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,360
it is the shaft the bearing the windings

889
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,679
uh

890
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,279
everything even the quality of the

891
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,880
magnet to use so

892
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,360
uh this is how a general pressure dc

893
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,279
motor look and in the drone community we

894
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,200
call this the motor bell which has the

895
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,559
permanent magnets

896
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,200
this is the shaft which rest on the

897
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,080
stator and

898
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,000
this also has the propeller on the other

899
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,960
side this is the stator which has

900
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,000
the coil carrying three-phase ac

901
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,480
current and this is a bearing on which

902
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
the rotor rotates so this bearing can be

903
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,960
made of ceramic or some other metals and

904
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,360
everything will determine the motor

905
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,080
performance

906
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,480
and more specifically these

907
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,960
electromagnets and these magnets these

908
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,240
are

909
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,159
the the the parts which determines the

910
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,520
motor performance a lot

911
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,440
uh apart from the stator width and the

912
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,720
height of course which we already

913
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,679
discussed

914
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,919
so these are nothing but the copper

915
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:20,960
winding

916
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,919
around around around this the stator and

917
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:24,799
the number of

918
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,039
turns the gauge of the wire used the

919
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,279
quality of this wire used

920
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,760
the total number of electromagnets and

921
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,440
what are the quality of these magnets

922
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,919
they

923
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,919
together determine the motor performance

924
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,520
and uh they are called

925
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,960
poles and the magnets so the poles are

926
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,039
uh the electromagnet part which are on

927
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,279
the stator and the magnets are

928
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,520
uh the part of the rotor which is on the

929
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,880
bell so

930
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,279
depending on how much poles and how much

931
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,600
magnets your a motor is having

932
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,640
the performance of motor changes and

933
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,039
the general rule of thumb is more number

934
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,960
of poles that is more number of

935
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,880
electromagnets the motor is having

936
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,919
the smoother will be the motor and the

937
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,840
less number of poles the motor is having

938
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,919
the powerful will be the motor so

939
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,640
again you see a trade-off so you want a

940
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,679
smoother motor

941
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,600
so your drone performs very smooth in

942
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,519
the air the drone is stable

943
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,919
but if you keep adding poles then you

944
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,519
will keep losing power so you need to

945
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,279
find a sweet spot and

946
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,440
generally speaking uh if you talk about

947
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,640
fpv drone racing

948
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,720
12 poles or 14 poles these are the

949
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,159
common number of poles

950
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,480
which you will find on this theater and

951
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,760
uh

952
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,480
sometimes you can also look into the

953
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,760
specifications of

954
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,000
a motor manufacturer and you'll find uh

955
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,799
12 n

956
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,679
14p and what it means it has 12

957
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,080
electromagnets and 14 permanent magnets

958
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,559
and

959
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,399
again electromagnets are nothing but the

960
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,919
coil on the stator

961
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,679
and permanent magnets are nothing but

962
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,840
these magnets on the rotor

963
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,880
and again more number of poles you have

964
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,799
more smooth will be the motor fewer

965
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,799
poles you have the powerful will be the

966
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,519
motor

967
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,679
and over the period of time since i

968
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,279
first started uh

969
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,440
making drones and planes the motor has

970
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,559
evolved a lot

971
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,159
and based on these factors like

972
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,559
what kind of wire you has used how many

973
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,360
turns

974
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,880
each pole is having what is the gauge of

975
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,679
this wire

976
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,240
what is the quality of this wire what is

977
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,039
the

978
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,519
the amount of gap between permanent

979
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,279
magnets and electromagnets so this is

980
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,799
called an air gap so you want

981
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,440
this gap to be minimum but of course it

982
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,320
cannot be zero

983
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,760
otherwise your motor will not rotate

984
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,440
there has to be some gap

985
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,120
so what manufacturers are doing they

986
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,480
have come up with something called

987
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,320
curved magnets so these magnets you are

988
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,240
seeing they are basically rectangular

989
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,760
but now they started making curved

990
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,600
magnets so you have very less air gap

991
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,440
between your rotor and the stator

992
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,519
so again everything impacts the

993
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,120
performance and

994
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,840
what are what are magnet heat

995
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,960
capabilities

996
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,720
so uh there is something which is called

997
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,640
demagnetization so at higher temperature

998
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,720
uh the magnets start losing its

999
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,960
magnetism and that is very common in

1000
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,559
permanent magnets so

1001
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,320
because of extensive flying uh this

1002
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,399
motor can get hot and these magnets can

1003
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,720
demagnetize themselves so that is why

1004
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,200
manufacturers are using very high uh

1005
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,120
heat capability magnets so your motor

1006
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,159
performs a

1007
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,080
linear performance even at a very high

1008
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,559
speed or a

1009
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,360
very uh hot day so that is the

1010
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,120
technology which is being involved and

1011
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,000
it it's true for every new field so new

1012
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,840
and new things are coming every day

1013
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,240
a stutter lamination is this material on

1014
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,679
the on the side

1015
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,440
this is being laminated by some

1016
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,679
materials i'm not really sure what so

1017
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,159
bearing this bearing is made of ceramic

1018
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:44,880
or

1019
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,480
metal and new motors they called ceramic

1020
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,600
japanese bearing

1021
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,640
and the balance of this bill

1022
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,720
that means the each magnet is having

1023
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,679
same

1024
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,559
weight so it's perfectly balanced so uh

1025
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,960
what i mean by all these things is uh

1026
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,360
all these things manufacturers needs to

1027
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,440
keep in mind to give you the best motor

1028
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,800
out of out of their offerings but we do

1029
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,599
not need to

1030
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,440
worry that much about it we just need to

1031
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,440
worry about the width the height

1032
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,760
maybe number of poles and magnets but

1033
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,879
these things we should

1034
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,560
leave on manufacturer but this is good

1035
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,960
to know that air gaps and what magnets

1036
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,159
are using and

1037
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,918
what lamination they are using they all

1038
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,760
affect the motor performance and

1039
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,359
if we are someone who is not making a

1040
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,280
motor then we can definitely skip these

1041
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,239
parts and

1042
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,879
i have mentioned this link here so oscar

1043
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,320
is

1044
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,399
a great blogger on drones and you can

1045
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,520
find more about

1046
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,918
all this stuff on this link so feel free

1047
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,599
to visit and

1048
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,480
learn from there all right so moving

1049
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,599
ahead to the second

1050
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,760
part of this chapter data is the

1051
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,520
electronic speed controller so

1052
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,960
this is how an electronic speed

1053
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,560
controller looks like and

1054
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,040
i have some with me on the overhead

1055
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,159
camera so

1056
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,000
this is like the one which you are

1057
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,440
seeing on the screen

1058
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,440
as well uh here we go and

1059
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,320
this is the same one i believe and this

1060
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,960
is another electronic speed controller

1061
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
there are some other so you it comes in

1062
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,800
all shapes and sizes and configuration

1063
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,359
and

1064
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,880
this is another interesting electronic

1065
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,720
speed control it's a four in one

1066
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,640
because we have four motors we need to

1067
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,320
use four electronic speed controller so

1068
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,599
instead of using four different

1069
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,200
electronic speed controller you can use

1070
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,400
a four in one

1071
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,760
this sits on top of your flight

1072
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,079
controller and communicate directly so

1073
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,760
all kinds of things are available in the

1074
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,240
market these days so

1075
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,400
uh what is the main role of an

1076
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,160
electronic speed controller it's nothing

1077
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,560
but

1078
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,520
as i mentioned that the bldc motor it's

1079
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,560
uh

1080
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,000
it's actually a three-phase ac motor so

1081
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,079
the battery is applying a dc current

1082
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,920
your motor needs a three-phase ac

1083
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,640
current

1084
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,800
this conversion is being done by the

1085
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,320
electronic speed controller

1086
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,160
so here you can see electronic speed

1087
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,000
controller has the three wires

1088
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,119
which connects to your motor uh for each

1089
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,720
coil for three-phase uh

1090
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,119
motor here you have two wires this

1091
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,800
connect to the battery the positive and

1092
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,680
the negative

1093
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,520
and this is another wire which is called

1094
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,680
a signal wire it connects to your flight

1095
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,119
controller and your flight controller

1096
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,320
will tell

1097
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,200
at what speed i want you to to spin the

1098
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,280
motor at how much rpm i need

1099
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,960
electronic speed controller to spin a

1100
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,280
motor and that is uh the basic

1101
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,960
fundamental behind the drone

1102
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,880
the flight controller takes input from

1103
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,160
the user

1104
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,560
the flat controller translates that into

1105
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,400
the rpm for each motor

1106
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,240
and the rpm is being controlled by

1107
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,079
electronic speed controller so

1108
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,760
electronic speed controller does two

1109
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,079
part number one conversion from dc to

1110
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,280
three phase ac

1111
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,200
number two control the speed by taking

1112
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,880
input from a flight controller

1113
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,359
in case of plane where there is no

1114
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,040
flight controller in case of rc plane

1115
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,079
then this uh

1116
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,680
signal wire connects directly to the

1117
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,440
receiver on the throttle channel

1118
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,359
and on the value of throttle is being

1119
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,440
sent by the user and the speed of the

1120
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:55,920
motor

1121
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,240
the rpm of the motor is being controlled

1122
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,880
by this esc so when we talk about esc it

1123
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,599
also has

1124
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,680
some ratings beyond which you cannot go

1125
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,880
so it has a

1126
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,200
voltage rating and a current rating

1127
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,000
voltage rating

1128
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,400
is the maximum voltage and eac can

1129
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,119
handle

1130
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,960
and the current rating is a maximum

1131
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,040
current any ac can handle and

1132
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,560
if you give more voltage if you give

1133
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,640
more current you will destroy your esc

1134
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,520
they will

1135
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,560
burn so never exceed this voltage and

1136
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,839
current rating and

1137
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,440
uh these are mentioned by the

1138
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,680
manufacturer and uh mostly these are

1139
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,720
mentioned on

1140
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,520
uh the esc itself so if i talk about

1141
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,400
this esa

1142
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,240
it's a 30 amp esc and it says

1143
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,599
2 to 4s so that means i can use a 2 cell

1144
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,440
to 4 cell battery maximum

1145
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,240
and it is a 30 ampere esc so this esc

1146
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,160
cannot supply greater than 30

1147
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,640
ampere of current so what i mean by that

1148
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,400
is if you current

1149
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,200
if you connect this esc to this motor

1150
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,720
and you are rotating a five inch

1151
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,359
propeller

1152
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,000
make sure that this motor and that

1153
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,760
propeller is not taking

1154
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,560
more than 30 amperes because this esc

1155
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,640
has a limitation of 30 ampere

1156
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,720
and if you if this motor and propeller

1157
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,320
takes more than 30 ampere then you will

1158
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,880
destroy the csc you will burn the csc so

1159
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,280
make sure to never uh go beyond the

1160
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,320
current limit

1161
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,480
and the voltage limit is nothing but

1162
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,000
what battery i can apply to

1163
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,160
it so this is saying 2 to 4s so i can

1164
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,359
apply a maximum

1165
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,520
4 cell battery and i cannot go beyond 4

1166
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,599
cell battery so if you want to use a

1167
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,720
22 volt system or a 6 cell battery you

1168
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,560
cannot use the csu then you need to go

1169
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,160
for something like

1170
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,720
a 6 cell esc something like that so this

1171
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,480
esc can support up to 6 cell

1172
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,720
so you need to figure your system out

1173
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,400
and this is the basic connection so this

1174
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,079
one goes to the battery this one goes to

1175
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,440
the motor and this one goes to the

1176
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
flight controller the signal wire

1177
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,160
and every motor needs one esc to rotate

1178
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,720
so

1179
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,640
if you are making a quadcopter with the

1180
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,839
four motors you need

1181
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,359
four esc's and uh one last thing there

1182
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,440
is a burst current rating these days in

1183
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,160
esc

1184
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,280
and what it means that for some time it

1185
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,800
can go beyond

1186
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,920
its current limit so let's say your ac

1187
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,560
has a normal current rating of 30

1188
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,839
amperes and a bar

1189
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,079
and a burst current rating of 50 amperes

1190
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,640
so for 5 to 10 second your esc can

1191
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,560
handle 50 amperes but not

1192
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,240
more than that time period and why it is

1193
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,920
important is sometimes

1194
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,599
you are racing and you are on the last

1195
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,599
lap and you just need full power you

1196
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,320
have

1197
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,400
and that is where the burst current

1198
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,680
ratings comes handy

1199
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,119
so you can give full throttle for five

1200
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,720
to ten seconds and you will not harm

1201
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,079
your esc so

1202
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,839
that is a good thing there so esc's they

1203
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,800
have a small microcontroller which runs

1204
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,400
a firmware which runs a piece of

1205
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,200
software

1206
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,960
and what this piece of software is doing

1207
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,520
it is so this is a signal wire

1208
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,760
and it gets a signal from receiver and

1209
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,680
flight controller and to understand this

1210
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,400
signal

1211
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,920
uh the the processor on this esc that

1212
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,839
works on a listening protocol so esc and

1213
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,599
flight controller they agree that they

1214
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,040
will speak a common protocol

1215
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
so flat controller sending the signal in

1216
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,319
terms of

1217
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,720
zeros and one or in terms of analog

1218
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,520
pulses

1219
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,359
and that microcontroller will read that

1220
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,640
pulses or

1221
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,880
the bit stream of zeros and one and it

1222
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,760
will understand

1223
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,079
uh how much rpm i need to rotate my

1224
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,839
motor as requested by the flight

1225
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,359
controller so that is

1226
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,280
why the esc needs a software to

1227
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,359
understand the signal

1228
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,240
and you can definitely write your own

1229
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,040
program

1230
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,280
for the ac on firmware for this esc but

1231
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,960
there are some

1232
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,280
firmwares already open source available

1233
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,200
and by the way your esc comes already

1234
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,960
flash with some firmware so when you buy

1235
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,560
an esc you do not need to worry what

1236
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,920
firmware you want to flash

1237
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,160
it comes already with the firmware but

1238
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,760
definitely if you are making your own

1239
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,800
esa which is

1240
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,200
absolutely possible then you can use

1241
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,000
these open source firmware like bl heli

1242
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,280
bl heli s and bl heli32

1243
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,599
so these are kind of firmware which are

1244
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,640
available uh

1245
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,560
in the open source community simon k is

1246
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,319
also a firmware which is very old

1247
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,640
uh not used anymore and there are also

1248
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,000
some closed source firmware which are

1249
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
property to some company like kiss and

1250
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,720
gem fan

1251
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,200
so blle i know is one of the open source

1252
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,400
widely used

1253
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,720
protocol so i revitely use firmware for

1254
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,400
esc's use by all

1255
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,000
major drone pilots uh especially in the

1256
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,440
fpv community

1257
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,079
simon k is quite old and this is run

1258
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:26,640
simon k

1259
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,800
out of the box but new ess which we're

1260
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,760
using in drone racing uses bl heli or bl

1261
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,240
heli

1262
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,920
s or bla32 so a major difference in this

1263
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,760
firmware is the bl heli supports a

1264
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,599
regenerative braking that is

1265
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,040
uh for example in case of plane you want

1266
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,440
your motor to slow down very slowly

1267
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,240
uh because your plane can soar your

1268
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,040
plane can

1269
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,640
your plane has an airfoil which will

1270
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
keep it in air without

1271
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,160
any power so it can do some soaring it

1272
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,440
can do some gliding

1273
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,680
but in case of drone you need very

1274
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,280
precise control so you want

1275
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,520
your motor to come stop as soon as you

1276
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,040
cut the throttle so

1277
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,599
this uh facility is available in bl heli

1278
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,560
form where it's called

1279
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,720
active braking or regenerative braking

1280
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,319
so that's the major difference by the

1281
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,079
way no one use salmon can anymore it's

1282
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,880
quite old so make sure if you're buying

1283
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,280
esc for drone racing you go for bl heli

1284
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,079
s or ble32 these are the latest

1285
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,280
firmware for your esc's okay so moving

1286
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,839
ahead

1287
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,240
as i mentioned that the function of the

1288
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,000
esc is to control the motor

1289
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,680
speed and how much rpm esc wants to

1290
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,920
esc wants to rotate the motor that

1291
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,480
depends on the signal coming from the

1292
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,359
flight controller so there needs to be a

1293
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,720
protocol

1294
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,200
that is understood by flight controller

1295
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,920
as well as your esc so esc communicates

1296
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,240
with your receiver or flight controller

1297
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,680
to get desired value of motor rpm so as

1298
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,640
i mentioned

1299
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,800
esc can connect to a receiver or a

1300
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,680
flight controller

1301
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,200
and the receiver and flight controller

1302
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,119
will tell how much rpm

1303
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,599
esa should rotate the motor at and the

1304
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,640
communication can follow a standard so

1305
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,079
there are some industry standards

1306
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,079
already which

1307
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,160
which can follow by these communication

1308
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,359
so one of them is called a pwm or pulse

1309
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:15,680
with

1310
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,240
modulation so it's like pulses of on and

1311
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,280
off

1312
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
and based on how much pulse is on you

1313
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,400
get the duty cycle

1314
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,640
and things like that you don't need to

1315
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,240
get into very much details you just need

1316
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,319
to understand that there is one protocol

1317
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,160
that esc and flight controller both

1318
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,839
speak both should speak the same

1319
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,119
protocol and then only they can

1320
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,240
communicate

1321
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,960
uh so as the drone industry progresses

1322
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,359
as

1323
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,280
more faster and faster equipment start

1324
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,640
coming pwm gets outdated because it's uh

1325
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,040
very slow and the new protocol which

1326
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,200
came with one shot 125

1327
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,680
it's also very old now but when we

1328
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,200
started drone racing that is like the

1329
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,040
fastest protocol available then

1330
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,400
then came the one shot 42 and nowadays

1331
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,319
the most common protocol that everyone

1332
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,280
is using is

1333
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,319
either d shot or multi shot so

1334
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,319
uh difference between multi shot and d

1335
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,599
shot is so d shot

1336
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,960
is a digital protocol dots mean it is uh

1337
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,079
in form of zeros and one so flight

1338
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,000
controller sends zeros and ones to esc

1339
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,079
and ac understand how much rpm flight

1340
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,920
controller wants my motor to be

1341
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,400
revolved multishot is an analog protocol

1342
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,079
that means it is sending

1343
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,599
again the analog pulses and esc needs to

1344
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,880
calculate uh at the at esc and how much

1345
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,520
rpm it needs to be sent so d short is of

1346
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,000
course

1347
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,760
the fastest the digital the most

1348
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,200
reliable protocol

1349
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,520
but if you want another protocol and you

1350
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,040
want the fastest multi-shot design

1351
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,880
option and it uses something called dma

1352
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,119
or direct memory access so if you are

1353
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,640
someone from embedded background you

1354
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,640
know that dma is

1355
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,599
a peripheral that you can use to do a

1356
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,520
lot of data transaction in a very less

1357
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:51,920
time

1358
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,480
so these are all the protocols and uh if

1359
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,079
you're not programming yourself you just

1360
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,520
need to select the right protocol when

1361
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,560
you're programming your flight

1362
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,480
controller and your esc and

1363
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,720
you are good to go so this is a small

1364
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,720
comparison between the time so you can

1365
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,520
see that

1366
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,720
one shot 125 takes the largest uh take

1367
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,920
the maximum time

1368
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,319
so it takes around 250 millisecond for

1369
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,119
one

1370
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,880
one signal to come from flight

1371
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,920
controller to esc while dshot 1200 is

1372
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,480
the

1373
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,720
fastest protocol it takes very less time

1374
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,400
for communication so

1375
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,079
if you are buying an esc for drone

1376
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,000
racing for drone freestyle

1377
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,280
fpv go for dshot 1200 these are

1378
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,160
expensive but

1379
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,480
these are really worth the price so as i

1380
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,280
mentioned

1381
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,760
modernization has hit the drone after

1382
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,560
fpv

1383
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,200
has become mainstream and a lot of

1384
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,000
different uh

1385
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,800
companies they have did some r d and

1386
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,319
they come up with the new

1387
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,359
things in the esc and what modernization

1388
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,839
has hit the esc so first of all

1389
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,960
this ac used an 8-bit processor

1390
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,480
or a small avr kind of microcontroller

1391
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:56,800
which

1392
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,520
are generally 8-bit but the modern esc's

1393
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,000
they are using

1394
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,240
32-bit processor or arm processor these

1395
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,839
are very fast these are

1396
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,800
uh reliable have more space so 32-bit

1397
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,920
processors are generally

1398
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,560
way to go ahead and bl heli32 formula

1399
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,000
which i mentioned that is specifically

1400
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,119
for 32-bit

1401
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,240
esc's and i already mentioned that they

1402
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,280
support high speed precise timing so

1403
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,520
they support protocols like dshot 1200

1404
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,560
or multi shot

1405
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,280
these are very high speed and of course

1406
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,440
digital protocols are a way to go

1407
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,920
because if we are sending an analog

1408
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,000
signal like this so this is a pwm signal

1409
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,800
so if this

1410
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,319
signal is being sent by flight

1411
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,079
controller to this esc

1412
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,480
this esc needs to do calculation based

1413
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,280
on

1414
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,119
what is the on time what is the off time

1415
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,599
and then calculate how much rpm is being

1416
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:44,480
requested

1417
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,119
and this takes a lot of time this takes

1418
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,200
a lot of time uh doing the calculation

1419
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,079
and you are flying drone at 100 miles

1420
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,839
per hour you need very fast processing

1421
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:54,720
time so

1422
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,400
this is not a way to go the way to go is

1423
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,800
it digital you just tell your ac i want

1424
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,720
uh my motor to be at

1425
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,760
33 rpm and it understand

1426
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,440
quickly and it does so that is only

1427
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,280
possible if you are communicating over

1428
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,560
digital so

1429
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,800
both system are digital flat controller

1430
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,280
is digital uh esc is digital but why

1431
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,960
should they are speaking analog so yes

1432
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,880
digital protocols are the way to go

1433
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,640
as i already mentioned regenerative

1434
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,240
braking is there so

1435
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,839
uh so these esc has the capability to

1436
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:24,960
break the motor

1437
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,119
uh and i don't mean to break the motor i

1438
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,640
mean the braking uh like

1439
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,200
braking in your cars so these motors can

1440
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,160
stop the

1441
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,400
uh these es can stop the motor whenever

1442
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,599
is needed for

1443
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,880
uh from the user and things like that uh

1444
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,920
software reversing so initially in the

1445
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,040
days so this mod

1446
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,040
this es is having three wires motor has

1447
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,119
three wires uh if you connect these

1448
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,880
three wires to the motor it will rotate

1449
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,880
in one direction let's say clockwise

1450
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,400
if you want your motor to rotate

1451
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,240
anti-clockwise you need to switch any

1452
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,359
two wires

1453
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,160
and you need to enter interchange any

1454
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,119
two wires but

1455
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,359
nowadays you can directly plug these

1456
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,640
three wires to the motor

1457
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,200
and you can do reversing on the software

1458
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,559
and because of that

1459
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,280
you can do reversing in in between the

1460
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,880
flight so you can change the

1461
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,240
direction of motor in between the

1462
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,640
flights and that opens the door for

1463
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,640
something called 3d fpv

1464
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,880
where you can fly upside down and i'll

1465
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,720
show in some later

1466
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,200
chapters what is your 3d fpv but for now

1467
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,400
just understand that

1468
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,480
changing the motor direction uh using

1469
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,160
software is very much possible because

1470
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,319
of modern esc's

1471
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,160
uh there is something called calibration

1472
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,079
which is required so uh

1473
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,680
when we were talking about analog

1474
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,319
protocols uh esc needs to be calibrated

1475
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,480
esc should know what is the maximum

1476
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,920
range of throttle what is the minimum

1477
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,960
range of throttle

1478
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,640
uh that is something called calibration

1479
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,480
and when we move to the fret controller

1480
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,559
chapter we'll see how to calibrate the

1481
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,359
esc

1482
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,040
but because of digital protocols so

1483
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,640
there is no calibration needed

1484
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,960
just there are zeros and ones and you

1485
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,480
can get away with the calibration so

1486
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,480
that is a really good thing that has

1487
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,000
has happened so that is what i mentioned

1488
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,160
so before the software reversing was

1489
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,359
possible uh

1490
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,280
if you are if you are connected this esc

1491
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,559
to your motor and it's

1492
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,559
it's it's uh it's spinning in a

1493
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:11,920
clockwise direction and you want to

1494
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,359
reverse the direction

1495
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,119
then you need to change any two wires

1496
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,720
like this so you change any two wires

1497
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,640
and rotates anti-clockwise

1498
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,640
it is still true in these esc's but

1499
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,240
nowadays we generally prefer doing it

1500
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,839
with software so you just flick one

1501
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,280
switch on the software and you are good

1502
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:25,920
to go

1503
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,760
and the best part is you can do it in

1504
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,920
flight all right so moving ahead to the

1505
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,480
last

1506
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,640
part of this chapter that is about the

1507
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,319
battery so battery again is the

1508
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,720
powerhouse of your drone and this is the

1509
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,640
main source of the power

1510
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,880
uh for the entire drone system and

1511
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,119
that's how a typical battery looks like

1512
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,880
and i'll also show you the battery which

1513
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,359
i use

1514
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,240
on the overhead camera so this is a

1515
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,440
typical battery

1516
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,520
this has this lead which is the main

1517
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,480
lead and this has

1518
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,480
something called a balance port and

1519
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,839
we'll discuss about that

1520
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:00,000
so uh typically speaking in case of

1521
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,079
drones uh we used uh these kinds of

1522
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,040
batteries so

1523
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,400
lipo or lithium polymer uh li-ion

1524
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,480
or lithium ion life or lithium iron

1525
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,240
li hv or lithium high voltage so

1526
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,240
these are the common batteries which are

1527
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,000
used in drones so

1528
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,839
lithium polymer battery is the most

1529
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,520
common and most

1530
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,280
easily available battery for drones and

1531
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,559
it has a

1532
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,599
4.2 voltage each cell

1533
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,240
at uh full charge same with the lithium

1534
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:30,800
ion

1535
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,720
lithium ion is less preferred compared

1536
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,400
to lithium polymer but

1537
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,040
because it's quite expensive but it has

1538
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,559
same cell voltage

1539
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,800
then there are some new batteries which

1540
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,160
are being uh

1541
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,319
being being adopted in the drone

1542
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:45,200
community so

1543
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,920
li fe is another one it has some iron

1544
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,640
additives

1545
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,079
with lithium and a new battery which is

1546
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,480
getting mainstream is li hv or lithium

1547
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,240
high voltage and

1548
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,079
as the name suggests the per cell

1549
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,599
voltage at full charge is 4.35 volt and

1550
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,920
remember when i talked about the motor

1551
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,319
kv rating and the rpm depends on the

1552
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:07,520
voltage so

1553
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,599
imagine the lihi battery will give you

1554
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,640
more rpm

1555
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,640
a slightly more rpm because of the more

1556
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,079
voltage so

1557
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,440
this is are the common cells which are

1558
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,079
used to make

1559
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,119
batteries for drones and yes each cell

1560
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,440
is having some voltage and when you

1561
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,280
combine these cells together they form a

1562
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,319
battery

1563
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,800
so on the right you can see i think it's

1564
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,480
a three cell battery yes it's a three

1565
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,000
cell battery it's mentioned here and

1566
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,839
it's also mentioned 11.1 volt

1567
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,440
uh it's not the full charge voltage

1568
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,960
because at full charge it comes around

1569
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,160
12.5 volt

1570
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,040
and it has its own rating which we are

1571
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,559
gonna discuss shortly

1572
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,920
uh one thing before that it's a nanotech

1573
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,160
so nanotech is a new nanotechnology

1574
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,640
which is being coming in the battery and

1575
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,599
they are making battery uh more stable

1576
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:56,480
more reliable

1577
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,720
and i'm not expert of non-technology so

1578
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,160
i'm just

1579
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,960
leaving this term to you to research

1580
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,160
ahead so nanotech

1581
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,319
is another technology which is being

1582
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,760
added to these to make

1583
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,880
new batteries and drones so

1584
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,280
uh these are the battery rating so if i

1585
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,359
if you see on this battery it says

1586
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,720
1800 mah 75c so these are the common

1587
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,400
kinds of uh

1588
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,480
numbers which you see on a battery and

1589
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,920
uh similarly you see

1590
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,680
4s 2200 mah 60c

1591
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,920
so what exactly are this number so the

1592
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,119
first number

1593
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,000
uh the s rating it's the number of cells

1594
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,359
in a battery so

1595
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:40,559
in a 4s the number of cells is a 4

1596
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,480
cells battery so a 4s is a 4 cell

1597
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,319
battery a 6s

1598
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,440
is a 6 cell battery i know that it

1599
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,559
should be c but it's

1600
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,280
s in this case so uh make sure not to

1601
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,200
confuse with that because c is different

1602
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:53,680
so

1603
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,319
if i if i tell you 3s i have a 3s

1604
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,079
battery i mean to say that my battery

1605
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,599
has a 3 cell

1606
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,440
and each cell has a voltage so it gets

1607
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,079
it it will give a combined voltage of

1608
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,280
multiplied by three the second rating

1609
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,680
it's called the mah rating or this is

1610
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,680
also known as the battery capacity how

1611
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,440
much of the capacity is this battery is

1612
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,240
having so

1613
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,280
a 2200 mah battery has more capacity

1614
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,440
compared to that 1800 mah battery so

1615
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,359
this will give you more flight time

1616
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,960
so make sure to uh to check the image

1617
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,520
rating

1618
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,240
before buying a battery uh the last

1619
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:28,800
rating

1620
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,800
is called c rating or the discharge

1621
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,920
rating and

1622
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,520
this uh example here it's a 60c battery

1623
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,160
and this is a 75c battery in the photo

1624
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,359
so

1625
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,440
what is mean by the discharge rating and

1626
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,400
how it is

1627
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,480
important for us so it's a simple

1628
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,440
formula

1629
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,760
uh it tells what is the maximum current

1630
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,440
you can draw from a battery so in a

1631
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,640
simple formula

1632
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,280
maximum current draw equal to capacity

1633
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,559
into c rating

1634
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,880
so for example i have a 100 milliamp

1635
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,920
hour battery

1636
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,760
and it has a 100c uh discharge rating

1637
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,480
so if i 100 sorry 1000 mh means 1a so

1638
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,280
1000 divided by 1000 equal to 1 into 100

1639
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,240
is equal to 100

1640
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,599
amp so this battery can supply 100 amps

1641
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,920
maximum you cannot go beyond 100 amp

1642
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,040
before

1643
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,119
destroying the battery so 100 amp is

1644
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,800
quite much ampere but

1645
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,200
when we talk about drone in racing and

1646
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,000
freestyle you

1647
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,599
need a lot of amps so i at one point i

1648
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:28,960
have seen myself using

1649
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,520
more than 90 amps at a time so yes go

1650
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,599
for a battery with higher discharge rate

1651
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,000
75 c discharge rate is always preferred

1652
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,359
than 60 c discharge rate so

1653
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,400
you could be asking me that why

1654
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,559
cannot we go with a battery with very

1655
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,480
high capacity and very high discharge

1656
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,200
rates

1657
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,000
because more the capacity more flight

1658
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,200
time you will get

1659
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,040
but then i'll tell you everything in

1660
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,880
this drone is about finding that sweet

1661
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,319
spot and nothing comes

1662
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,160
free without trade-offs and what is the

1663
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,599
trade-off here is

1664
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,079
more the capacity your battery has more

1665
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,920
the c rating your battery has

1666
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,280
more fat it becomes more weight it has

1667
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,599
and of course it's it's going to be more

1668
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:10,480
more heavy

1669
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,880
and it will increase the overall weight

1670
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,680
of your

1671
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,640
drone and it may give you more flight

1672
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,359
time but

1673
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,359
it may also be adding more weight

1674
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,799
because of which you will getting

1675
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:23,200
less rpm and less pleasant flight

1676
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,640
experience and

1677
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,720
overall less flight time so again

1678
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,319
finding a sweet spot

1679
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,839
so uh talking about f3 drone racing

1680
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,799
these are the

1681
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,160
batteries which we generally fly uh for

1682
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,000
a five inch drone i am flying 1300 mah

1683
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,160
four cell uh 100c battery so this is my

1684
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,480
1300 mah 100c battery this is a four

1685
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,520
cell battery

1686
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,799
that means it has 4 cell and at full

1687
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:53,599
full charge it gives me around 16.5 volt

1688
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,319
so

1689
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,440
yes that is the battery which i'm using

1690
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,440
so uh yes i i want to discuss

1691
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,400
a couple of things more which i am not

1692
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,200
which i have not

1693
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,880
put in the slides so these are the

1694
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,559
battery connectors so

1695
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,480
uh this is the main battery connector

1696
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,319
which you connect with your drone

1697
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,400
and this is the connector which is used

1698
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,240
for charging the battery it's called the

1699
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,359
balance port

1700
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:20,559
so these batteries are quite unsafe if

1701
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,079
you do not handle it well because

1702
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,559
lithium is flammable and if i puncture

1703
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,319
this battery if i crash and this battery

1704
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,559
get punctured it will immediately

1705
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,720
catch fire so you need to make sure to

1706
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,480
treat this battery with utmost care

1707
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,040
because

1708
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,319
lithium is quite dangerous and flammable

1709
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,880
and even when you are charging and

1710
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,160
discharging the battery

1711
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,240
make sure to never discharge it beyond a

1712
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,280
certain limit

1713
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,200
make sure to never discharge the battery

1714
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,680
beyond 3.6 volt per cell

1715
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,680
otherwise it the cell will be damaged

1716
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,400
forever and you cannot recover the cell

1717
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,240
also when you are charging the battery

1718
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,680
make sure each cell

1719
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,079
is charging at the same rate so let's

1720
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,920
say this is a four cell battery and

1721
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,000
two of my cells are charging at a higher

1722
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,359
rate and two cells are starting at a

1723
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,160
lower rate

1724
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,920
this will create an imbalance and can

1725
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,640
cause fire that is why the balance port

1726
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,319
is provided and this port ensure

1727
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,839
that each and every cell is charged at a

1728
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:15,040
constant rate

1729
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,799
and make sure to always balance charge

1730
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,160
of battery and we'll talk

1731
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,079
about charging in the in the later in

1732
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,680
the later chapters

1733
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,760
but yes i wanted to show you that these

1734
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,280
two connectors and

1735
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,160
this is of course the male connector of

1736
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,440
the battery and

1737
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,920
this is the drone where you have the

1738
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,200
female connector and it connects

1739
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:33,920
together

1740
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,400
like this

1741
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,839
so uh just make sure that your drone has

1742
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,280
the same connector which are battery

1743
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,559
otherwise if your batteries have a

1744
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:45,440
different connector

1745
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,720
your drone is having different connector

1746
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,480
they cannot be

1747
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,200
connected together so yes that's the one

1748
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,960
thing i wanted to discuss about

1749
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,079
the safety and now let's talk about the

1750
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:56,880
connection

1751
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,599
uh the very last part of this chapter so

1752
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,359
we talked about motors we talked about

1753
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,040
esc we talked about batteries so how

1754
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,520
they are connected together so

1755
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,920
we know that motor has three wires it is

1756
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,000
connected to three wires of esc

1757
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,920
and esc is connected to the battery and

1758
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,599
connected to the flight controller so

1759
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:14,960
now let's forget about the flight

1760
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,400
controller for now and let's just see

1761
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,319
how this is connected so

1762
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,319
motor connects to the ac and ac connects

1763
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,240
to the battery that is

1764
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,640
the entire connection diagram and

1765
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,920
because we are

1766
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,760
talking about quadcopters we have four

1767
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,599
motors we have four esc

1768
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,920
but we only have one battery so we need

1769
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,680
to share the battery to all the four

1770
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,720
motors and

1771
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,720
this looks quite ugly if you do by

1772
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,079
soldering and connecting

1773
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,599
all together so that is why we use

1774
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,119
something called power distribution

1775
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,079
board

1776
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,720
this is nothing but a small pcb so over

1777
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,559
here i connect my battery

1778
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,880
and on this uh this battery is being

1779
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,000
distributed using

1780
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,200
this pcb and each esc can be connected

1781
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,079
to

1782
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,880
one particular port so this is a small

1783
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,160
component which you can use

1784
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,319
it's called power distribution board

1785
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,160
these days your flight controller also

1786
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,760
has a power distribution board

1787
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,240
itself so we'll talk about that in the

1788
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,280
next chapter

1789
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,280
but yes so this is used for distributing

1790
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,720
the power in your drone

1791
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,880
uh in case of hexacopter you'll have six

1792
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,160
so

1793
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,319
motors and six esc in case of octocopter

1794
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,079
you'll have eight motors and eight esc's

1795
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,359
and so on so

1796
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:22,000
uh this gets ugly but you can definitely

1797
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,599
do that you can definitely solder each

1798
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:24,720
other together

1799
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,160
but uh that's the use of power

1800
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,640
distribution board so

1801
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,760
just for you to see

1802
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,440
uh yes so there are different ways to

1803
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,640
connect to your

1804
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,000
motor to your esc so one way

1805
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,640
is there are something called bullet

1806
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,599
connectors

1807
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,559
like this so these are the bullet

1808
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,440
connectors so

1809
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,880
you can connect these bullet connectors

1810
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,880
to your esc bullet connectors but

1811
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,880
uh as i mentioned in the first chapter

1812
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,799
every every gram counts

1813
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,799
in case of drone and every grams adds to

1814
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,480
the weight so nowadays what people do is

1815
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,680
they they directly solder the motor

1816
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,960
wires to this esc

1817
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,440
so this esc comes naked from the

1818
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,200
manufacturer because they know that

1819
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,160
people no longer use bullet connector so

1820
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,480
we directly solder this esc

1821
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,319
uh sorry we directly soldered this motor

1822
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,079
wire to this esc to same

1823
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,480
to save some weight to save some grams

1824
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,280
so

1825
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,960
that's how the connection happens

1826
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,200
let me fit it into the frame yeah that's

1827
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,400
how the connection happened directly

1828
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,040
soldering it

1829
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,640
and yes uh four motors for esc's

1830
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,920
and one battery for quadcopter

1831
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,880
so yes that was all for this chapter we

1832
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,640
talked about battery we talked about

1833
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,559
esc's and we talked about

1834
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,000
the motors and uh i hope

1835
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,119
you get to learn something new today and

1836
