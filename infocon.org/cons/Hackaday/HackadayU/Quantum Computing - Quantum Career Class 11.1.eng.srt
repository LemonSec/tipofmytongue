[Music]

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,639
uh

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,120
today we're gonna do a career session

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,200
probably people who have seen the

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,119
posts today's comics is

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,520
about getting korea in in quantum

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,880
and uh i would let people do the q a

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,119
in a bit but i will walk you through

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,279
some of the slides that i have prepared

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,119
on this topic

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,520
for anyone who's joining the very first

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,120
time i always show this

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,239
to people that you can find all of the

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,040
past

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,239
recording for the class

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,800
in uh the hackaday

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,039
oh wait hear me clearly because

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,800
i wasn't using the right microphone can

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,559
you hear me now

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,719
yes yes yes and um

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,680
so i always let people know that this is

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,080
where you can find information

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,479
you can find all of the past recordings

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,920
and slides

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,080
and the official documentation that we

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,799
use is from

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,680
microsoft is our q sharp documentation

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,400
and we

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,799
have been using the cutters for training

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,680
on content

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
so if you missed any of the previous

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,840
classes these are the places you can go

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,560
to

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,000
and also um i'm very proud to uh

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,040
to announce that we were on forbes uh

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,040
the quantum team's work were featured

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,600
there

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,079
and our class was mentioned there also

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,520
including the the comics

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,520
so check it out this is um on forbes

41
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,439
october 18th on quantum just search for

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,200
you don't have to have this url just

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
search for the article there

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,399
by google press okay

45
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,439
and yeah thank you for

46
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,119
people who have been following the class

47
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,439
you have learned a lot of the

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,360
concepts that's needed for quantum

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,439
computing starting from

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,680
the superposition the fears and

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
entanglement concepts

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,959
as well as linear algebra and using q

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,360
sharp

54
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,400
to write algorithms these are the the

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
topics that we already have covered in

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,680
the past

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,280
i think 19 2018 classes

58
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,560
so now you may want to ask or even

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,120
before you started the class how

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,319
do i get a job in quantum and is it

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,480
something that you've been thinking

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,800
about maybe

63
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,959
you have been working on something for a

64
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,800
long time but quantum is something new

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,640
and you may be wondering

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,400
this might be the good field to enter

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,720
so we would look at some of the

68
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,000
career trajectories um examples

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,599
of what kinds of skills are needed in

70
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,519
quantum so this captures the path for

71
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,480
someone who start to learn quantum and

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,159
the topics that they need

73
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,519
to to get their hands on it but

74
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,519
we can also look at the existing

75
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,400
positions that we currently have in

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,440
quantum

77
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,480
and that's what the industry needs um

78
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,239
guess i would first show my own

79
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,560
trajectory this is definitely not

80
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,799
typical but just to give you some

81
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,599
background here this is kind of my

82
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,080
career

83
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,200
path professionally always been in

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,080
physics

85
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,319
and started with condensed matter

86
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,440
experiments

87
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,959
and started doing circuit designs

88
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,560
and did optoelectronics and photonics

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,879
but then i ended up coming back to

90
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,480
quantum where i started

91
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,760
uh as a undergrad in cambridge working

92
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,200
in the cavendish lab

93
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,280
so i'm not working on hardware anymore

94
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
but i'm working on quantum computing

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,680
on the education side but it's using a

96
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,560
lot of my past

97
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,959
experiences but all of these are

98
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,959
actually also contributing to

99
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,879
what i do now my site projects on arts

100
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,798
on fashion wearables those are actually

101
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,959
surprisingly very very useful and

102
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,120
helpful for what i'm doing right now

103
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
so this is how i found my balance

104
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,040
getting to do both science and art at

105
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,160
the same time

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,520
and quantum has this interface for me to

107
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,720
use my skills

108
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,560
in both areas but this is definitely not

109
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,199
typical

110
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,960
and you can definitely forge your own

111
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
career and you have your

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,400
your own skills and uniqueness

113
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,919
that you can leverage in uh presenting

114
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,479
yourself

115
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,680
as a unique uh person

116
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,560
to help the industry uh let's do let's

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,880
do this so i i have prepared these

118
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,400
characters i think it was quite

119
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,680
uh interesting that at the end of last

120
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,320
class

121
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
people were asking me the names of the

122
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,240
quantum characters

123
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,919
and i thought actually this would be a

124
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,000
good idea to even show you who they

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
are and where they sit on this landscape

126
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,560
let's start with peter um i'm gonna

127
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,840
actually do this

128
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,400
connection uh and people feel free to

129
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,840
chime in if you want to uh participate

130
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,360
in this

131
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,680
uh identification so peter is a

132
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,960
algorithm creator so he

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,240
discovers and proves

134
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
the power of quantum computing and

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
he comes up with new ideas that could

136
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,639
use quantum computers

137
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,479
for and creates events an algorithm that

138
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,000
solves that particular

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,319
problem we need a lot of people like

140
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,120
that

141
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,840
and especially that you have seen in

142
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,880
previous classes

143
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
there are algorithms that will be very

144
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,080
useful

145
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,880
they require a lot of qubits but they're

146
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,199
also

147
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,680
things that we can already start doing

148
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
with a small number of qubits

149
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
trying to learn but in between we also

150
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,120
need a lot of

151
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,639
effort to find applications of quantum

152
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,240
computing that can

153
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,080
start to help us do work

154
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,479
so people who come up with algorithms

155
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,440
may come from a math or physics

156
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,479
background

157
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,479
and i also want to mention is not

158
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,080
definitely

159
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,919
all of these characters have their

160
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,759
different backgrounds you don't have to

161
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,520
have a phd in physics

162
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,560
to contribute to quantum so peter might

163
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
have a phd

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,080
in in math or physics and

165
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
he is particularly helpful in coming up

166
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,960
with new algorithms and helping people

167
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,919
apply and do interesting things so

168
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,120
he's gonna sit here

169
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:17,840
let me change this style

170
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,560
but then there are a lot of us

171
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,360
a lot of programmers and developers in

172
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,639
quantum

173
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,840
that they use the algorithms

174
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,039
or they develop applications

175
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,319
utilizing those algorithms and they may

176
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,400
also come up with new algorithms

177
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,360
to write programs to solve particular

178
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,240
problems

179
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,440
so in quantum right now we have

180
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,639
um things like schwarz algorithm

181
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,800
group versus algorithm that are purely

182
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,840
quantum

183
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,960
and there are also problems like

184
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,919
chemistry simulation material simulation

185
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:00,479
that is

186
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,960
also purely quantum that you need

187
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,400
quantum computers to

188
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,960
to run but there are also problems like

189
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,720
inspire quantum inspired optimization

190
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,840
that's using quantum ideas but applying

191
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,560
to

192
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,319
classical problems so those can also be

193
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,800
that kind of quantum algorithm that that

194
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,680
could help us

195
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,199
even though they are they may be

196
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,120
classical but is

197
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,599
using some quantum ideas we have a lot

198
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,560
of programmers

199
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,039
they may come from software engineering

200
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,000
background

201
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,679
and they might not have learned quantum

202
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,120
at all in their

203
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,679
formal education but then they pick it

204
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,159
up

205
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,519
along the way so they

206
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,959
i will also put them over here

207
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,240
in this algorithm category

208
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,399
um but we also have people we need that

209
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,839
need to run like layers of

210
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,360
the languages on hardware we need to

211
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,399
actually build

212
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,640
both the hardware and software stack

213
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,600
that's that will be able to use the

214
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,440
actual hardware so i would also

215
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,880
connect them there uh of course they

216
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,360
they

217
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,760
already understand the basics linear

218
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,040
algebra and all these

219
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,399
concepts and they are

220
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,800
writing these uh things on maybe

221
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,080
q sharp they may come up with new uh

222
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,360
they might be language uh creators as

223
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,680
well

224
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
they come up with the new language and

225
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,160
they developed that um

226
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,279
we also have people like james here

227
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,360
who is a researcher so here research

228
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,240
research i particularly mean like

229
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,760
natural sciences

230
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,600
i mentioned classical uh sorry quantum

231
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,560
simulations like chemistry material

232
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,600
science

233
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,680
biological simulations or physics

234
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,440
simulations

235
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
classical computers can run into

236
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
limitations

237
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,399
and we want to use perhaps quantum ways

238
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,680
to simulate them

239
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,839
and understand how to come up with new

240
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,000
materials so james is in

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,120
the research area also

242
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,040
needing the algorithms

243
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,959
and they also help us

244
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,160
come up with ideas of

245
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,600
doing hardware making more types of

246
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,720
scalable qubits their research can also

247
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,040
contribute to that

248
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,640
we have albert who is an educator

249
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,560
and what they're very good at is

250
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,839
explaining concepts scientific concepts

251
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,680
that are that could seem intimidating to

252
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,000
people

253
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,560
who just start but then they have a very

254
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,079
good grasp of it

255
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,240
and they can explain things in a very

256
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,920
accessible way

257
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,680
without making it just trivial and not

258
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,240
teaching

259
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,680
people anything hyping it so

260
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,480
we definitely in the new field of

261
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,399
quantum computing we need people like

262
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,560
that

263
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,399
then as you see that this is a

264
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,680
emerging field we need a lot of people

265
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,320
who's

266
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,120
able to train more people to understand

267
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
it

268
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,560
otherwise we wouldn't have the adoption

269
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
from industry

270
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,680
or we wouldn't have a new

271
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,320
new learners coming in being able to

272
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,120
contribute

273
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,399
to the next generation of

274
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,399
workforce so a role like

275
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,399
albert is also very important and they

276
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,440
typically can sit

277
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,000
over here but they're really spanning

278
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,760
all these areas because they need to

279
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,639
communicate

280
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,680
all the ideas that's involved

281
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,600
and but they need to explain very well i

282
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,839
just keep in mind that this line will go

283
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,720
through

284
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
this cable that goes all the way

285
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,639
but they will need to explain the basic

286
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,639
concepts and theory

287
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,360
um they can come from any i would say

288
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,720
steam background

289
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,920
so they need the engineering and science

290
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,680
uh understanding but having the skills

291
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,040
to communicate

292
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,880
and doing art is extremely

293
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,959
helpful there they know how to

294
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,880
communicate and talk to

295
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,880
the public and uh we need people like

296
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,519
ada

297
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,480
who is the early adopter so without

298
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,639
early adopters any technology without

299
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,120
early

300
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,560
adopters not going to scale and they

301
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,279
typically can be business decision

302
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,800
makers

303
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
they don't have to be an expert in

304
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,920
quantum computing

305
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,800
but they have the skill to understand it

306
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,600
they

307
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,279
have a good idea of what this technology

308
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,079
is about

309
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,160
and they are able to identify what

310
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,360
problems in their

311
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,839
existing industry might be able to

312
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,839
utilize

313
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,839
quantum computing so

314
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,399
these people need to self train

315
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,600
definitely

316
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,959
and they need to have a good idea

317
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,279
of what problems are not even

318
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,399
applicable with quantum computing

319
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,320
because there are so much hype and

320
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
everyone

321
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
may think that oh quantum computer is

322
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,079
going to replace classical computer but

323
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,480
we have seen that's not true so they

324
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,600
need to identify

325
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,800
what are the problems so

326
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,160
uh we of course have a lot of learners

327
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,240
very passionate and curious about

328
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
quantum computing

329
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,720
and their passion would drive them to

330
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,040
dig

331
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,399
deeper to to really

332
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
discover all the the new ideas

333
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,160
in quantum and really get their hands

334
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
dirty on working on quantum

335
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,440
and they will be able to join us as the

336
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,079
next generation of quantum workforce

337
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,279
so they would um not just

338
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,360
uh learn a little bit and

339
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
learn something shallow and then leave

340
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,839
but they would be able to grasp all of

341
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:32,720
these

342
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,639
through their first personal exploration

343
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,079
so they for sure will start from the

344
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,360
basics but of course they gonna

345
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,800
they need to go all the way

346
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,839
to be able to

347
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,199
really do this professionally but

348
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,959
they can come from any background as

349
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,399
long as they have

350
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,920
the ability and the drive to learn

351
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,720
so they don't have to have any phd in

352
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,440
any of the

353
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,079
fields but if they want to learn they

354
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,760
can do it

355
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,240
and richard is

356
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,279
a hardware maker is very broadly

357
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,320
speaking maker

358
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,920
they can be designers it can be

359
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,600
engineers

360
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,720
they would need to understand the

361
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,160
physics the of the quantum

362
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,199
system that they're building doesn't

363
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,480
matter which

364
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,600
hardware that they choose to make can be

365
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
topological quantum computer

366
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,440
can be the

367
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,880
lc circuit uh

368
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:46,639
semiconductor lc circuits

369
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,839
could be trapped irons

370
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,959
they typically would need physics

371
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,320
or electrical engineering or material

372
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,759
science background

373
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,160
so if you are interested in hardware

374
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,199
then this would be some

375
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,639
professional training that you would

376
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,399
need to understand

377
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,920
the hardware aspects

378
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,920
and be able to build the systems

379
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,000
so that's there it's getting a little

380
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,759
crowded

381
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,839
i'll delete this in a bit

382
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,800
so but then as you can see we have

383
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,680
people

384
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,720
coming to different areas uh with

385
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,399
different backgrounds

386
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,160
it doesn't mean that uh if if you are

387
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,680
a software person having understanding

388
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,519
of the hardware is definitely helpful

389
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,199
but you don't have to

390
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,759
have the same training as richard

391
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,880
whereas richard is very good at hardware

392
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,199
having software understanding and being

393
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,240
able to

394
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,560
grasp what the software developers are

395
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,440
developing

396
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,360
is very helpful but they don't

397
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,519
necessarily need to come from a software

398
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,360
engineering background

399
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,559
so we need a lot of interdisciplinary

400
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,640
cross-section so

401
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,640
as a thing out of the box person

402
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,000
you can be anywhere you can assess

403
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,199
your own background and know what you

404
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,000
want to go

405
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
where where you want to go and knowing

406
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,199
that this is

407
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,720
what you need you would drive yourself

408
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,160
from the basics to the professional

409
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,840
and this will be a

410
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,880
certificate i will give out to people uh

411
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,919
so i have a challenge i just posted

412
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,200
that on this picture here

413
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,320
you should find where

414
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,440
any of the character is was introduced

415
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,799
in past classes in the past

416
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,760
pages uh if you go through the comics

417
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,600
you will be able to find

418
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,880
where they were introduced and then find

419
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,200
the video recording of that particular

420
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,240
class

421
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,440
if you haven't watched it go watch it

422
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
and then write down briefly what you

423
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,799
have learned

424
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,160
in that class post that on

425
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,360
the comment section hack a day or

426
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,480
do a tweet linkedin and uh

427
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,520
instagram whatever way you want but tag

428
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,720
tag me and tag microsoft quantum

429
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,640
oh and hashtag q sharp and you will get

430
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,280
this

431
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
out of the box thinker but that's not

432
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,200
the goal the goal is that you actually

433
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,160
learn something

434
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,480
so this will be a really fun activity

435
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,799
for you

436
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,440
later and the other thing i want to

437
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:43,919
mention

438
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,039
is contributing i get a lot of questions

439
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,440
from people who want to apply for jobs

440
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,960
in quantum and asking how what kind of

441
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,080
skills they need

442
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,720
i have explained here you can come from

443
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,960
all kinds of backgrounds

444
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,559
but a very important thing is to show

445
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,000
that you have

446
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,039
the passion the drive and the ability to

447
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,080
do quantum

448
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,799
and the very helpful place for you to do

449
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,280
that

450
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,679
is actually contributing to all of our

451
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,080
open source

452
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,120
libraries uh repositories

453
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,280
and uh katas all of these are

454
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,760
already available for anyone to learn

455
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,600
from and play with

456
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,960
uh and here are a lot of links but

457
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
where do you find it you can actually

458
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,320
find all of these on

459
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,480
the microsoft quantum page if people

460
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,320
need i can show you later in the

461
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,679
on the browser but all of these

462
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,480
just pick whichever that's helpful for

463
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,880
you

464
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,679
start contributing and by the time

465
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,000
you're applying for a job

466
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,559
in the interview or in the in your

467
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,720
resume you can even list that you have

468
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,760
done this and that's your

469
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,880
very first entrance to prove

470
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,799
that you you not only are

471
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,080
passionate about quantum computing you

472
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,480
actually done something this is a great

473
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,640
way for you to demonstrate

474
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,760
um so don't wait for yeah

475
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,000
that's that's wonderful i'm i'm a

476
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,360
project manager

477
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,159
so where where i was wondering and we

478
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,240
have a project in the making

479
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,159
uh where we want to establish some

480
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,240
protocols and and some best practices

481
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,360
with with quantum

482
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,679
uh preferably bouncing bouncing them off

483
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,559
you

484
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,559
uh where would we put that would that go

485
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,960
in the last item

486
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,720
no that would not be the right place uh

487
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,000
i think the best way is to once you have

488
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,200
written that you have a website or

489
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,240
something

490
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,559
that captures what you are doing you can

491
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,919
email us

492
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,880
and i think a good thing that you should

493
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,280
also

494
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,480
cross-check is to study

495
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,320
existing efforts from what you just said

496
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,280
there are a lot of programs there are a

497
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,240
lot of

498
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,600
activities meetups that's doing

499
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,480
quantum they're doing their own things

500
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:16,799
but

501
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,000
there are so many of them um what is the

502
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,840
special thing that you are doing and can

503
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,880
you collaborate with

504
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,159
existing resources that's

505
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,960
that have the same goal i think coming

506
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,080
together

507
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,280
working collaboratively will be a key

508
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,520
for you yes and that's exactly what

509
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,559
we're doing but

510
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,039
there's still the question of uh you're

511
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:39,760
suggesting

512
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,440
here's where you can collaborate here

513
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,120
where we can put in there's one two

514
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,960
three four five six seven

515
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,320
areas i i don't see a logical place uh

516
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,799
for us to list our website with that

517
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,919
collaboration

518
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,840
i'm happy with just sharing it with you

519
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,360
once we're ready and then you can advise

520
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
me later privately

521
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,559
sure that how that can work

522
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,200
um so i yeah i don't know what's what

523
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,559
are you you are doing

524
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,760
uh if it's not an official microsoft

525
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,440
project then uh we have to

526
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,159
to look how we can support you sure i

527
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,360
appreciate that and i can take that up

528
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,520
with microsoft canada as as well

529
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,000
but thank you that's my question yeah

530
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,400
yeah this is really for people's

531
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,280
project sorry i mean david could also

532
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,679
you know start getting a project on that

533
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,120
matter and therefore

534
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,600
that github then can be put up on a

535
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,240
publix

536
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
or you can i mean it will be picked up

537
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,440
anyway by the

538
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,120
search engines and stuff so i think

539
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,559
github could be a great place for that

540
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,120
because

541
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,080
then it becomes more collaborative yeah

542
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,320
if it's something that you can present

543
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,840
in the

544
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,960
in the way of a github repo then by all

545
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,679
means do that

546
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,039
yeah yeah i right now don't know what uh

547
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,880
kind of program you're you're building

548
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,159
so keep keep github in mind for sure

549
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,320
uh yeah and then um here is a place

550
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,480
if you haven't put in your

551
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,440
opinions your

552
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,240
your preferences in this survey go do

553
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,200
that this is our microsoft

554
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,360
development kit and here is a survey

555
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,320
is an opportunity for you to let us know

556
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,039
what

557
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,360
types of content that you want to do

558
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,520
that you want to learn

559
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,640
so it would be a great engagement

560
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,440
and for us to develop the content that

561
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,559
would be useful for you later too

562
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,520
so um and then quick announcement before

563
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
we start the

564
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,960
q a is next class i'm

565
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,400
going to take a day off from this

566
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
class because i have a special project

567
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
going on i really need the time for

568
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,760
so uh please go back to

569
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,080
past classes if you missed any and

570
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,240
give you time to catch up so we would

571
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,919
come back

572
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,559
the week after and i would talk about

573
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,760
something

574
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,880
about uh hardware that that that

575
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
was the only box that i hadn't

576
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,480
highlighted but

577
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,000
we did do one class existing

578
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,919
presentation of different kinds of

579
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,799
hardware so

580
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,799
i think i will have some focus on

581
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,240
particular hardware

582
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
so not all of them if you need an

583
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,760
overview please go back to

584
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,200
that class to take an overview

585
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,000
um before you come to this class next

586
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,279
time

587
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,840
that's what i prepare to present and i

588
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,080
can open up the floor if people

589
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,600
want to ask questions about getting

590
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,520
started in korea in quantum

591
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,919
hi kitty i have a question and

592
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,799
a slight addition maybe in that career

593
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,880
path if that's okay may i

594
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,400
yeah sure yeah um so um the question

595
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,039
that i have

596
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,960
is um with regards to the azure quantum

597
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,159
um in the future would that

598
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,279
also allow other um

599
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,440
other programs to also run which are

600
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,679
non-microsoft so for example

601
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,720
ibm q for example or honeywell writing

602
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,400
their own

603
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,159
you know they're also writing their own

604
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,520
algorithm for example

605
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,840
in their own language and so would that

606
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,919
open up to other vendors as well

607
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,520
a kind of vendor neutrality we already

608
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,679
are working well i know honeywell is

609
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,720
there

610
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,640
we already work with uh honeywell rnq

611
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,679
uh one qubit and a lot of partners

612
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,080
so that's already there but what about

613
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,440
ibm

614
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,240
um we'll see i will see what happens but

615
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,279
it's something that will

616
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,679
that will come as in future however it

617
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,520
happens is that right

618
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,080
that would in the future we'll have to

619
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,880
wait and see

620
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,240
i can't give you the answer now right

621
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,400
okay and the other two addition i would

622
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,200
say i mean from the commercial side

623
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,080
in that picture i think you could have a

624
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,240
consultant who basically

625
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,159
you know proposes a quantum solution to

626
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,200
you know academia or industry or

627
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,600
department or whatever i think somebody

628
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,880
who has a

629
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,240
who's a great um you know

630
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,080
good at communicating understands the

631
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,120
quantum but is not really hands-on

632
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,919
so that person could become a consultant

633
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,760
and then that person could also work

634
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,400
with

635
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,679
numerous quantum specialists to deliver

636
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,760
a project for example would you say that

637
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
could be a career path as well

638
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,080
that could be yeah i would i would think

639
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,600
so

640
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,320
there are a lot of peripherals for sure

641
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,200
also

642
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,320
stealth quantum cells for example

643
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,840
or quantum optimizers people who are

644
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,559
good at

645
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,000
optimization optimization quantum

646
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,279
cyber security for example yeah

647
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,240
quantum military radar and all that for

648
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,200
sure

649
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,760
yes it's like everything else yeah yeah

650
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,799
all right thanks

651
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,360
that's all thank you

652
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,320
i i i can i can add uh to what you what

653
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,600
you mentioned there

654
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,200
uh summit the uh the cto of

655
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,559
of uh ibm in the uk uh who's

656
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,320
i think the head cheerleader for their

657
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
ibm q2 hardware

658
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,960
expressed interest to pledge the future

659
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,520
of

660
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,640
the ibm q to be part of our uh

661
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,279
quantum computing to solve fusion

662
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,399
project

663
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,600
so once uh i think the projects may

664
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,159
pull them all together and uh once i

665
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,279
follow kitty's

666
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,159
uh instructions and i'll uh microsoft

667
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,840
canada is helping us at the moment

668
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,120
with this project they uh

669
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,440
uh i i believe we'll be they'll be

670
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,240
pulling them all

671
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,440
all together uh and as he mentioned

672
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,559
there are uh many quantum associations

673
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,840
one of which is called association

674
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
quantum another toronto-based

675
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,000
quantum meetup uh which again pulls in

676
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,120
in projects so i i see us all

677
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,360
forming around uh kitty's quantum

678
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,799
computer for comics

679
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,919
uh as an approach uh kitty the approach

680
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:28,960
that you use here is

681
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,320
is is both inspiring uh and friendly and

682
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,440
educational

683
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,039
so that's that's where uh my people

684
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,120
and and i all want to come with you

685
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,480
and what what i'd love to do is also try

686
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,520
and figure out

687
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,399
uh where the where the music and fashion

688
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,039
and

689
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,159
uh the arts performing arts can

690
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,440
can be part of this in that i believe

691
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:55,840
that

692
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,399
we're at an inflection point in history

693
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,600
where

694
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,799
children are aware of computers in grade

695
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,440
school they're

696
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,559
learning how to program

697
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,240
the hello world quantum computer

698
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,120
project or algorithm is we're looking to

699
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,960
teach that to as young as possible

700
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,720
and kitty that's where you're you're an

701
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,159
inspiration

702
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,360
uh in particular coming back summit

703
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,200
uh i just wanted to mention very

704
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,480
exciting uh where you

705
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,840
you mentioned some of the military

706
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,679
hardware uh we always want quantum

707
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,880
computing to be used for

708
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,919
for good but i i appreciate

709
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,000
your mention of that uh part of our

710
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,080
contribution is a friend of mine

711
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,399
at the university of waterloo uh a

712
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,279
co-founder

713
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,399
of their quantum institute uh has

714
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,000
uh some quantum projects involving

715
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,440
security with uh satellites

716
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,679
so we'll we'll pull all that together a

717
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,919
little github github and i'm and i'm i'm

718
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,360
looking to document them with

719
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,480
with kitty's uh uh kitties

720
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,520
uh the comic kitties to

721
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,760
relate the different aspects of where

722
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,559
the project

723
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,039
came came together which i think will

724
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,159
inspire the young

725
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,159
as well as bring in the technical

726
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,279
geniuses

727
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,840
uh maybe half of the world are on this

728
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,360
meetup right now we just haven't talked

729
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,520
to them yet

730
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,840
right yeah thank you i will also add

731
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,679
that is

732
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,640
very good to start the discussion about

733
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,440
ethical

734
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,720
quantum computing early and

735
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,480
there are applications that we need we

736
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,000
should be very careful for

737
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,399
because technology can be used for good

738
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,760
and evil

739
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,880
um but i do i really want to uh

740
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,000
because today is q a for korea

741
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,799
and i would love to give people the

742
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,159
opportunity if they

743
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,039
have any questions about their own or

744
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,159
their friends

745
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,279
experience and what type of jobs are out

746
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,000
there

747
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,360
so if people want to ask that feel free

748
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,679
to unmute or post in the chat

749
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,919
yeah thank you android developer and i

750
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,200
see a

751
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
question from todd as well i'll answer

752
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,799
that first

753
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,519
is it better to target the open source

754
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,600
projects or work towards

755
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,240
functional applications at this point

756
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,480
build a tool to add to the libraries

757
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,640
already in existence or work on a new

758
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,320
application area for the technology

759
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,600
both really go for it anything that's

760
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,720
filling any gap is going to be very

761
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,600
helpful for the whole field building

762
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,159
adding things to library definitely

763
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,399
you should go through that that would

764
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,440
help you learn

765
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,200
a lot of the existing development but

766
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,440
you also find a lot of bugs and

767
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,880
problems and you come in and help

768
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,640
everyone build new applications

769
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,760
definitely because

770
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,720
we need a lot more applications for

771
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,320
quantum computing we're just

772
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,039
developing this new generation of

773
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,559
computation

774
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,760
and a lot of unknowns

775
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,159
i heard a lot about the analogy between

776
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,200
this and

777
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,679
when laser was first invented because

778
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,840
the inventor never had would have

779
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,519
thought that all these applications for

780
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,159
lasers

781
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,519
now that we do so same goes with

782
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,640
quantum computing um android developer

783
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,000
has a question

784
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,080
they have a bachelor of science

785
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,519
in data science and computing um

786
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,919
the question is i have entered royal

787
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,279
astronomical society poster exhibition

788
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,559
congrats

789
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,960
notice there is a lot of logic operators

790
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,000
used in my comics

791
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,440
you mean the the gates the circuits

792
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,640
should i clearly explain such areas

793
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,240
using logic in my poster entry

794
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,279
are you doing a quantum computing poster

795
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,679
and are you trying to explain a

796
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,240
algorithm

797
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,600
i'm wondering what's uh yeah okay

798
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,320
um so it's really up to you whichever

799
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,519
way you think is

800
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,399
most easy to convey because quantum

801
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,360
circuit

802
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,799
to represent algorithm is its own

803
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,720
thing is a representation people do have

804
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,919
to learn

805
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,320
so for people who have never learned

806
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
what quantum circuits are if they look

807
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,240
at it the first time they may not be

808
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,919
able to really grasp and understand it

809
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,840
that's why we actually spent some time

810
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,360
in the class explaining what

811
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,960
how circuit is is written and also for

812
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,640
circuits you can't really scale

813
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,159
if you have a really big algorithm

814
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,399
the circuit is only going to be helpful

815
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,240
with small number of qubits

816
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,919
and once you know how circuits work

817
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,279
so depends if you can explain it

818
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,679
with words or with other types of

819
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:04,480
graphics

820
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,760
that's clearer for your audience go for

821
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,800
it

822
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,199
if you think they already understand

823
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:11,918
qubits

824
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,320
sorry gate logic circuits then

825
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,839
you can do that too

826
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,040
any other question yeah thanks

827
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,359
doesn't have to be your own experience

828
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,040
you can ask for your friends because

829
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
i've been getting a lot of

830
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,320
requests so might as well do a session

831
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,520
like this yeah good luck

832
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,440
kitty i have a i have a question yeah

833
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
at york university which is pulling

834
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,719
together all the universities we're

835
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,440
looking at

836
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,320
deploying the campus itself as a type of

837
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,879
quantum

838
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,320
sensor this has to do with the

839
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,880
environmental spin part of our project

840
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,599
of with the environment the uh the

841
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,960
theory that we have going

842
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,160
is that an energy information management

843
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,880
system

844
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,599
uh based on the energy grid uh with a

845
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,320
scada

846
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,599
uh a uh a supervisor control

847
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,560
and data system if we have enough iot

848
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,680
devices

849
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
the challenges i was talking to to tell

850
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,200
us that's one of our telcos just before

851
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,400
this call

852
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,079
if we have enough iot devices to

853
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,920
actually be useful to have

854
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
uh fine granularity in terms of

855
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,160
atmospheric interference for example

856
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,359
or atmospheric anomalies whether they're

857
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,560
all health related the uh we're thinking

858
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,400
we'd be overwhelmed by

859
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,520
a the data that we wouldn't be able to

860
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,359
compute it in real time fast enough and

861
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,040
for what we're looking for the anomalies

862
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,640
that would be issues

863
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,400
this is where quantum computers is

864
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,839
natural fit i

865
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,560
i can't in this moment figure out uh

866
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,760
what the logical path

867
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,960
would be but i instinctively realized

868
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,359
that through the the kiddie diagram of

869
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,720
quantum computing

870
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,010
uh careers that the path would unfold

871
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,880
[Music]

872
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,160
do you do any of the roles that you just

873
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,480
spoke of for an ideal application both

874
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,760
hardware and software

875
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,720
com come to mind

876
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,480
i don't quite understand the problem

877
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
we're trying to solve right now whether

878
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,440
or not it's applicable with quantum

879
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,160
computing

880
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,800
but i think i think the advice i would

881
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,359
give

882
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,720
is if you haven't

883
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,000
done previous classes for understanding

884
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,960
the concept

885
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,079
of quantum computing and where they are

886
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,119
definitely go to those classes

887
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,880
it doesn't have to be from from this

888
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,240
class you can

889
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,440
read about superposition interference

890
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
and entanglement

891
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,079
and try some algorithms yourself

892
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,200
and have a better idea of

893
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,079
what quantum computing is used for for

894
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:00,480
thanks

895
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,800
well we've done that actually and uh the

896
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,560
the challenge is the the

897
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,920
the harvard phd uh has a bottleneck

898
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,359
with the current efficiencies of

899
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,520
supercomputers so this is where we need

900
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,200
additional computing power so this is

901
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,440
where quantum computers are natural fit

902
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,880
uh so it becomes a a matter of

903
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,920
the uh the algorithms i'm familiar with

904
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,839
the algorithm that would be required for

905
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:24,640
that

906
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,200
the uh we may need a hardware play here

907
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,920
we're not

908
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,760
sure about so i think what we'll do is

909
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,760
i'll i'll i'll take this offline i'll

910
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,320
talk to my harvard mit guy

911
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,480
we're going to formulate what we believe

912
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,920
is the is the

913
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,720
uh is the issue uh where the classical

914
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,440
requirement

915
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,119
uh ends where we think the quantum

916
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,040
starts and this is where we think it's

917
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,480
more than just a programming

918
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,200
uh by looking at your your diagram it

919
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,400
occurred to me that

920
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,240
we have to be open to a a more of an

921
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,280
interdisciplinary approach

922
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
uh where we're looking at hardware that

923
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,480
may not exist yet

924
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,320
for our application it's you know it's a

925
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,520
seven year projector so

926
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,200
i recommend you to connect offline uh

927
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,320
and if you want to bounce off ideas uh i

928
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,599
would recommend

929
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,359
when the actual quantum becomes public

930
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,680
uh you can try it on actual hardware

931
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,280
so to formulate your problem

932
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,839
with a quantum solution

933
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,079
so that's that's what i would recommend

934
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,760
you do i appreciate well what we're

935
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,040
doing is we're going to create in q

936
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,839
sharp first

937
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,400
uh because q sharp is is operates off a

938
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,079
quantum simulated hardware

939
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,320
and that way we're we don't have to wait

940
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,079
for the hardware to show up and

941
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,480
it's just a matter of extending the the

942
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,079
computational ability beyond

943
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,240
our current classical limitations so

944
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,599
what i uh i do

945
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,480
i do have the the uh support from the

946
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,560
the ibm uh

947
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,200
uh quantum q guy that when it shows up

948
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,079
it's there we're just trying to

949
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,560
anticipate and and get it ready for

950
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,640
where we when we expect the hardware to

951
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,760
show up

952
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,480
um and uh also a reminder that the the

953
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,320
meeting is being recorded

954
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,720
uh so if there's any confidential

955
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,520
information

956
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,599
you shouldn't share because this or let

957
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:20,640
me know if you

958
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,040
uh okay with sharing because this video

959
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,800
is going to go on on youtube

960
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
afterwards well i appreciate this is

961
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,400
this was information that was

962
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,200
that was shared on a similar meetup and

963
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,119
it was a public declaration so i do

964
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,240
appreciate that

965
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,640
yeah i have a question from sb

966
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,200
they're asking about sales and

967
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,960
consulting or business side of

968
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,560
technology

969
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,040
most of the meetups are very technical

970
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,280
and that's good but how would one work

971
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,800
in future as

972
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,160
a quantum computer pre-sales engineer

973
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,119
or architecture consultant oh yeah

974
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,800
that's uh that's a good question

975
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,760
um yeah a lot of the examples that i

976
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,200
gave are

977
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,240
technical roles uh but there's the early

978
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,880
adopter

979
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,200
that i included here that is

980
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,560
relating to business and consulting so

981
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,800
that i would i would recommend the same

982
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,480
thing is

983
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,680
they need to be at least have some basic

984
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,440
understanding of how quantum computing

985
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,240
works

986
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,240
and then be able to tell that

987
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,280
what type of problems is used for

988
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,920
using quantum computing so it's the same

989
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,720
that

990
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,000
you will have to at least know these

991
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,280
areas to be uh able to

992
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,560
move forward with your applications

993
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,160
so uh yeah there there are a lot of

994
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,440
people out there doing

995
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,800
quantum business and

996
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,240
early business development is also very

997
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,520
important for this field

998
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,480
uh is there scenarios where quantum

999
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,760
computing should not be used

1000
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,200
plenty because uh what classical

1001
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,359
computers can already do very very well

1002
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,319
you don't have to

1003
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,400
use quantum computers it's not a

1004
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,359
replacement

1005
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,880
you it's not that

1006
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,680
if your quantum computer if your classic

1007
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,640
computer can

1008
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,800
already be used to drive an airplane you

1009
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,680
don't have to

1010
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,000
use a quantum computer to do that you

1011
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,800
could but

1012
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,240
why would you because you don't want to

1013
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,160
overkill

1014
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,599
so i think finding the problems quantum

1015
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,560
computers

1016
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,240
can solve is more urgent

1017
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,160
taught as in the field as it sits right

1018
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,520
now

1019
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,000
is the work more focused on design

1020
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,119
algorithm creation

1021
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,440
or more towards development and creation

1022
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,680
of code to utilize

1023
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,839
to get an idea of the day-to-day for a

1024
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:58,880
developer it's

1025
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,720
all of them really we have developers in

1026
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,839
the actual q sharp language and

1027
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,680
we have developers who build algorithms

1028
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,079
who write online and work with customers

1029
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,800
to come up with solutions

1030
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,720
helping them expressing their problems

1031
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,560
into quantum

1032
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,200
representations we also have developers

1033
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
who work on the compilers

1034
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,560
because it's a language you need a

1035
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,200
compiler for computation

1036
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,480
we have developers who work on the

1037
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,040
integration of the language with

1038
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,960
particular hardware

1039
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
different kinds of hardware so q sharp

1040
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,119
is a

1041
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,319
language that runs with classical

1042
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,440
language as well and is got

1043
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,280
great interoperability so

1044
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,400
we intentionally invented this new

1045
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,359
language

1046
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,079
in order to do actual quantum

1047
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:56,880
computation

1048
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,640
so it's not uh a modification of the

1049
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,760
existing language

1050
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,960
is its own so that's the advantage of

1051
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,359
that

1052
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,560
and yeah so all of these different types

1053
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:08,960
of

1054
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,240
developers that we

1055
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,160
we currently have a great pool of

1056
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,359
talents but

1057
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,720
we also need a lot more

1058
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,280
yeah thanks any other questions about

1059
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,000
your own

1060
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,200
experience so

1061
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,240
it doesn't have to be your own thing you

1062
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,520
can

1063
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,359
talk about your friends too sanchi

1064
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,640
says an open-ended question perhaps

1065
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,960
one of the attendees could help out yeah

1066
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,920
they'll be great if

1067
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,560
anyone knows you can feel free to post

1068
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,240
or connect yourselves offline

1069
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,040
they're currently pursuing masters in

1070
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,800
scientific

1071
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,839
scientific computing where a lot of

1072
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,960
their courses involve finite volume of

1073
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,079
finite element

1074
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,280
methods okay applied to

1075
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,640
magneto hydrodynamics radiative

1076
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,599
transfer etc they're wondering if there

1077
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,000
is

1078
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,359
some way that they could use skills

1079
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,800
from say fem to quantum computing

1080
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,200
or perhaps as a possible application on

1081
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,319
quantum computing

1082
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,760
i think so yeah um you're doing a lot of

1083
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,040
i guess simulations and

1084
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,520
uh we actually also built simulators

1085
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,800
for quantum hardware

1086
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,440
and we also have resource estimators to

1087
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,720
estimate

1088
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,640
how much resources how to run the

1089
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,359
algorithm how many gates

1090
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,640
was the quantum volume that's needed

1091
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,359
so that type of skill is also very

1092
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,079
important

1093
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,119
very helpful there and

1094
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,560
perhaps you can definitely come up with

1095
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,280
applications for quantum computers uh

1096
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,119
perhaps the problem that you're solving

1097
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,280
has to be solved with a quantum computer

1098
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,160
or

1099
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,839
it will be hard for a classical computer

1100
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,680
but then becomes easy

1101
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,480
like i can think of some simulations i

1102
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,040
did

1103
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,440
uh like back in grad school simulating

1104
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,560
graphing is a one sheet layer of

1105
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,040
graphite

1106
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,119
is sandwiched in between bunch of other

1107
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,400
materials

1108
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,960
and to simulate that one layer was

1109
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,079
extremely hard

1110
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,800
because the mesh point would be very

1111
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,400
different

1112
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,400
the mesh for other materials are much

1113
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,000
larger but then when you want to

1114
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
simulate one layer

1115
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,200
you can't really make such a fine mesh

1116
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,599
and force a computer to do that because

1117
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,560
it would

1118
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,240
not finish simulation so we did model it

1119
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,760
differently with electrical

1120
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,680
engineering methods so it's treating it

1121
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,839
as a special

1122
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,160
metal layer but i guess if

1123
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,400
perhaps we will need at some point

1124
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,839
simulating

1125
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,440
each carbon on a graphene layer

1126
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,119
with a quantum computer that might be

1127
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,800
very interesting

1128
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,520
but depends on what you're trying to do

1129
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,760
more of the quantum simulation so

1130
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,960
actually

1131
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,160
you can read all of all about that on

1132
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,040
the

1133
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,200
quantum computing documentation let me

1134
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:43,839
show you

1135
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,979
[Music]

1136
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:07,280
[Music]

1137
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,079
this this is our documentation that our

1138
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,680
class is also

1139
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,599
heavily based on we have

1140
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,920
all the information that you need about

1141
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,119
q sharp

1142
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,920
and we have the user guide with the

1143
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,680
simulators and resource estimator

1144
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,640
explained

1145
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,599
you can read a lot about them just from

1146
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,359
the documentation

1147
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,000
so here here you are that's that's what

1148
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,359
you need there

1149
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,440
and earlier i mentioned the links to

1150
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,640
open source

1151
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,839
is under resources you can find in how

1152
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:40,880
to contribute to

1153
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,440
qdk

1154
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
all of the links are here we also

1155
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,079
let you know how the community can

1156
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,040
contribute

1157
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,839
and here are the open source repos that

1158
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:54,559
you can

1159
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,640
already start working on

1160
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,839
essentially for has a follow-up oh yeah

1161
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,200
have a hard time understanding the

1162
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,559
suitable use cases

1163
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,599
of quantum computing um yeah so

1164
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,559
in our class we gave some examples of

1165
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,480
algorithms that can really use the power

1166
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,400
of quantum computers but for sure we

1167
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,760
need a lot more

1168
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,040
and today what you can do or you can

1169
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,000
already

1170
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,280
use quantum logic for is the quantum

1171
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,000
inspired

1172
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,200
algorithms they are

1173
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,598
intrinsically classical problems

1174
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,839
that can be formulated in

1175
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,599
a quantum manner say you want to

1176
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,760
optimize your expanding or

1177
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,520
logistics you can describe your system

1178
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,319
into a hamiltonian to solve the

1179
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,079
eigenstate of

1180
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,440
your matrix then

1181
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,760
that gives you the minimum point of your

1182
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,800
cost

1183
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,359
so that's one example that a lot of

1184
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,160
industry is already adopting

1185
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,160
with quantum inspired methods

1186
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,200
um or actual quantum

1187
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,319
we have uh

1188
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,800
just a lot of work on developing a

1189
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,920
hardware that can run

1190
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,079
these useful algorithms quantum

1191
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,720
algorithms

1192
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,200
i think i just saw another question

1193
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,839
there

1194
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,440
we need to stop sharing this

1195
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,960
team is getting a little stuck

1196
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,160
nathan says use

1197
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,440
hansen's tools in their team for

1198
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,040
electromagnetic mechanical and thermal

1199
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:05,839
simulation

1200
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:10,880
yeah i use comsol for my simulations

1201
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,839
um

1202
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,920
and um

1203
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,079
you mentioned that classical that's

1204
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,520
eleanor

1205
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,720
classical quantum compute classical

1206
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,240
computing would

1207
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,440
exist alongside quantum computing

1208
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,280
how are we dealing with security

1209
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,040
problems related to non-quantum

1210
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,319
cryptography

1211
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,720
is it likely that quantum safe

1212
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,760
algorithms are implementable

1213
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,240
on classical computing systems at large

1214
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:44,960
scale

1215
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,680
yeah it's great question i i don't know

1216
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,880
i

1217
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,040
i'm not familiar with cryptography and

1218
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:51,920
how that

1219
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,400
implication is but taro uh tara in

1220
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,160
our audience he may be able to give you

1221
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,359
much more answer to that on quantum

1222
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,880
cryptography

1223
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,839
and post quantum cryptography

1224
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,800
cool

1225
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,440
submit hasn't yet become a problem

1226
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,079
yeah i think we have to worry about it

1227
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,880
though we have to think about it

1228
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,680
oh tara mentioned a course tomorrow at 1

1229
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,720
30 eastern

1230
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,319
usa you can share i know

1231
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,440
taro posted the link to their meetup

1232
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,720
you can check it out they actually

1233
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,880
consolidated

1234
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,160
a lot of resources from all kinds of

1235
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:50,960
quantum meetups

1236
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,680
so with regards to cyber security i i

1237
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,720
just wanted to

1238
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,880
you know add on that that there are for

1239
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,720
example certain algorithms such as for

1240
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,599
example des

1241
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,400
or even tls 1.0 you can actually grab

1242
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:02,880
the

1243
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,960
random number generator for example or

1244
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,240
even the keys

1245
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,319
but the idea in quantum is that

1246
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,280
obviously

1247
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,240
you can almost have a true randomness so

1248
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,000
that itself protects against it

1249
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,240
but currently the quantum computers are

1250
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,000
not powerful enough

1251
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,559
to actually break a 2048 bit encryption

1252
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:21,760
for example

1253
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,720
but in the future it will be and you

1254
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,319
know as i mentioned last time

1255
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,880
the lattice base cryptography is the one

1256
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,359
that's

1257
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,480
already in place and dod and

1258
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,319
you know where it really matters they're

1259
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,920
already implementing lattice-based

1260
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,160
cryptography which will not be impacted

1261
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,920
by quantum computing so that's what i

1262
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,640
wanted to add

1263
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,000
thanks um i think we can also

1264
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,920
if anyone in the audience is interested

1265
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,119
in giving a

1266
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,240
presentation feel free to let me know

1267
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,160
and we can set up a time submit if you

1268
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,520
want to give a class

1269
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,040
on that that would be will be nice

1270
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,880
so let me know hit me or uh

1271
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,599
i i think directly just right on the

1272
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,040
hackaday

1273
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,240
page in the com comment section if you

1274
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,160
want to teach any particular topic

1275
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,559
i'm i'm happy to cover you know how

1276
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,200
classical

1277
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,599
cryptography works and what stuff will

1278
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:20,880
change in the future

1279
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,440
but um you know we we can agree on a

1280
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,839
time yeah i can do that thank you

1281
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,200
yeah thomas comments classical computers

1282
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,480
can also connect

1283
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,040
and make use of quantum devices

1284
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,160
yeah i guess we could have a specific

1285
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,040
topic on

1286
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,960
quantum cryptography i would love to

1287
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,960
learn that too lg

1288
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,800
mentions they would like to reach out

1289
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,319
and assist

1290
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,520
anyone with iot sensor data

1291
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,240
great maybe david you can

1292
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,160
connect

1293
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,799
yes thank you

1294
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,720
cool thanks everyone let's uh

1295
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,839
finish for today
