2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,480
hi everyone

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,799
um so today we're going to do

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,280
more solids moving on from our curves

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,720
and our surfaces

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,880
and then some subdivision surfaces which

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,039
is new in rhino but

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,600
pre-existing in 3d max and mine and

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,199
other softwares

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,240
and um we're just going to learn

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,359
a couple tools of how solids are dealt

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,159
so

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,760
the from the introduction uh

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,559
lecture um you might remember that i

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,520
said lino is a

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,800
surface by default software

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,360
so that if i took a bite out of any sort

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,440
of spherical shape in mine though

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,879
that it will always be hollow on the

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,879
inside whereas solidworks

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,120
creo and other solid based software

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,719
perform more like an orange where if you

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,920
take a bite out of them they actually

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
have a solid material on the inside

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,080
so one of the ways that might appear as

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,159
different or problematic is if i had a

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,920
sphere

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,159
and then made a bigger sphere um with

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,680
the same center point

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,600
in a solid-based software i'd be able to

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,840
subtract the smaller sphere from a big

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,960
sphere

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,080
and then use a cut plane chop it in two

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,520
and open it up and it would be kind of

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,080
like an avocado um

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,920
without the sort of seed or the shell um

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,960
but in rhino because

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,840
it doesn't see the solids that's just a

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,799
surface that

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,840
is not intersecting with another surface

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,400
therefore

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
rhino will just say in the command bar

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,000
boolean split failed

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,680
could not do that the only way

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,960
rhino will deal with solids uh

46
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,399
interacting with other solids is when

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,079
their surfaces are actually intersecting

48
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,960
with each other

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,159
and touching so if i did this

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,079
small sphere and large sphere and i

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,360
did a boolean subtraction early in this

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,040
call

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,560
the uh volume of the

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,599
uh small sphere would cut away from the

55
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,040
big sphere

56
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,520
and i would end up with this sort of uh

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
star wars death star like shave

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,440
um but what's really happening from a

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,040
rhino perspective because it only thinks

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,160
and surfaces

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,520
is it is splitting

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,840
the smaller surface then chopping that

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,959
off then adding that

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,080
to the big sphere and then uh

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,680
joining them together and then making

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
that as the complete shape

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,280
so when i was on about older versions of

68
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,800
rhino and older computers

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,959
that's why if you did too many billions

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,879
rhino would crash because the

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
it's just doing too much computing but

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
in solid-based software

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,319
they think natively in solids and it's

74
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,800
not so much of a problem

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,080
in rhino um if if there's a command

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,040
split

77
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,280
split will think in surfaces but the

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,959
command boolean split

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,560
will think in solids so depending on

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
what command you use

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,959
will be how rhino responds and thinks

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,680
whether

83
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,200
it's meant to think as a surface or

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,959
meant to simulate this sort of solid

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,159
behavior

86
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,840
so if i take this sort of rectangular

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,959
volume and i add a whole bunch of

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,319
spheres along uh intersecting with the

89
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,959
edge surface of the rectangular volume

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,400
and i do a boolean

91
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,319
uh difference now i'll end up with this

92
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,920
kind of like cheese-like shape where it

93
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,519
has

94
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,239
removed all of those spherical shapes

95
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,280
and attach them

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,760
to the rectangular shape giving me this

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
sort of cheese like thing and now that's

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,080
now

99
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,560
one object so if i click that that's one

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
sort of solid object if i exploded it

101
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,560
i would have the separate surfaces but

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,239
that's now a solid

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,720
volume

104
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,080
if uh the order is important of course

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,640
so

106
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,519
um generally you're going to select the

107
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,640
volume to be cut

108
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,319
first and then select the cutting

109
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,400
objects it will ask you to input them as

110
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,920
a second

111
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,000
step which you read the command prompt

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
and make sure you get the first and

113
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,599
second

114
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,840
if i did it in the reverse order i would

115
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,120
get the spheres

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,840
um or the rectangular volume subtracted

117
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,959
from the spheres

118
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,918
so examples of where this appears in uh

119
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,120
real world which

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,639
i'd always do architecture because what

121
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,520
i know here's a building

122
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,800
where you have these large

123
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,560
buildings i guess built during modernism

124
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
where they were at these really deep

125
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,440
floor plans and they were the

126
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,919
sort of urban design was too big and the

127
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,440
general trend now is to have

128
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,120
buildings that air and light can move

129
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,880
through so they they're

130
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,199
designing buildings where you're just

131
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,160
subtracting

132
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,840
the interior volumes from the larger

133
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,280
volume where this

134
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
should really be four towers but it's

135
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,440
just made as it's our overall

136
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,080
uh singular structure still trying to

137
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,639
get the

138
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,240
the smaller um distance from window to

139
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,040
interior uh so in this case it's a cube

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,360
with

141
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,759
these sort of ellipsoid solids removed

142
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,720
from it

143
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,840
and then just the contour command and

144
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
3d print and this is a

145
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,759
uh different one by zahid where it's

146
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,880
more of a

147
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,080
um sort of smooth fluid surface

148
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,000
probably what we're going to learn later

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
today a subdivision surface

150
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,960
and it's just the cube uh

151
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,919
subtract or the uh the interior volume

152
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,758
subtracted from the the larger volume

153
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,520
so um we'll

154
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
when i open the software we'll do some

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,720
boolean kind of uh

156
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,000
subtraction i'll show you how it works

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,560
but that's kind of for booleans

158
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,919
um if i was to take several curves and

159
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,199
um they're just slightly different

160
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,759
i can use the pipe command which is a

161
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,120
way of going from a curve

162
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,000
to a solid and it's going to ask you for

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,199
a radius at

164
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,639
either end of the pipe so as long as i

165
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,880
put the same radius

166
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
if i start with a straight curve i will

167
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,560
get a straight pipe it works for curved

168
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,440
pipes

169
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,560
if the this line here

170
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,440
is a a polyline where it's joined where

171
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,039
this is separate polylines

172
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,560
and notice when you're using the pipe

173
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
command it performs differently

174
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,639
if they are joined or not joined

175
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,840
so these kind of automatically sort of

176
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,880
miter cuts them

177
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,120
and this just sort of leaves them open

178
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,280
so you might want to in certain cases

179
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,400
rebuild the curve

180
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,600
before doing the pipe command

181
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,759
which um so it's all joined and it's

182
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,720
going to do a single pipe command

183
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
if i was to do a different radius that

184
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,020
would be

185
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,919
[Music]

186
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,600
sort of this tapered pipes and it

187
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,599
doesn't work that well

188
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,000
on poly lines it just sort of makes

189
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,880
three separate pipes

190
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,199
the problem uh or one sort of

191
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,919
problem for the last several editions of

192
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,800
rhino

193
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,560
was how do you do three pipes coming to

194
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,240
an intersection and you could sort of

195
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,479
come to a certain extent but how do you

196
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,919
make this

197
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
uh three pipes kind of come together and

198
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,680
in nurbs curve

199
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,880
curves it's it's quite difficult um

200
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,520
you sort of have to do a lot of uh

201
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,960
intersecting and then trimming and then

202
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
splitting and

203
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,479
that it doesn't even look that great and

204
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,319
and it takes

205
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,080
like 10 20 minutes just to do this

206
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,360
intersection

207
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,599
so with subdivision curves that we're

208
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,400
going to

209
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,560
explore in more detail but we can now

210
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
use the multi-pipe command

211
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,080
just select the three curves which are

212
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,520
nurbs curves and it will just

213
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,120
automatically make

214
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
this sort of a polygonal uh mesh shape

215
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
that uh does it much neither so this

216
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,720
multiply

217
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,319
command is going to be useful when you

218
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,759
start drawing the kettle that i

219
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,520
mentioned last week

220
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,520
when um when typing in vinyl

221
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,400
sel to select which is another great way

222
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
of if you have a lot of information

223
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,400
in the model just select only curves or

224
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,680
select open curves only get open curves

225
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,800
this is a subdivision surface not a

226
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
nerve's polysurface so select

227
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,120
polysurface would not select

228
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,199
this object but select subdivision would

229
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,199
select this object and not

230
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,000
other objects in the model so this is

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,720
the kettle

232
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,080
um i'm gonna draw and uh hopefully you

233
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,720
guys

234
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,839
manage drawing it as well um it's a pour

235
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,719
over kettle so

236
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,839
it's for having a very thin spout

237
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,200
and pouring out the water very slowly

238
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,039
that's sort of amazing so the first

239
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,320
thing i would do is

240
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,399
uh i just i just made this in slides

241
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,920
hopefully it's more

242
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,200
easier to see the steps um

243
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
so i i'd sort of bring in the picture of

244
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,040
the the kettle and i would just trace

245
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,680
over

246
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,519
with these lines i wouldn't worry too

247
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,040
much about

248
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
um trying to make the curves because i'm

249
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,720
going to fill it them

250
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,000
afterwards and because i want

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,279
the pipe um to

252
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
overstep the um curved area

253
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
um i want this line to to come over the

254
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,000
curve and i'll show you that in the 3d

255
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,120
model

256
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,839
so first thing i'll do is draw these as

257
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,080
curves then i would do all my filleting

258
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
of different amounts to kind of get the

259
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,920
round parts

260
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,720
they go on here another one here here

261
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,040
here

262
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,720
so then into perspective view i'm going

263
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,680
to select

264
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,120
this um edge curve of the main thing and

265
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,399
use the revolve command

266
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
the same as the chess piece do a full

267
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,920
360

268
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,040
uh revolve and then do the same thing

269
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,360
with

270
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,640
the uh top here which is a thermometer

271
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,839
in real life

272
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,720
for this then i can do my multi-pipe

273
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,680
uh on this uh three different curves

274
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,399
here

275
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,079
and um i want it not to be capped

276
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,680
because a capped multi-pipe will make it

277
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,040
smooth so i have to do the caps

278
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,160
manually in nerves

279
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,440
and see how it oversteps the interior of

280
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,360
this sort of revolved shape

281
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,959
and i do the same thing here i can just

282
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,800
do a regular pipe there

283
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,160
and because this is separate curves

284
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,070
if they are not joined um

285
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,519
[Music]

286
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,279
these intersections won't work out

287
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,519
properly so it's very important that

288
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,959
initial curve is joined

289
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,160
then if i do a split on the handle

290
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,279
so the handle currently just

291
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,760
overreaches the interior if i do a split

292
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,200
it's going to change

293
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,959
that surface into a

294
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,120
nurbs poly surface and you can see how

295
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,880
complicated that intersection is

296
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,839
that's why we didn't want to do it

297
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,760
manually

298
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,600
and that's just trimming to make that

299
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,519
sort of because that's not a perfect

300
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,880
circle because it's sort of going around

301
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,440
the

302
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,240
curved edge the next thing i want to do

303
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,000
in modeling this kettle

304
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,519
is um this has a cut plane here

305
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,320
so if i went into 2d and did a cut plane

306
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,360
which

307
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,760
any object i just select cut plane draw

308
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,519
over it in a two-dimensional view

309
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,480
and it just makes a surface that

310
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,320
perfectly overlaps everything

311
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,959
that i selected because if if a cut

312
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,320
plane

313
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,480
doesn't cut entirely through a shape it

314
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,519
just says

315
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,279
rhino that says does not work kind of

316
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,760
like the the boolean problem just

317
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,959
cannot cut if it doesn't finish the the

318
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,120
full cut

319
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,760
and that will trim uh this to be flat

320
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
which is how the

321
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,800
kettle should look and that gives it a

322
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
good pour according to the coffee

323
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,680
enthusiasts and then i can

324
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,320
offset uh surfaces which makes them a

325
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,240
solid and gives them a thickness

326
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,279
if i wanted to 3d print the object or or

327
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,399
do something they would want to have a

328
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,959
thickness because

329
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,519
as i mentioned in week one surfaces and

330
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,399
curves

331
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,760
in rhino are a thickness of zero so they

332
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,519
have no thickness unless they are

333
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,800
a closed shape uh or closed uh poly

334
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,600
surface

335
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,000
so now i've offset a thickness and i've

336
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,040
done this

337
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,680
deliberately in the wrong order because

338
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,440
now

339
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,880
i have this problem at the top of the

340
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,920
spout and

341
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,959
all surfaces in rhino will have a normal

342
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,639
sort of a face and a back face they have

343
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,639
a front order and a

344
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,760
back sort of face that's important for

345
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,560
rendering

346
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,800
um which side is the inside which side

347
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,839
is the outside

348
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,600
also if you're extruding one way the

349
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,440
default way would be

350
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,560
to go the normal direction and when we

351
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,399
open software i'll show you how to

352
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,639
flip the normal and see what the normal

353
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,320
is and how to control the normal

354
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,839
so now i need to get the cup line again

355
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,839
and trim that

356
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,120
to be perfectly flat which is now flat

357
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,079
as a solid

358
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,160
and that's kind of the steps needed to

359
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,959
draw this cabin

360
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,519
so uh and there's it started in 3d view

361
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,399
and you can see it's

362
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,399
it's got its thickness there um i'm not

363
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,399
trying to make this for manufacturing so

364
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,560
there is some interior details inside

365
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
here of

366
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,040
a weld and sort of a screw but

367
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,399
i'm just going to worry about the sort

368
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,320
of volume uh

369
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,760
for this exercise so we don't go into

370
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,000
too much detail

371
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,639
um and then i just thought i'd share you

372
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,360
wanna or

373
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,720
thought i'd share one extra tool with

374
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,120
you i've never used this tool

375
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,760
but just to show you what a cage edit is

376
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,320
um

377
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
that is where you sort of select a

378
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,600
bounding box around

379
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,800
any uh volume you select

380
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,399
the uh amount of points you want so in

381
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,839
this case i just did a three by three

382
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,560
grid

383
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,199
and then i can deform this to anything

384
00:13:59,199 --> 00:13:59,839
it still

385
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,920
nurbs curves uh depending on how it's

386
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,839
constructed it will stay together

387
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,199
in its um deformed shape but it's

388
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,480
a fully three-dimensional deformation of

389
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,600
a solid shape so with that i'm gonna

390
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,090
jump into rhino and show you

391
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,399
[Music]

392
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,519
how to draw a cap

393
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,040
so the first thing we're going to do is

394
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,240
load in our picture

395
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,959
which just any downloaded jpeg will work

396
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,399
and i'm gonna do zero comma zero comma

397
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,320
zero to get the first corner

398
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,440
so i select it there um i don't

399
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,279
really care about what scale this is

400
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,040
because i'm not making in real life

401
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,360
but um if i was to

402
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:58,639
uh i'll just do 300 ml later

403
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,000
okay so um

404
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,480
that's a scale um if i did have a proper

405
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,160
scale or proper measurement

406
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,959
of the kettle in my kitchen i could um

407
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,120
do this more accurately

408
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,480
um so then i want to rotate 3d to make

409
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,360
sure

410
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,199
the kettle is sort of vertical

411
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,880
i'm going to type the layer to bring up

412
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,639
the layers

413
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,000
and i want this

414
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,519
change layer and i'll put that on

415
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,120
there one and then i'm going to

416
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,480
lock it so that means it's not clickable

417
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,639
but still there in the background

418
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,839
so now

419
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,800
there's a double-click front to sort of

420
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,770
expand this view

421
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,959
[Music]

422
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,480
and draw some curves

423
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,440
so i'm really going to do a revolve in

424
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,800
in a minute so

425
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,120
i'm just interested in half the geometry

426
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,279
um i don't need to go further than that

427
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,959
i do want to make sure that end point is

428
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:07,519
selected

429
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,759
just hover over and get that end point

430
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,480
go past the curve

431
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,190
um

432
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,519
[Music]

433
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,399
then ortho is on so i can't do the

434
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,519
diagonal f8 is the short for ortho

435
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,680
um which depending if you're using a

436
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,519
laptop you might need the function key

437
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,519
to be clicked but i can just click it

438
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,560
here on the screen

439
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,880
from the bottom so it snaps and now i

440
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,959
can do

441
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,279
uh off the sort of horizontal vertical

442
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,680
and that's something for that one and

443
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,399
then

444
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,000
this photo is kind of difficult to pick

445
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,480
the bottom point and

446
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,320
um um now i want ortho to be on again

447
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,880
because i want a perfectly horizontal

448
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,040
line

449
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,959
so that's those curves um

450
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,479
this top bit is

451
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,400
i'm just gonna get near so now i know

452
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,119
that those

453
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:19,839
uh two lines are perfectly aligned and

454
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,119
so for the pipe command i want uh

455
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,679
the middle uh of

456
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,520
these shapes and again i'm gonna

457
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:47,840
turn orto off to get that one

458
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,200
and in this case i want to overstep this

459
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,840
one as well

460
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,000
okay so that's the geometry i need which

461
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,120
if i had scaled up properly it would be

462
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,400
perfect so i can do the light bulbs turn

463
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,799
off

464
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,600
layer one which turns off my um

465
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
i'm just going to guess um a lot of

466
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,080
these filleted shapes rather do it from

467
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
there

468
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,160
so the amount of filler will directly

469
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,440
depend on what scale your model is

470
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,400
and

471
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,640
[Music]

472
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,640
so trim command just get rid of that one

473
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,520
and then

474
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:25,840
a little fill it

475
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,160
yeah and another trim

476
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,880
like this

477
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,520
and this time i need this to overlap uh

478
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,960
which ortho is not on so it's not

479
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,160
dragging

480
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,160
horizontally so f8 to turn ortho on i'm

481
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,799
going to

482
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,160
step over and then some fillets over

483
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,840
here too

484
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:07,840
very good

485
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,799
okay so now i can drag over this

486
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,000
and type join so now that's five curves

487
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,440
you can see read up on the command

488
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,080
line five curves joined into one open

489
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,880
curve

490
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,360
and if i select that it selects of one

491
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,080
uh i

492
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,360
similarly want that curve

493
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,080
that curve the affiliated curve that

494
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,520
care of the philosophic curve there can

495
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,320
focus curve

496
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,400
and i want to join them so it says six

497
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
curves joined into one

498
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,240
and now they select as one and then this

499
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,360
whole top thing

500
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,200
join that as well so it's three curves

501
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,679
joined into one so now they are

502
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,679
uh each one of those curves is just one

503
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,720
joined object

504
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,840
and that can stay the way it is and

505
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,158
i can now go into 3d view

506
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,679
so the first thing i want to do is

507
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,440
select that curve

508
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,400
and type revolve and i need to give it

509
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,880
the

510
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,440
central axis which is just like this

511
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,679
point and this point at the bottom

512
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,280
and i can just type 360 rather than

513
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,280
drag it around and it should

514
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,000
work so type 360 and there we go and

515
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,799
if i do this one if i right click i get

516
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,400
the same command as i used previously

517
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,200
which can

518
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,559
get me going pretty fast and i need a

519
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,640
resolve axis

520
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,240
so i click that point um if i didn't

521
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,520
i mean i could click that center point

522
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,120
but i could also just control click and

523
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,480
then just click anywhere and that gives

524
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,799
it

525
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,000
a perfect thing uh start point

526
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,080
and if i drag it around that's how the

527
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,039
dragging works

528
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,039
so i need to drag it all the way

529
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,799
and then left click when it's done

530
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,200
and then right click when it's done and

531
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,880
that gives that shape so

532
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,760
now i'm going to do my multi-pipe and

533
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,440
i'm going to type multi-pipe and it's

534
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
going to say select the curves so i want

535
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,360
this curve this characteristic

536
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,799
and enter or right click and set the

537
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,799
pipe radius i'm just going to put at 15

538
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,480
see if that works

539
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,960
cap ends i'll just turn them on to show

540
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,280
you what that looks like

541
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,200
um and then i can type zero or one here

542
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,559
so the problem with

543
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,320
the cap ends being on is it's gonna

544
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,600
smooth them which is not what i'm

545
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,200
looking for so i want the cap to be

546
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
off and uh

547
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,919
also probably a smaller radius

548
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,200
so let's try um

549
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,159
eight cap off so i click on these

550
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:48,960
options

551
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,320
and then um this can be smooth

552
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,919
or not smooth by typing zero or one

553
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,799
i'm going to let's say if i put zero

554
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,600
first

555
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,320
it basically makes it too loose here

556
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,880
which is

557
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,679
not what i'm looking for so you can just

558
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,600
redo that

559
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,640
and type one for not smooth and that's

560
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,080
the shape i'm kind of looking for

561
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,640
so these are now open because i didn't

562
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,080
want to count them with a subdivision i

563
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,559
want to cap them with a

564
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,600
nurbs curve so i can type dup

565
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,240
and then edge or border which is

566
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
duplicate which is how i go from

567
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,600
any surface to a curve so i basically

568
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,480
want

569
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,799
this curve which i if i double click it

570
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,120
selects the whole circle

571
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,520
and you can see that's holding down

572
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,480
shift to hold get both of them

573
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,039
so now they are curves they're probably

574
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,000
separate so i'm gonna

575
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,720
while they're still selected type join

576
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,840
uh

577
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,480
select them again

578
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,080
or maybe they are so yeah they're

579
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,200
already done

580
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,360
so now i can take the two curves that i

581
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,039
duplicated that are sort of at this

582
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,240
angle

583
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,600
and tie a planar surface which should

584
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,840
fill them in so that fills them in

585
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,039
fine if i

586
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,279
joined the planar surfaces

587
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,440
to the subdivision it would just become

588
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,360
a subdivision or sorry become a

589
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,279
nerve's surface it would sort of convert

590
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,960
it automatically

591
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,240
um but i want to split this um

592
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,159
if i had of um go into a different view

593
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,720
and do zoom all

594
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,760
selected if

595
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,320
i had of um gone right to the edge

596
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,720
um then when i did the multi-pipe the

597
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,240
multi-pipe would stop

598
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,480
at this point and i'd be missing this

599
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,640
tiny amount so that's why i kind of over

600
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,799
overstepped it so that it would get that

601
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,240
thing and now basically

602
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,480
i want to do a split uh i'm not going to

603
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,760
do a boolean split because there's still

604
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,200
surfaces

605
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,919
so select object to be split which is

606
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,000
the subdivision and then i select the

607
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,440
cutting objects which i want that to be

608
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,919
the revolved kind of kettle shape

609
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,720
and now i can select

610
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,840
this uh part which is i don't need

611
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,039
um probably not necessary for modeling

612
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,720
but if i wanted to i could select the

613
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,080
kettle shape

614
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
and right click just to repeat the last

615
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,679
command which is split

616
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,000
and split the kettle with this poly

617
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,320
surface because that's now poly surface

618
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,960
and uh right click to press enter and

619
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,250
that's just going to

620
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,600
[Music]

621
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,880
uh remove that circle there

622
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,279
it's going like cut the hole

623
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,679
so same thing on the other side um we've

624
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,760
already joined this so it should pipe as

625
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,840
a single pipe

626
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,520
and it's a much smaller uh spout

627
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,480
so we can just do pipe which is going to

628
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:10,799
be

629
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,919
a nerds command

630
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,760
and let's just try four so if i type

631
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,360
the the what's in the brackets here is

632
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,960
what it's currently set to 15

633
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,120
i don't want 15. so if i type 4 at the

634
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,840
end uh

635
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,360
and for the other end

636
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,039
i get yeah that's about right um

637
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,840
okay oh

638
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,960
um so i guess i didn't make that far

639
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,679
enough

640
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,960
um so i can do extend

641
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,400
and if you do extend the regular extend

642
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,760
it asks for what you want to extend to

643
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,039
but i just want it to extend anywhere

644
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,840
which extend dynamic is just a better

645
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,320
extent so i can then select the curve

646
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,840
and then just drag it past

647
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,039
and then we can do our pipe again four

648
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,440
four enter and now we have

649
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,120
that and this looks perfect and i want

650
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,960
to select this and type split

651
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,520
select cutting object and that's going

652
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,919
to remove

653
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,960
this little part and then

654
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,679
if order was to move i want the the

655
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,000
other part coming out of here as well

656
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,840
so um that's split

657
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,600
object to be split enter cutting object

658
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
it's going to make the cut enter and

659
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,039
that should um

660
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,720
so they're like separate surfaces but i

661
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,159
want to delete the

662
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,840
circle because and then

663
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,080
um now that's like perfectly

664
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,919
fitting and it's those kind of things by

665
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,159
the way that if you didn't notice

666
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,399
these microscopic openings and you went

667
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,320
to 3d print that it just wouldn't work

668
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
because

669
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,039
an open solid is not a solid and a 3d

670
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,840
printer just can't see it

671
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,399
so i can now select

672
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,880
the um let's say spout

673
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,039
and i want to type cut plane which is

674
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,640
going to give

675
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,880
create a surface which perfectly cuts

676
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,159
and i want to basically

677
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,279
chop off from this corner so i'm going

678
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,720
to select this corner and then

679
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,080
just sew it there and it creates the cut

680
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,840
plane all the way to cover

681
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,440
this in case uh see there's another one

682
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,880
it covers the whole thing and i can use

683
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,440
the split command

684
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,000
to so there's the poly surface

685
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,159
split select the cut plane and then i

686
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,679
don't need the cut plane anymore and i

687
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,600
don't need this top part

688
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,640
so there is our

689
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,399
shape and um

690
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,159
and then now if we want to make this

691
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,600
thickness the last command offset

692
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,840
surface

693
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,530
so i type offset surface um

694
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,440
[Music]

695
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,720
i select this shape and i it asks me so

696
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,960
here's the normal direction so it

697
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,799
currently wants to

698
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,640
come outward i actually want it to go

699
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,000
inward so

700
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,240
it says select object to flip direction

701
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,840
so if i left click it

702
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,080
um it goes inward and if i left click it

703
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,960
it goes outward

704
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,039
so i can choose once i want to go inward

705
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,720
and i right click to say

706
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,120
go inward and it's currently set at

707
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,679
distance of 0.3

708
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,200
that's probably this

709
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,000
so it's ever so slightly thick let's

710
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,679
just do a bigger thickness

711
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,559
so it shows better um

712
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,000
yeah so there is a very thick wall to

713
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,720
the kettle but

714
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,760
fine and

715
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,960
if i do the same thing for the spout

716
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,399
so again it's it's wants to go outward

717
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,960
you know left click to go inward

718
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,880
and oh i did

719
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,919
let me just do a thinner

720
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,960
let's just do one

721
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,679
and there's that problem at the top

722
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,399
that i kind of mentioned so i need

723
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,679
another cut plane

724
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,120
but when i chop this time i want to chop

725
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,880
from the lowest possible point which is

726
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,840
there

727
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,480
my ortho is on so it's horizontal so

728
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,760
that's

729
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,120
my perfect chopping plane and

730
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,880
i'll show you what split does in this

731
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,480
case just to show you the difference

732
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,640
between the two

733
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,559
so if i type split and then use the

734
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,000
cutting plane

735
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,279
and then i delete the

736
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,720
geometry here this is now open like it's

737
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,679
just

738
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,440
um which i could select those two

739
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,240
circles and

740
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,640
and do a planar surface but it's just

741
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,600
extra steps

742
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,840
the smarter thing to do is

743
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,080
when doing the split to do boolean split

744
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
so it starts to think in solids not in

745
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,039
surfaces

746
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:33,840
then select the cut plane and now

747
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,840
i can delete that and that

748
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,120
should be solid cut so if i go to my

749
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,880
rendered view

750
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,840
there is my spout

751
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,239
[Music]

752
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,600
so

753
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,159
it'll probably take you too long to draw

754
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:02,880
that

755
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,360
um so maybe we'll just continue on to

756
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,399
subdivisions

757
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,320
um and then i'll just stay around for

758
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,600
questions at the end we'll do it in the

759
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,240
normal format of an hour

760
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,640
and then you start drawing um and ask

761
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,559
questions and i'll stick around

762
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,200
but that's the teapot pretty much done

763
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,880
uh or sorry

764
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,120
pour over kettle done and um

765
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
in real life it has a few little extra

766
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,519
complexities inside of uh

767
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,360
there and that this is a thermometer so

768
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
it has a sort of metal part that goes

769
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,960
down into the cattle but

770
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,519
from the external uh perspective it's

771
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,600
fine

772
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,840
so um

773
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,559
if i um i'm just going to delete that

774
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,159
because i don't need it but

775
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,440
you guys might want to save it if you

776
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,200
want to

777
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,150
keep it james brandt has a question too

778
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,289
[Music]

779
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,480
he says if you're trying to fill it a

780
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,720
joint polyline is there a way to select

781
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,840
each section of a polyline

782
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,000
[Music]

783
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,880
oh yeah so um i'll just show you um

784
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,019
[Music]

785
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
if

786
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,679
if i'm gonna fill it something maybe i

787
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,200
went ahead with the left clicks a little

788
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,480
too fast

789
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,200
um but if they were separate i would

790
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,480
just click the first curve and click

791
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,120
the second curve they are one object but

792
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,720
i still click here

793
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,000
and selects the whole thing and then i

794
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,440
click here and it just thinks of them as

795
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,480
um two separate things so even in a

796
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,039
closed

797
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,399
polyline or a sort of closed

798
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,360
curve i can still go in for corners and

799
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,960
just select the left side and the right

800
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,399
side or the top side and bottom side and

801
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,600
it will fill it

802
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,320
that i think that's what the question is

803
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,480
yeah he says okay trying again couldn't

804
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,320
get that one reason

805
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,560
why i fill it or the main reason a

806
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,000
philip would not work

807
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,560
is when um when you fill it you're going

808
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,239
to need a radius to fill it

809
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,399
um and if you imagine um something being

810
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,440
um 10 centimeters or 100 millimeters by

811
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,399
100 millimeters

812
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,320
and you come in with a fillet that's uh

813
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,719
10 meters it's just gonna say will not

814
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,320
fill it if you come in with a fillet

815
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,359
that's too small

816
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,719
you might not be able to see it would

817
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,159
work but you wouldn't be able to see it

818
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:36,719
it would still

819
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,520
just look like a corner um so try around

820
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,719
with some radiuses

821
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,800
to make sure and know what scale you're

822
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,239
working in i would imagine that's

823
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,159
probably the issue but

824
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,199
do let me know i'm gonna jump into

825
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,879
uh is there any other questions or about

826
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,239
it princess thanks

827
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,599
uh yeah okay so um

828
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,040
we're gonna jump back into some slides

829
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,720
and the second part of uh

830
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,760
this week's lesson is in subdivision

831
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,560
services

832
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,680
so this

833
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,680
by many people is considered harder

834
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,760
certainly people i know in architectural

835
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,520
world who consider it harder

836
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,440
everyone in animation and virtual

837
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,800
reality and

838
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,359
nothing that's the default they learn is

839
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,720
is sort of polygonal modeling

840
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,839
i'll show you when we get into the

841
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,480
software but people you start at a

842
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,240
different point in nurbs curves

843
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,400
you usually start with curves and then

844
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,760
you mathematically construct those

845
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,200
curves very precisely

846
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,720
and then you bring those curves into

847
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,320
surfaces and then poly surfaces

848
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,079
so you start at the sort of basics and

849
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,520
you sort of you sort of build

850
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,640
the model and sort of through addition

851
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,160
in um subdivision a lot of the time you

852
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,079
start with a volume and you deform the

853
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,760
volume almost like sculpture

854
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,599
where sort of your volume is clay and

855
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,800
you're deforming it

856
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
and one of the ways you control it is

857
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
you turn on this gumball mode

858
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,800
and i'll show you what all these things

859
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,200
do but it's just one way of controlling

860
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,079
uh more useful some people have it on

861
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,119
all the time

862
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,119
i find it useful for subdivision kind of

863
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,119
annoying for nerves but

864
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,160
personal preferences i guess so

865
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,720
there's some new terminology when it

866
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,000
comes to

867
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,960
subdivisions so every subdivision has

868
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,440
these

869
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,720
sort of two views in rhino

870
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,880
if you click the tab button you go back

871
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,960
to the original geometry which is on the

872
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,320
left

873
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,720
and then the sort of simulated smooth

874
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
geometry which is on the right

875
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,720
but this is i've just made this in the

876
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,320
slideshow

877
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,880
tab on tab on tab off on the left and

878
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,640
tab on on the right but this is the same

879
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,240
shape it's the same

880
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,160
um object and so if i select the top

881
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,119
corner

882
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,200
um as a as a vertex or courtesy

883
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,280
that you see that that's that top point

884
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,560
there and that's that top point there

885
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,520
there the same point

886
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,760
um and and the terminology is kind of

887
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,440
important that you can sort of

888
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,520
when it comes to subdivisions you select

889
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,119
the vertices which are kind of like

890
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,000
points

891
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,040
uh or you select the edges which are

892
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,359
just

893
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,599
edges here which you see the yellow

894
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,680
selection on both sides

895
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,110
same edge

896
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,200
[Music]

897
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,520
you could select an edge ring which

898
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,880
would select all these edges and the

899
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,920
reason you do that is

900
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,760
when you have the edge ring you could

901
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,040
then scale it

902
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,680
or rotate it and it would start to

903
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,000
deform that smooth surface

904
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,359
so that's called an edge ring when

905
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,720
they're i guess parallel to each other

906
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,280
uh an edge loop when they it's just one

907
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,960
sort of continuous ring

908
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,720
they are all separate edges to be

909
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,160
selected but if you select

910
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,560
an edge loop it will select the whole

911
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,960
edge group

912
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,000
uh edge loop on the top side you can see

913
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,440
only actually selects

914
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,040
one edge of the cube it doesn't select

915
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,960
the whole top surface because it doesn't

916
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,079
really know which ones which

917
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,400
then we have faces and you can select a

918
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,920
face and extrude a face

919
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,040
or do what you want with a face but so

920
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,520
we have

921
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,359
uh vertexes uh

922
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,400
edges and faces

923
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,960
a face loop will be select all the faces

924
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,920
in a loop around

925
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,119
the object if we were to extrude

926
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,119
which the command is extrude subdivision

927
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,720
extrude curve will only work on curves

928
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,280
extrude

929
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
surface will only work on surfaces

930
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,480
extrude subdivision we're going to work

931
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,599
on simplifications

932
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,920
so extrude subdivision and we selected a

933
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,359
face

934
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,560
it would extrude the face but it would

935
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,280
add

936
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,960
um new surfaces so that's a new surface

937
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,640
that wasn't there before that's a new

938
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,320
or new face that's a new face that's a

939
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,760
new face behind and that's a new fix

940
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,040
behind as well

941
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,320
um if i was to select the face and i

942
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:54,800
would just

943
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,280
move it i would just drag it upward that

944
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,119
would be a very different command to

945
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,720
extruding it because when i extrude it i

946
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,599
get these

947
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,359
four new faces that weren't in the model

948
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,720
previously

949
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,359
so and i get new edge loops because i've

950
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,800
edges there if i was to

951
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,760
move it i wouldn't have that edge and

952
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,680
that edge loop

953
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,200
the mouse is there so um that's a

954
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,079
extrude subdivision extru phase i can

955
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:20,560
then

956
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,760
subdivide any of the faces

957
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,079
so the default will be to subdivide any

958
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,320
face into four which creates new faces

959
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,839
and then i select

960
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,040
new vertices new um

961
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,160
edges new faces and

962
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,440
um as i mentioned on the introduction

963
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,160
lecture if you were doing a face

964
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,200
you just continually subdivide the faces

965
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,000
into further further subdivisions to add

966
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,880
detail

967
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,960
so you might start with a sphere to form

968
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,480
it into kind of a head shape

969
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,440
then subdivide the the faces towards the

970
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,079
front

971
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,839
and begin to develop the nose and then

972
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,440
further subdivide them and add the

973
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
nostrils and then further subdivide them

974
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,880
and you just keep subdividing to add

975
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,560
detail so the back of the head would

976
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,640
have very little amount of geometry

977
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,920
but the the front of the shape would

978
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,200
have all these subdivisions and would be

979
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,839
quite complicated

980
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,560
uh you can delete the face if you see i

981
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,079
deleted on this side

982
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,440
and this is the only time that they're

983
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,280
actually different i deleted on

984
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,200
just so they face each other and i can

985
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,040
use the bridge command

986
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,240
which would these would currently select

987
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,000
if there were two separate subdivisions

988
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,079
select as two separate objects

989
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,920
but the bridge command would join them

990
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,680
together and add

991
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,880
new face new face interface new edges

992
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,000
and make it into one um

993
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,040
subdivision object so now all of these

994
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,599
faces

995
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,640
these edges is sort of one object

996
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,040
and we have extra subdivisions on each

997
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,400
of these sides and

998
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,920
this is what that would look like in the

999
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,680
smooth view

1000
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,280
and i just thought i'd show you a um

1001
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,200
a project unbuilt a guggenheim museum in

1002
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,520
guadalajara

1003
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,720
in mexico unbuilt um but

1004
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,520
i would imagine this is somewhat the

1005
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,400
kind of

1006
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,440
uh moves they would have done this was

1007
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,960
done before rhino had subdivisions it

1008
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,280
was probably done in maya or max

1009
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,280
by a new york firm called asymptote

1010
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,319
and this is it from the top view

1011
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,440
a lot of them just kind of guggenheim

1012
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,359
asked for designers to create projects

1013
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,560
that they were never going to build but

1014
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,720
it was i don't know to attract attention

1015
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,560
to a city or funding to a city or

1016
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,839
this kind of uh anyway but

1017
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,839
that's um kind of a cool unbuilt project

1018
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,880
so this is a project that i did uh

1019
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,240
where i did this um my dad said he liked

1020
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,880
these old

1021
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,560
tractors some tractor that was

1022
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,720
a big milestone for moving ahead the

1023
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,920
world of tractors

1024
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,000
when he was a kid he grew up on a farm

1025
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,359
and he said he wanted

1026
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,200
the tractor like which would be a

1027
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,720
collector's item some tractor from the

1028
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,920
1940s

1029
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
by harry ferguson which is the ferguson

1030
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,680
in massey ferguson

1031
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,800
and um so i made him uh for father's day

1032
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,680
or birthday camera

1033
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,160
which i made him the stool which is kind

1034
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,960
of this iconic

1035
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,560
seat shape on that tractor and i

1036
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,040
drew it in 3d max imported into rhino

1037
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,000
which would have been a subdivision

1038
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,480
surface

1039
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,160
brought into an earth surface and then

1040
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,839
sort of subdivided it laid it out and

1041
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,119
cnc'd it

1042
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,880
and there was another version which i

1043
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,160
couldn't find which was

1044
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,079
thinner pieces of wood and more of a

1045
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,200
grid shape

1046
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,160
but um there's that so that the top

1047
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,520
shape in this is created through

1048
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,880
subdivision geometry

1049
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,480
and then the contouring command that we

1050
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,480
did last week and it sort of has that

1051
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,400
sort of

1052
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,520
tractor stool seat

1053
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,599
and now i'm going to try this is my

1054
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,160
attempt i'm not very good at subdivision

1055
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,280
drawing it's a very different skill set

1056
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,599
um but i i try to draw a cat since i got

1057
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,880
cats in the last

1058
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,920
week or two and i have kittens and i'm

1059
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,440
going to jump into software and show you

1060
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,920
kind of how

1061
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,119
to draw in subdivisions

1062
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,240
so um

1063
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,480
this is stuff from previously i'm just

1064
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,400
gonna ctrl a to select

1065
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,920
all and press delete so that we're

1066
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,520
starting from scratch

1067
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,040
um so on this

1068
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,240
menu here this here standard seaplane

1069
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,599
set view display select

1070
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,440
viewport layout visibility transform

1071
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
curve tools surface tools

1072
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,839
solid tools subdivision tools that's

1073
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:38,560
what i'm looking for

1074
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,560
and it goes on so this changes my

1075
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,880
icons on the left hand panel so my

1076
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,319
explode and join are

1077
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,680
gone and different um and

1078
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,240
all of these tools on the top are for

1079
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,480
subdivision shapes only

1080
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,599
um i'm looking i'm going to start with a

1081
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:58,640
box or actually

1082
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,680
let me drag in a picture of a cat so i

1083
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,839
can

1084
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
um

1085
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,480
um from what i understand professional

1086
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,160
modelers would take photos of things in

1087
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,359
real life

1088
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,960
drag them in as pictures and do this

1089
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,480
kind of tracing over

1090
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,599
um process the same as i'm going to do

1091
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,560
here

1092
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,800
um i didn't measure that because i don't

1093
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,400
really care what dimensions this

1094
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,440
is so i'm going to rotate 3d

1095
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,280
and rotate my picture up to be

1096
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,000
vertical and then going to

1097
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,040
type layer um

1098
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,440
change layer change this to

1099
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,880
layer one

1100
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,440
unlock the layer and delete my kettle

1101
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,000
which i

1102
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,240
don't need and

1103
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,920
then i can block that um if you remember

1104
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,160
from last time that the layers is this

1105
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,760
red white blue slice of pie properties

1106
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,040
is here i could have gone properties

1107
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,599
and changed the layer by selecting

1108
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,119
object

1109
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,040
i don't have it locked down but

1110
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,480
selecting the object and then layer

1111
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,160
and change the layer manually there

1112
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,200
so i'm going to lock that layer and i'm

1113
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,040
just going to get rid of layers

1114
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,040
normally i'd actually have layers over

1115
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,640
here on this part of the screen i'm just

1116
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,000
clearing up screen space

1117
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,440
okay so i'm going to start

1118
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,119
by drawing create sub d

1119
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,599
box which if i was to just type it as

1120
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,400
sub d

1121
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,839
box uh and

1122
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:59,119
i'm gonna right click to get out of here

1123
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,839
um

1124
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,839
so

1125
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,440
so i've just drawn any size box

1126
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,560
so uh select the box m enter or move

1127
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,880
enter and just drag it up here so it's

1128
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,319
kind of snapping where i don't want it

1129
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,680
to snap so i'm going to

1130
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,560
turn off some of these uh they're going

1131
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,000
to turn off ortho

1132
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,680
i'm just going to turn off oh snap for a

1133
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,078
while because

1134
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,160
i'm basically trying to move this

1135
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,040
uh solid shape to um

1136
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,839
roughly where the

1137
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,200
roughly where the sort of main body of

1138
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,839
the cat is

1139
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,760
i'm going to look a little bit here

1140
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,200
okay so

1141
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,400
the key to working in

1142
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,000
subdivision is we're going to type

1143
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,839
selection menu or selection filters

1144
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,319
sorry

1145
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,520
and this selection filter can work

1146
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,200
as a tool that you can use in any part

1147
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,640
of rhino but

1148
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,680
it is essential for subdivisions

1149
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,480
you almost can't work without it and you

1150
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,079
need to click this sub

1151
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,079
objects that's kind of grayed out click

1152
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,559
the sub objects from the bottom

1153
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,040
uh and that allows us to say only select

1154
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,880
vertices only select edges

1155
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,040
only slide faces or plug surfaces these

1156
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,240
are all on when you start

1157
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,200
you need to deselect them all and now i

1158
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,960
can sort of

1159
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,800
only select a face or turn that off and

1160
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,839
turn curves on and only select a curve

1161
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,680
and that's because there's so much

1162
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,040
geometry going on

1163
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,040
i'm going to basically flick these on

1164
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,400
and off

1165
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,440
to control when doing so and start

1166
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,480
only control the faces and select shift

1167
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,839
hold down shift to select

1168
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,839
two and select this sort of back part

1169
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,680
and just to show you tab

1170
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,119
on tab off so tab off i get this

1171
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,599
which is the true geometry and then the

1172
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,720
smooth geometry

1173
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,119
so that's just tab on temple in other

1174
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,079
softwares that's

1175
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,079
sometimes known as a modifier turbo

1176
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,520
smooth same thing

1177
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,200
so from the tools up here i find them

1178
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,599
kind of a little bit confusing but

1179
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,920
this one here is subdivide sub d

1180
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,599
requiring a left click

1181
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,559
i could just type subdivide but um i can

1182
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,160
type that

1183
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,359
and you can see that

1184
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,680
it has turned each one of the ones that

1185
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,280
i had into

1186
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,119
or each face into four new faces

1187
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,359
and

1188
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,880
so just to show you um the gumball so

1189
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,880
uh where the grid snap thing is if i

1190
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,599
turn gumball on the bottom

1191
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,599
here's my gumball looking shape and

1192
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,680
if i if i select the blue arrow and i

1193
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,880
just drag it

1194
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,160
it's going to drag and lock to the

1195
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,839
z-axis and uh

1196
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,319
the green one is going to drag it along

1197
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,119
that one

1198
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,079
okay so first thing is i can right-click

1199
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,319
on gumball and i can set

1200
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,760
the um thing to be on the

1201
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,520
worldview which is the xyz of the main

1202
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,240
model

1203
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,720
or the object which is sort of based on

1204
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,720
the normal of the surface so

1205
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,480
that means that it will um line up

1206
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,119
the gumball will reset to the normal

1207
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,079
change at sort of

1208
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,040
really weird angles mostly i want to

1209
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,520
align to the object but

1210
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,440
i can align to the world so now that's

1211
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,119
back to properly

1212
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,839
so if i was to just drag that with the

1213
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:00,240
blue

1214
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,599
arrow that just moves up if i'm to use

1215
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,520
this little kind of curved arc

1216
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,000
that's to rotate which ortho is

1217
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
currently on so it's

1218
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,319
returning a full 90 degrees but if i

1219
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,599
locked up blue

1220
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,520
they're it's going to rotate that and

1221
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,640
you kind of see if i

1222
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,319
tap off what's happening there um

1223
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,920
i'm just going to undo that and uh

1224
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,960
these little squares is to scale it so

1225
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,280
that's going to

1226
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,319
scale it along uh

1227
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,440
the blue axis or the green axis would

1228
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,160
stretch

1229
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,960
so see it's going to scale it so i can

1230
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,000
do all of the

1231
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,960
scale move rotate in each of the three

1232
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,839
axis

1233
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,119
using this uh gumball

1234
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,400
thing here but i want new geometry

1235
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,640
so i'm going to select two faces and try

1236
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,599
extrude

1237
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,240
subdivision

1238
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,480
extrude curve extrude sub d

1239
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,960
enter and then direction z-axis

1240
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,000
and type these two again right-click

1241
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,599
and extrude another time

1242
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,119
and we start to have a tail

1243
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,119
and then we basically want to

1244
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:37,839
select either faces or um

1245
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,440
basically drag them and kind of look at

1246
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,240
this

1247
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,000
front view over here and um

1248
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,240
if i need a kind of curve i need to add

1249
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,680
more geometry so i can do that by

1250
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:04,480
extruding

1251
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,839
and then um another thing i need to know

1252
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:08,240
how to

1253
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,599
do is to insert an edge loop or an

1254
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,280
edge ring so i can select the edge loop

1255
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,839
press enter and then it just adds

1256
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,440
another loop there which

1257
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,160
increases the amount of polygons

1258
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,040
and if i

1259
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,079
this one's slide uh actually

1260
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,720
so if i if i select one edge and then i

1261
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,079
hold down shift to select the second

1262
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,359
edge but i double click it

1263
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:40,720
it should get the whole edge

1264
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,880
and then that can sort of just

1265
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,079
move it it's another way to do it um

1266
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,280
if i turn on my selection filter curves

1267
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,640
edges on

1268
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,839
surfaces off select

1269
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,880
this edge now i can start to

1270
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,640
move basically move the edges

1271
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:15,839
and line them up to the diagram

1272
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:29,839
there's the shift select that edge there

1273
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,280
and i basically just go through the

1274
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,240
whole time

1275
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,079
um turning edges surfaces off selecting

1276
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,200
things and dragging them to kind of

1277
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,598
meet the um

1278
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,359
the background so there's kind of

1279
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,839
um and i would do basically the same

1280
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,520
with the feet because you know run out

1281
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,000
of time

1282
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,079
but um so i would select these surfaces

1283
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,200
do a subdivide on those surfaces that

1284
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,559
creates takes four faces turns them into

1285
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,319
16 select these sort of uh

1286
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:25,839
corner ones and type extrude

1287
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:32,559
and then i can kind of drag that one

1288
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,480
forward and drag

1289
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,839
this one

1290
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,319
backward and it's sort of very different

1291
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,079
from

1292
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,920
this idea of just dragging things as

1293
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,440
opposed to mathematically sort of

1294
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,960
speaking of numbers but if i did want to

1295
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,640
do numbers using the gumball if i

1296
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,559
left click any of these things it does

1297
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,240
ask me for a dimension

1298
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,040
so i could do somewhat accurate that way

1299
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,280
and subdivision modeling takes in my

1300
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,040
opinion well you kind of do these very

1301
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,119
precise objects but it does take

1302
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,040
a lot of time so another command that's

1303
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,079
quite important is

1304
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,200
creasing and

1305
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,720
if i type crease

1306
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,720
and it says select mesh or subdivide

1307
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,839
edges

1308
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,760
and i select this leg

1309
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,119
um and then i just hit enter

1310
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,400
it sort of says that that is um

1311
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,480
sort of flat don't don't don't include

1312
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,319
that into your smooth

1313
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,720
uh into your formula for just smoothing

1314
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,079
everything together

1315
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,420
um in more advanced um

1316
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,839
[Music]

1317
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,680
subdivision software you rather than

1318
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,400
just crease being on or off you can set

1319
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,359
it as

1320
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,040
ninety percent eighty percent you can do

1321
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,040
really nice um

1322
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,119
kind of curved edges but in as far as i

1323
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,720
can tell in right now it's either on or

1324
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,599
off

1325
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,040
um so now i basically

1326
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,559
um do the same just keep doing the same

1327
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,000
thing basically uh extrude this um

1328
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
change direction uh to

1329
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,200
take sentences this way and

1330
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,680
select these two right click and

1331
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,559
direction

1332
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,280
z-axis

1333
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,040
and then i go up and then i'd

1334
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,640
move these in if i select a face on that

1335
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,040
side

1336
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,280
and then select a face on that side and

1337
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,079
i do a scale

1338
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,440
inward that sort of does them

1339
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,480
kind of together um if because the

1340
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,280
the the gumball is centered on the junk

1341
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,280
the selected geometry

1342
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,119
so it sort of brings them in nicely

1343
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:58,240
and um

1344
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,879
and change the direction to x

1345
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,280
and uh because this is looking a little

1346
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,559
bit more dog-wide currently

1347
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,119
but if i basically select all these

1348
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,880
edges select these points

1349
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,760
i um and and match them to this sort of

1350
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,440
background geometry

1351
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,760
um then i would end up with that so i'm

1352
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,799
going to do the uh

1353
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,920
what chefs uh do and say here's one i

1354
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,559
prepared earlier

1355
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,839
and uh

1356
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,720
and uh it's not bad um you can also

1357
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,680
uh when you select something um just

1358
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,480
straight out click

1359
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,680
delete um so i could

1360
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,760
delete that and just creates a big hole

1361
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,799
um i

1362
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,200
could delete the curve and see if it

1363
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,880
splits it in the way that i want

1364
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,480
a lot of time that does create problems

1365
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,000
down the line

1366
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,119
with surfaces but sometimes it's

1367
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,760
necessary

1368
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,040
and that's kind of a cat-like shape and

1369
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,799
basically if you keep subdividing those

1370
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,200
faces you just keep adding adding more

1371
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:09,839
detail

1372
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,160
so that you're doing eyelids and tongues

1373
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:12,960
and

1374
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,680
teeth um but you just kind of you start

1375
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,480
with the box

1376
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,319
and you just subdivide some diet so that

1377
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:19,839
i'd go more detail more detail more

1378
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:20,720
detail

1379
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,680
so that's a beginning to subdivision

1380
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,400
modeling

1381
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,680
i think um drawing a camp is probably

1382
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,799
quite ambitious

1383
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:33,599
um but drawing the thing we covered

1384
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,720
in um this

1385
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,160
uh this kind of shape is probably doable

1386
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,760
just sort of

1387
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,079
doing a bridge deleting a face trying to

1388
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,599
select faces trying to select

1389
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:48,319
uh edges drag them around move them

1390
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:49,920
rotate them

1391
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,200
do not if you can draw a cat or

1392
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,880
an animal of your choice or whatever of

1393
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,090
your choice um

1394
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,200
[Music]

1395
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,960
do it do it so that's probably it for

1396
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,599
the instructional part of this lecture

1397
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,359
so if people want to start drawing

1398
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,400
and ask questions and any questions you

1399
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,280
can think of just

1400
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:16,480
ask i'll be here
