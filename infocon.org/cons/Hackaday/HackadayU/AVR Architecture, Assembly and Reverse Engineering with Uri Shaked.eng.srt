hi

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,200
i'm worry i'm currently working on

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,840
walkway an online arduino simulator

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,480
and also on this skull and this is an

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,080
hardware city friday

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,119
power the 80 tiny 45 chip and while

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,640
working on these projects

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,720
i learned a lot about the avr

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,800
architecture avr is basically what you

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,359
have

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,000
this chip on the arduino uno board so

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,679
hackety and i partnered to bring you

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,479
this class

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,960
about avr architecture assembly and

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,160
reverse engineering

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,920
our goal is to help you start your

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,239
journey into the fascinating world of

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,760
avr internals

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,079
by the end of this class you'll be able

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,239
to write avr assembly code like

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,239
the program that i have here on my

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,480
screen and you'll also be able to

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,000
reverse engineer

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,360
avr code like this code generated by the

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,039
arduino compiler

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,239
and even more we will get very intimate

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,760
with the 80 mega

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,920
data sheet so here's like an assembly

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,799
code example

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,880
and you will be able to read all those

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,799
code examples in the data sheet

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,720
learn about the registers and all that

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,640
stuff and maybe even solve some capture

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,400
the flag riddle yourself

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,320
now if you want to join this class you

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,400
need to know uh some arduino programming

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,159
so digital read digital right

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,960
pin mode uh bitwise operations and also

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,640
have like basic understanding of

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,000
electronics what is an

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,640
led why do you need a register for and

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,680
that kind of stuff

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,520
so i hope you will join us and let's

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,560
hack some fun together bye
