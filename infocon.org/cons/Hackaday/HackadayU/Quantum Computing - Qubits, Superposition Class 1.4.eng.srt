00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,559
[Music]

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,280
welcome

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,639
for joining the tenth session at

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,440
hackaday

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,560
for quantum computing and since last

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
week we had some new community member

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,840
joining so that's

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,519
the session number two for them welcome

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,959
everyone and welcome back

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
so as always i start with this

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,440
slide to show people where to find

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,600
things uh this will be shared

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
on the hackaday project page and

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,559
we gonna spend roughly 30 minutes today

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,160
and talking about gates

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,879
and we also do some coding exercise we

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:49,680
use the

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,000
q sharp documentation and quantum

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,719
cutters

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,000
for the coding exercise

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,199
last class we had this

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,239
introduction of quantum computing but we

23
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,438
also got into some of the conceptual

24
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,720
topics such as superposition and

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,920
we talked a little bit about gates which

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,360
use linear algebra

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,080
to use matrices to control vectors

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,479
and then we also did some coding so all

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,360
this is done

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,840
through the q sharp language today we're

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,960
gonna

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,280
talk a bit more about these concepts and

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,680
code a bit more

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,920
so last time i showed you this block

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,799
sphere

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,159
and i didn't really use it much

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,159
and didn't really explain what block

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,200
sphere is

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,960
but this time we're going to really get

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
into that

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,159
so for mathematics

42
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,720
representations of all kinds of numbers

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,880
complex numbers real numbers we can use

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,880
a graphic way to represent them

45
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,280
so we know that when when we were kids

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
when we started learning math we can

47
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,719
draw a line and

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,119
use set to represent a real number

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,239
then we learn about complex numbers then

50
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,360
you can use these

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,480
two axes to represent a

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,680
number that contains imaginary parts

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,640
so this horizontal axis is your real

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,680
number

55
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,800
and vertical is your

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,400
complex number in terms of vectors

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,840
we again can use a graphic

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,800
representation

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,720
so last time i already showed that

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,080
a state can be written in

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,200
a linear combination of 0 and 1

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
and that is equivalent of saying that

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,160
the state it has a 0 and 1

64
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,280
state in superposition and they have

65
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,599
some amplitude in front of them to

66
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,800
indicate the weight

67
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,560
of these two states a and b

68
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,840
are amplitudes and they just tell you

69
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
how much of zero and how much of one is

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,599
in your system

71
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,319
and we also saw that the state could be

72
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,360
written

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
in a vector so a and b are just the

74
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
element numbers for these two by one

75
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,040
vector

76
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,000
since it's a vector we can represent it

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,120
in the three-dimensional space

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,879
it has a unit it has a

79
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,319
vector it has a length unit length

80
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,840
and you can draw any point

81
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,760
on this sphere to figure out

82
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,840
what a and b are

83
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,599
so because is in

84
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,879
three dimension in the sphere

85
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,159
the a and b are just written

86
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,640
in terms of these angles relative to

87
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
your axis

88
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,439
all you need is basically you have two

89
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,239
numbers

90
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,840
so in fact even though it is a three

91
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,120
dimensional space

92
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,879
the surface of a sphere is two

93
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,720
dimensions so you only need

94
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,238
two numbers to represent this two by one

95
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,600
vector which translates to two

96
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,840
angles you can write any arbitrary

97
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,479
point on the sphere using these angles

98
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,479
so theta is the angle

99
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,680
away from the z axis phi is the angle

100
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,479
away from

101
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,759
the x-axis it's just convention

102
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,160
and it makes it very convenient we we

103
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,280
call this sphere

104
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,960
a block sphere your qubit

105
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,040
can be represented on any point on the

106
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,160
block sphere

107
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,080
and when you manipulate it when you

108
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
change it say you want to

109
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,600
apply a gate that would then change

110
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,040
the number a and b it just means that

111
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,520
you're

112
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,840
changing the location of this sphere

113
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,440
just use a cleaner way to to see

114
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,120
everything again turns out that

115
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,120
your 0 and 1 these special states

116
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,320
exactly the same as classical states are

117
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,680
on these polar extremes of the

118
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,240
z-axis so the classical bits 0 and 1 are

119
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,080
nothing but special cases

120
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,759
in a classical in the quantum

121
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,960
qubit cubic can be anywhere on the

122
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,639
on the sphere and including the 0

123
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,160
and 1. so arbitrary state

124
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,400
is the same equation i showed earlier

125
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,240
you can write

126
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,360
represented any

127
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,800
number of theta and five so zero and one

128
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,639
are just two special cases one

129
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,080
theta is zero so you have the

130
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,479
state all the way up here and

131
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,360
theta equals to 180 when it goes down

132
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,639
here is

133
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,919
one if you can use

134
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,919
a um arbitrary angle two arbitrary

135
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,360
angles to represent

136
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,800
a vector then how you would manipulate

137
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,360
that

138
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,960
vector is to use matrices

139
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,000
you have two matrices one is to change

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,560
the phase phi and the other one is to

141
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,600
change the angle theta

142
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,919
so this is nothing but geometry

143
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,160
so a general rotation you can write out

144
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,199
how it would change theta and phi

145
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,120
you can have three rotational matrices

146
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,160
one is rotating around the z axis

147
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,560
so your phi is changing is rotating

148
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,280
around

149
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,240
z and you can also have a rotation

150
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,039
around the y

151
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,479
axis your theta is changing uh

152
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,520
you can write the same similarly our x

153
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,039
which is rotating around the x-axis

154
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,560
but both uh r x and r y are just

155
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,759
changing theta

156
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,960
and you can even actually just

157
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,000
represent one of them using the other

158
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
two

159
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,280
so this is the arbitrary

160
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,479
matrices and arbitrary vector that tells

161
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,000
you you can

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,039
arbitrarily put any state on the block

163
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,639
sphere and arbitrarily

164
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,759
manipulate and change it but we don't

165
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,759
necessarily need to get

166
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,960
on every single point on the box sphere

167
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,360
so

168
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,599
for computational convenience there are

169
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,360
some certain

170
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,199
locations on the block sphere that we

171
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
like the qubit to be

172
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,639
in it is like

173
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,160
using a set of coins so all of these

174
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,960
coins

175
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,280
you can have a combination of them to

176
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,520
represent any number you want

177
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,000
so you have uh you don't you don't have

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,560
a

179
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,080
coin for say one dollar two dollar three

180
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,759
dollar you don't have one two three four

181
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,520
all of the numbers uh for each uh

182
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,160
one coin for each number you just need

183
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
to have a small set of them

184
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,599
the minimum numbers needed and

185
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,560
make a combination of them to get to the

186
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
number you want

187
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,640
but in in here the coin is just an

188
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,440
analogy

189
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,880
and is only got real numbers

190
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,159
because we only have we probably

191
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,399
we could have some virtual money i guess

192
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,760
but like

193
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,320
we don't have imaginary money but on the

194
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,200
block sphere you can have

195
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,480
any arbitrary

196
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,120
amplitude which can be positive negative

197
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,519
or

198
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,959
complex but the idea is that you want a

199
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,080
small set of

200
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,680
gates to get you to the the points

201
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,440
on the block sphere so here are some

202
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,399
commonly used

203
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,680
gates one is the x

204
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,959
gate they are called

205
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,360
polygates this x gate basically rotates

206
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,720
from your zero to 1

207
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,760
by 180 around the x

208
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,600
axis so you see these amplitudes will

209
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:29,920
just

210
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,959
flip locations

211
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,080
you have y which is

212
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,600
rotating around y is very similar to x

213
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,399
but it adds

214
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,000
on some additional face you then also

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,480
have

216
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,480
a gate that rotates around the z axis

217
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
it doesn't do much other than putting

218
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,680
a negative sign in front of your second

219
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,120
element

220
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,959
otherwise if you don't have the negative

221
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,640
sign it's just a identity

222
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,839
matrix it doesn't do anything

223
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,920
so you should try the math i think i

224
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,440
showed this slide last time

225
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,040
as well that the z and x gates

226
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,720
are special gates

227
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,839
resolved down from those arbitrary

228
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,120
matrices you should try the math to

229
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
prove that

230
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,640
the previous slide was true and also

231
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,839
why the y matrix

232
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,120
can be represented using

233
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,640
z and x so if you just have these two

234
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,160
you don't actually have to

235
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,120
use y

236
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,079
and we also last time showed the hardama

237
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:42,880
gate

238
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,480
also called the h gate it is a two by

239
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,600
two matrix

240
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,519
it has a negative sign for the last

241
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,519
element what it does is to put

242
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,880
uh your zero and one to

243
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,560
the perpendicular locations

244
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,120
and we call them plus and minus because

245
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,079
when you do that

246
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,440
you are splitting the zero into

247
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,160
a superposition of zero and one and they

248
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
have equal weight equal

249
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,440
amplitude so that has a plus sign which

250
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,560
is

251
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,079
simplified and labeled as plus state

252
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,320
and one is also put into a superposition

253
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,959
of zero and one but with a minus sign so

254
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,839
that

255
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,040
that location there is the minus state

256
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,440
so h gate is very frequently used

257
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,079
um you will see it in almost every

258
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,120
algorithm

259
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
and we will see a lot of that later we

260
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,120
also can

261
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,440
divide those larger matrices into

262
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,760
finer grids so say you can take a square

263
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,160
root

264
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,720
or square root of four or eight of the z

265
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,760
gate

266
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,800
and it just rotates um around the

267
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,880
z axis by a smarter angle

268
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,760
these are also very useful gates so if

269
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,000
you

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,200
use these commonly used gates

271
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,399
you can put your qubits

272
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,839
onto locations that are very commonly

273
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,440
used

274
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
so you can use a combination of them

275
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,200
so yeah this is just to go through the

276
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,639
math to show you what

277
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,760
exactly h gates do try this at home

278
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,160
so h gate is putting 0 and 1 into plus

279
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,880
and minus

280
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,920
but if you use those matrices

281
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,760
they are not directly rotating

282
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,079
through this angle it's actually first

283
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:48,959
putting

284
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,079
0 to 1 and then back up to plus

285
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,120
so that's just some mathematical neurons

286
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
you can check if you want to use those

287
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,639
arbitrary matrices for

288
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,760
angle change you will see that this is

289
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,279
how each gate will behave

290
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,480
and an interesting thing about gates is

291
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,839
that

292
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,079
they not only can change your

293
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,000
originally classical bits

294
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,600
into superposition then they become

295
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,120
quantum gates they can actually be used

296
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,079
to you can visualize it as they are

297
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:30,800
changing

298
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
your measurement basis so

299
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,959
i haven't talked about measurements uh

300
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,959
in the last

301
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,519
class yet but people who have taken

302
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,079
previous

303
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,519
sessions they have seen what measurement

304
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,199
does and that's what we're going to talk

305
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,639
next time

306
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,839
so the interesting about

307
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,040
some gates is that they can put

308
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,360
these

309
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,639
states basic states to a

310
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,000
orthogonal location and if you just look

311
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,480
at the symmetry here the plus and minus

312
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,360
and

313
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,519
not different really not different from

314
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,959
zero and one

315
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,800
when you do a measurement using 0 and 1

316
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,120
you would obtain either 0 and 1

317
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,600
as your result but there's nothing

318
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,880
stopping you from

319
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,639
doing a measurement using plus and minus

320
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,760
as your basis so that way

321
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,720
you would obtain results in either plus

322
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,760
and minus they are

323
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,079
exactly equivalent there is a symmetry

324
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,120
in the space so here

325
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,360
is trying to show you let's say if you

326
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
have some cookie cutters

327
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,399
in the shape of zero and one

328
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,680
um they could be you could use the h

329
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,399
gate

330
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,120
to put the cookie cutters in into a

331
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,320
different shape

332
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,760
let's say plus and minus so if you

333
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,320
are using these cookie cutters to

334
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,839
measure your

335
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,320
states then what you will obtain are

336
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,079
either the flower shape or

337
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,360
the star shape they will match to

338
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,600
either of them but there's nothing

339
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,440
stopping you from using a cookie cutter

340
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,360
in these two shapes and then also do

341
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,720
measurement you'll get

342
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,079
results matching these two outcomes

343
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,160
we'll talk about measurements more next

344
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,279
