2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,080
i want to

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,920
first congratulate hackaday for

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,440
launching the hackadayu

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,360
this is the alternative grad school for

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,600
hardware hackers we're very

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,880
excited that during this time where

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,320
people stay at home

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,800
we have all these really interesting

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,560
topics that's offered by hackaday and

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,720
the quantum computing class is one of

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,760
the first

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,800
classes that we started so welcome to

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,440
this

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,680
new uh interesting way of studying

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,399
and i hope that for anyone who's just

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:42,960
joining

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,440
because of hackaday u you can also enjoy

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,039
quantum computing class we have started

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,760
this quite some time ago if you missed

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,120
any of the previous

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,399
classes the hackaday project

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,640
introduction to quantum computing is

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,399
where you can find

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,960
all of the past recording and slides

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
so you can search on hackaday or someone

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
can post a link here hey megan

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,080
i'm actually gonna make you the

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,759
code presenter so megan can

30
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,080
also monitor over here

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,280
cool the class is

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,479
every sunday we talk about 30

33
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,040
minutes and sometimes it goes a little

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,600
over

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,520
we also started doing coding exercises

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,880
in the class and

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,040
we have some time for q a as well at the

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,079
end

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,360
the documents that we use are from the

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,759
microsoft q sharp documentation

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,640
and the coding exercises are from the

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,799
quantum cutters

43
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,960
for people who haven't seen this before

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,240
you're going to see this live we're

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,280
going to do some

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,880
coding exercise together

47
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,120
now we in the previous classes have

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,239
had discussed superposition and

49
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,599
interference

50
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,840
which are two of the most important

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,120
concepts

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,760
you need to know for quantum computing

53
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,400
today we

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
are going to discuss entanglement and

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,000
note that

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,959
both interference and entanglement are

57
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:29,680
results

58
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,519
of superposition which is the

59
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,959
fundamental

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,319
nature of a quantum state we always go

61
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:36,879
back to

62
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,840
this picture to think about how

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,840
superposition works

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,000
there's four people who have already

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
seen this this will be a revision for

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,800
you

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,879
for new people if this is a little too

68
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,280
much you can always go back to earlier

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,400
classes

70
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,959
but this one is trying to show you when

71
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,760
you have

72
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,200
a qubit you can represent it with

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,480
addition of two states

74
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
zero and one and they are in

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,920
superposition each

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,480
having an amplitude in front of them

77
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,159
denoting how much of

78
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,200
these zero and one is in

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,720
the overall state their amputee squared

80
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,760
would sum to 1 because their mps

81
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,560
2 squared are the probabilities of

82
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,239
having 0 and 1.

83
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,519
when you have 2 qubits

84
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,640
you will have 4 different configuration

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,400
in the overall state

86
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,040
and if you have eight three qubits you

87
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,360
have eight different

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,840
ways to combine your each individual

89
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,319
qubits so then you know that when you

90
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:48,799
have

91
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,120
n qubits it will have 2 to the n

92
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,159
possible configurations

93
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,360
and what this tells us so previously we

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,080
learned about

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,040
the amplitude and how they can interfere

96
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,159
each other

97
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,640
and this time we're going to look at

98
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,159
this other property

99
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,159
entanglement that's also derived from

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,599
superposition

101
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,400
because you can have superposition you

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,519
can have

103
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,959
different combinations of states to be

104
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,600
in the linear combination

105
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,600
you can put some states in superposition

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,840
for example this one you could have two

107
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,000
qubits

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
and they could be both zero or both

109
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,880
one and

110
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,919
they if you compare the first qubit

111
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,040
in both options they are different

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
and if you compare the second qubit

113
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,040
these two options they're also different

114
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
and the other state you could do

115
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,000
is to have zero one and one zero in

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
superposition

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,120
you compare the first options

118
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,720
for the first qubit they are different

119
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,360
and the second qubit these two options

120
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,840
also

121
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,520
are different so these are actually some

122
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,639
special states where

123
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,960
you basically are eliminating some

124
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,680
options

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
you can for example the first option

126
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,080
is when b and c are zero so you have

127
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
zero zero and one one

128
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,479
your system the second option is when

129
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,800
you just have zero one and one zeros

130
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,280
you eliminate the zero zero and one one

131
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,320
states

132
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,440
when you put them into such linear

133
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,880
combination

134
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,400
these two states are

135
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,840
both entangled states meaning that the

136
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,160
cubits the first qubit and the second

137
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,600
qubit

138
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,320
are in entanglement and what does that

139
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,039
really

140
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,639
mean is the

141
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,039
correlation the the results of the

142
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,560
qubits are correlated

143
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,680
for example for

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,080
simplicity we just put equal amplitude

145
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,400
and this is actually a set of special

146
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,000
states called the bell states

147
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,840
these four states and plus minus are

148
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,400
just

149
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,360
two options with different signs so in

150
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,560
total you have four

151
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,319
states when you have the same amplitudes

152
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,759
for these two options

153
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,560
you can have the bell states

154
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,600
take one of the bell states as a example

155
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,919
say a five plus if you measure the first

156
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,880
qubit

157
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,240
and you get your outcome to be zero

158
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,280
then you would know that the this is

159
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,240
from this state that your measurement

160
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,120
result

161
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,160
is being contributed from

162
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,599
you know that you don't even have to

163
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,479
measure your second qubits you already

164
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,800
know your second qubit will be zero

165
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,919
so if your first qubit is zero

166
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,199
you will get this outcome with a

167
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,599
probability of one-half

168
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,479
if your first qubit when you do a

169
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,120
measurement

170
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,919
turn out to be one then you would know

171
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,240
is

172
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,319
from this state so this one would not be

173
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,440
contributing

174
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,319
you get you don't even have to measure

175
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,919
your second qubit you will know that

176
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,240
it will be the one one state with

177
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
probability of half

178
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,360
so this shows us that the results

179
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,280
of the qubits

180
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,560
are in are correlated

181
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,919
this is what entanglement is you can

182
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,120
equally just do

183
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,840
a measurement of the second qubit and

184
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
you'll find you don't even have to

185
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,000
measure the first

186
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,879
cube but you already know what your

187
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,160
first qubit would be

188
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,840
so this is what this cartoon is trying

189
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,680
to show that

190
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,160
you just if you know that your two

191
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,960
qubits are

192
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,520
entangled you just need to measure one

193
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,240
of them

194
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,560
you don't even have to measure the other

195
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,520
one

196
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,080
this is what entanglement is about

197
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,960
and mathematically you can also prove

198
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,039
that it's the case

199
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,560
we learned from the first

200
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,759
session that you could when you have

201
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,120
two qubits you can write them as

202
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,160
a tensor product

203
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,440
of two separate qubits

204
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,080
if they were separate so if you start

205
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
with the entangled

206
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,799
state like a bell state and you have

207
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,559
this vector

208
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,599
if you want to write them

209
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,399
as a tensor product of two separate

210
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,279
qubits

211
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,279
you will then equal this to this here

212
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,279
but then when you do the math you

213
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,640
calculate

214
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,240
the each element what they would be

215
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,880
and and see this four equations you

216
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,480
wouldn't be able to

217
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,600
derive any result so

218
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
this set of equations would not have any

219
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,760
solution

220
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,440
which means that you cannot describe

221
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,080
this whole vector using two separate

222
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,320
qubits

223
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,040
that's mathematically how you can prove

224
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,240
something is

225
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,279
entanglement is that if they were not

226
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,920
entangled you would be able to describe

227
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,360
them as separate qubits

228
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,000
but if they are you wouldn't be able to

229
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,680
there you won't be able to find

230
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,600
the solution there are a lot of

231
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
misconception about

232
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,640
entanglement if you read any popular

233
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
science articles or like

234
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
some media coverage sometimes people

235
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
will say

236
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,720
quantum states are weird if

237
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,440
you have entangled qubits if you change

238
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,560
one the other one will

239
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,680
instantaneously change no matter how far

240
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,560
away they're

241
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
from each other and that's really a

242
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,120
wrong statement

243
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,959
because entanglement is not about

244
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,600
instantaneously

245
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,000
transferring change from one qubit to

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,959
another

247
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,839
like this i try to debunk this

248
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,200
misconception here

249
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,120
when you have two entangled qubits if

250
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,839
you manipulate one of them the other one

251
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,920
doesn't get manipulated the other one

252
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,040
doesn't really

253
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,800
feel anything we we know from previous

254
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,079
couple slides is entanglement is why

255
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,800
you are measuring one of them you don't

256
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,560
even have to measure the other one you

257
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,200
would know

258
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
what the outcome of the other one is

259
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,959
because of this

260
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,000
configuration they are being put in

261
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,040
and it's not a function of distance so

262
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
of course when you separate them to

263
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
infinitely far away you're not changing

264
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
anything so this entanglement effect

265
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,279
stays entangled so there are

266
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,720
a lot of misconception in in the media

267
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,200
about

268
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,079
entanglement and how spooky and strange

269
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:58,959
quantum

270
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,440
entanglement is but it's nothing but

271
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,800
just putting your

272
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,040
qubits in the special arrangement and

273
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,480
when you do

274
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,519
a measurement of one you will know

275
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,480
the outcome of the other there are a lot

276
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,040
of

277
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,000
other commonly made mistakes uh here's a

278
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,399
link

279
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,040
if you're interested you can you i mean

280
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,680
you should

281
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,079
take a look at what's being really

282
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,360
wrongly taught in

283
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,800
quantum computing and uh what that

284
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,000
run statement will also violate

285
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,279
is the law of nature this slide we saw

286
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,959
from last class

287
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,000
about the different types of waves

288
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
but here i'm trying to reuse it for

289
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,320
showing you that we talked about

290
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
speed of light being a universal

291
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,240
constant and also we know that

292
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,959
nothing travels faster than speed of

293
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,079
light

294
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,639
if you had two entangled qubit and you

295
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,399
change one the other one would easily

296
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:58,880
take the

297
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,839
shape change that would imply that you

298
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,320
have

299
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,440
you're transferring information faster

300
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,480
than speed of light

301
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,760
and that is not allowed so

302
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,839
that's why that statement is wrong

303
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,120
now we are talking about multiple

304
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,399
qubits and we only learn the gates

305
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,120
in the previous classes that are

306
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,560
applying to single

307
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,839
qubits and we know that uh for

308
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,600
single qubits we have some commonly used

309
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,279
gates like x y z or haramar or some

310
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:35,680
phase

311
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,120
gates those matrices

312
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
are the gates that are applied to a

313
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,560
single cube

314
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,760
and knowing that a single qubit is

315
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,800
a one by two by one vector and you just

316
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,399
use a two by two matrix

317
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,000
to change them but when you have

318
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
multiple qubits you can also use

319
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,959
matrices

320
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,760
to apply to them and we're going to talk

321
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,720
about

322
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,680
how that's done next and these we

323
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,240
haven't

324
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,240
talked about for people who were in

325
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,720
previous several classes they have seen

326
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,519
this but

327
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,880
for the new set of classes we haven't

328
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,839
talked about these

329
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,079
symbols yet and these are called the

330
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,560
circuits

331
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,279
gates and components using a circuit

332
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,800
representation we

333
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,800
i'm going to show you how that works so

334
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,079
here is one of the most commonly used

335
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,279
multi-qubit gate actually two qubit

336
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,040
gate is the c nut is called a control

337
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,079
knob gate

338
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,399
for people who are familiar with the

339
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,680
classical

340
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,240
not gate it's basically a flip between

341
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,360
zero and one

342
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,839
so i think in classical there's also

343
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:50,480
control

344
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,880
not gate so basically what it's saying

345
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,680
is uh

346
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,839
if you have a control qubits the control

347
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,519
qubit would

348
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,600
determine what happens to the target

349
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,320
qubit which is your second qubit

350
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,199
it's reflected by this matrix here you

351
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,959
see the first quadrant here

352
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,399
is a identity matrix so nothing changes

353
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,160
but then the last quadrant is a switch

354
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,240
so if your control qubit is a zero

355
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,680
then nothing happens to the target qubit

356
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,839
but if your control qubit is a one your

357
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,959
target qubit would either change from

358
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,000
zero to one or change

359
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
from one to zero here is the

360
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,000
outcome definitely try this at home you

361
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,800
can see

362
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,240
that when your first

363
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,360
qubit which is a control is zero

364
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,079
your second qubit is intact but then it

365
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:46,639
flips

366
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,160
when your first qubit is one

367
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,279
so use this matrix and apply it to

368
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,120
your four by one vector which is

369
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,680
two qubits and try to prove this

370
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,079
yourself

371
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,160
well i'm here actually writing this

372
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
proof for you for the one zero case

373
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,000
so go back and do this for people who

374
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,680
don't remember how to do matrix

375
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,440
multiplication this is how how it works

376
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
just apply the elements to your vector

377
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,000
1 by 1 cross plus

378
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,360
and we used a block sphere

379
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,480
to describe qubits graphically

380
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,199
kind of a easier way to visualize what

381
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,880
happens to your qubit

382
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,320
but then we know that is only

383
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,279
useful for single qubits when you have

384
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,880
multiple qubits

385
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,320
the block sphere is not useful anymore

386
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,079
because block sphere

387
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,440
is in three dimensional space

388
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,600
but when we have multiple qubits is

389
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,959
multi-dimension we

390
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,120
cannot represent it doesn't really help

391
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,040
us since humans

392
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,680
can only see up to three dimensions

393
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,959
but we can still use a graphical way

394
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,240
to represent multiple qubits

395
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,199
which is using this lines i like to make

396
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:15,519
this

397
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,600
analogy like music notes which are

398
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,880
these lines that tells you that it

399
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,160
evolves with time and now here instead

400
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,079
of having the music notes

401
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,519
we can connect different qubits

402
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,079
so each line is a qubit but then we can

403
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:34,959
connect them

404
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,160
through some gates and lines for

405
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,560
c not gate the dot is denoting which

406
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,000
qubit is your control and this circle

407
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,720
cross

408
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,759
is a target

409
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,720
and if you also just when you try the

410
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
math you you realize that this

411
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,000
circle not is exactly

412
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,040
x gate is a flip

413
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,280
so this circuit here shows

414
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,959
a target b is controlled

415
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,280
by your the first qubit a

416
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,919
so this is the input this is the output

417
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,559
after

418
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,359
the c notice

419
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,880
so there are also more commonly used

420
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,760
gates and a lot of them use controls

421
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,640
ctrl z

422
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,080
and this is a control c naught so

423
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,679
they're

424
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,600
all multiple dimensional

425
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,280
matrices so you can go and

426
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,520
try to see this mathematically how it

427
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,480
works

428
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,120
but we're gonna delve a bit deeper with

429
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,080
control not

430
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
and why are we talking about control not

431
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,760
here because

432
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,520
that's how you can create a

433
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,840
entanglement in yours in your qubit

434
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,320
system and

435
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,640
is using everything that we've learned

436
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,320
so far

437
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,918
here the

438
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,160
oh i want to turn on the pen so that we

439
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,039
can

440
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,160
do the math together here this simple

441
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,960
qubit

442
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,000
is this simple circuit is

443
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,640
exactly producing a bell state

444
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,799
just using a harder mark and a c not you

445
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:31,760
get that

446
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,880
this is the table of input and output

447
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,360
so we should try doing an exercise i'm

448
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,240
going to

449
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
draw this with my mouse here so say

450
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,440
you first start with let's pick one of

451
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:45,840
them

452
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,960
just to make it more interesting let's

453
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,320
make the first qubit

454
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,960
one so what happens when you apply this

455
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,559
h gate to your first cubit so nothing

456
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,080
happens to the second one

457
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,039
you can just write

458
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,039
that result

459
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,440
we know that when we apply harmon to

460
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,760
either zero or one it puts it in this

461
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,360
superposition state

462
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,240
so when one has a hard amount applied to

463
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,760
it you get the minus sign here

464
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
so you can write this out step by step

465
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,799
with it with matrices but

466
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,640
because we already know what the result

467
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,320
is we don't even have to

468
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,360
derive and write out the matrix but for

469
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,919
people who are super super

470
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,440
curious and rigorous you can also prove

471
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,919
this

472
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,360
by writing out the matrices oops

473
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,880
this is wrong sign it should be the

474
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,480
tensor product but it really is

475
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,520
just showing that you can write your

476
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,080
system

477
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
like now your first qubit becomes a

478
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,400
superposition and your second

479
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,360
qubit stays the same then when you apply

480
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,000
a c naught

481
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,440
apologize for this ugly writing with my

482
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,760
mouse

483
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,200
now what happens then is you just keep

484
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,960
writing

485
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,840
based on your

486
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,200
control qubit now your control cube if

487
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,360
it is zero then nothing happens so you

488
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,760
just

489
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,840
copy that

490
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,799
minus sign doesn't change but now if

491
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,960
your control cube is one

492
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,159
you know your second qubit will becomes

493
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,360
one that's how you derive this table so

494
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,400
go back home and try proving the other

495
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:50,799
ones

496
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,240
you will see with these four different

497
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,919
inputs using a hard mark and a c

498
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,240
naught you would get these four

499
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,840
different belt states

500
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,080
that's quite neat and we can actually

501
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,320
use entanglement in some simple

502
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,679
algorithms this is a super dense coding

503
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,120
algorithm

504
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,400
let's look at the story here uh

505
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,520
we are writing we're representing

506
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
everything using the circuit here

507
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,520
it's so simple so that we can just write

508
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,320
out

509
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,400
what gates are needed to each qubit

510
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,440
so you start with this h naught uh

511
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,720
h hardamagate and c naught

512
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,039
and we know we just saw that this is

513
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,080
trying to entangle

514
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,480
these two qubits so addis and bob

515
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,320
prepare their qubits

516
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,440
into an entangled pair say they start

517
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,720
so that say this is the bow state that

518
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,360
we

519
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,400
they put their cubits into then they can

520
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,159
separate themselves

521
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,440
infinitely far away it doesn't matter

522
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,559
now alice wants to

523
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,840
to tell bob some classical information

524
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,039
she wants him to have a string of two

525
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,320
classical bits

526
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,720
so zero zero zero one one zero or one

527
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,600
one

528
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,799
but she has a qubit in her hands

529
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,280
how does she do that she can encode

530
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,080
these

531
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,760
information into her own qubit

532
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,000
and she's got different options if she

533
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,039
just wants to send 0 0 she doesn't have

534
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,200
to do anything to her qubit

535
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,960
but if she wants to change send

536
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,640
say the first bit to be 1

537
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,080
then she applies that gate to

538
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,360
the first uh to her qubit

539
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,840
if she wants to have the second bit to

540
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,880
be one

541
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,400
she would apply a x gate to her qubit

542
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,840
now she only has one cupid she can apply

543
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,240
either or and both

544
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,679
gates to her only one cubit

545
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,440
depending on what two classical bits

546
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,000
she wants bob to get out so she does

547
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,720
some some

548
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,919
encoding here now she can send her

549
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,240
one cubit to bob bob has two qubits

550
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,200
and we know that

551
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,799
they're still in entangled and he would

552
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,520
have

553
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,360
these four vowel states with him

554
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,840
so if he then disentangle them

555
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,559
and that's just doing a reverse of a c

556
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,280
naught and

557
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,640
a h gate he would then separate

558
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,080
the two qubits if he measures his two

559
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,960
qubits

560
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,640
he will get either zero zero zero one

561
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,400
one zero or 1 1 based on

562
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,760
what alice did to her only qubit

563
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,360
because we know they are still in

564
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,039
tangled bob would

565
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,640
have one of the four options

566
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,960
after he disentangled them that's uh and

567
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,880
then measure them that's the decoding

568
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,640
step he will get what alice intended

569
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,679
to send him there's a

570
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,799
nice little algorithm to show

571
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,039
the usefulness of entanglement and

572
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,559
entanglement only in this

573
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,120
algorithm we have a couple more

574
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,720
algorithms that we're going to do next

575
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,000
teleportation

576
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,960
chs each game they're all demonstrating

577
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,840
tele

578
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,919
entanglement but the more fun

579
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,640
algorithm and more useful ones are using

580
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:36,960
both

581
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,120
entanglement and interference so we're

582
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,080
gonna do those

583
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,559
a little later so in the next couple of

584
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,480
classes we will do some

585
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,960
exercise of the other entanglement

586
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,279
demonstrations

587
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,240
for anyone who complete any quantum cut

588
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,360
up

589
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,840
you should take a photo and screenshot

590
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,480
and i'm

591
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,679
giving people this certificate that they

592
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,480
can print

593
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,159
on anything so you can follow these uh

594
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:04,640
tweet

595
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,080
tweets uh these handles tweet them

596
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,640
with your screenshots or use linkedin so

597
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,520
i know

598
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,080
you have finished cutters so you you get

599
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,679
rewarded with the

600
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,880
printable vector graphics nice to see

601
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,120
people have already done that

602
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,080
also i'm giving this certificate to

603
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,600
anyone who participates

604
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,320
in decoding contests is happening right

605
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,799
now

606
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,840
so register and do the exercises maybe

607
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,760
you can win some awards

608
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,000
in the next day or so we also have this

609
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,440
quantum actual quantum development

610
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,320
workshop actual quantum is our cloud

611
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,960
service

612
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,080
so everything that we learn in

613
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,440
q-sharp using the quantum development

614
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,559
kits

615
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,039
they can be used to run quantum program

616
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,400
on the cloud azure is microsoft cloud

617
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,520
you can access real hardware through

618
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,960
the cloud service we're doing a

619
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,640
developer workshop

620
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,320
that is mid july register now

621
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,360
and to learn more about how you can

622
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,400
use the actual quantum service and

623
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,039
how you can develop yourself as a

624
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,840
quantum programmer
