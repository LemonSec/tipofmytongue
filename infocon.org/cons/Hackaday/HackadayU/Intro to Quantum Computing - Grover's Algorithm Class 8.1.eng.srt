[Music]

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,040
so

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,880
for anyone who are here

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,239
um who have attended previous classes

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,560
this is the eighth one and kudos to

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,640
people who have been keeping coming to

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,279
this

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,480
classes as the materials are now getting

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,680
harder

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,359
i really appreciate that people are

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,160
staying this and

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,040
be able to keep exploring quantum

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,760
computing

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,120
together for people who just

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,480
joined today we have this

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,399
sunday class which is held by hackaday

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,000
and we have everything that's posted

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,280
on the hackaday project

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,399
i have the link here for

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,120
past recordings and slides you can find

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,879
there and i also make announcements

22
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,359
there

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,480
about new features

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,240
and projects that microsoft

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,280
does and my colleagues do they also have

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,560
very interesting

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,000
film projects which i also promote there

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,920
so every sunday we will do a 30 minute

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,960
presentation of one topic

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,040
we were not trying to overwhelm people

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,159
with all

32
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
things quantum so we got to do just one

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,000
concept and we discuss it for 30 minutes

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,159
and we have questions at the end people

35
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,759
can ask in the chat or they can

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,960
mute themselves to ask questions yeah

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,159
um we have some references that

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,040
we've been using one is the microsoft q

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,560
sharp documentation that's

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,799
where all the explanations of

41
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,000
q sharp the language how do you code how

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
do you use quantum computing you can

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,560
find there

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,200
we also use the quantum catalyst which

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,439
is a very nice set of

46
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,000
exercises you can familiarize yourself

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,280
to practice on these topics that we

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,319
discuss and

49
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,879
before i forget uh i think for next

50
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,599
class

51
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,040
i would do a recap for previous topics

52
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,720
as the content now get

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,800
getting more advanced we

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,760
some of the new people may find it

55
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,720
difficult to

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,760
follow even though there are past

57
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,800
recordings so i will be doing

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,959
i'm planning to do a longer session next

59
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,720
week and then

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,440
probably through a different channel so

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
pay attention to the hackaday

62
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,560
projects how this will be broadcasted

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,840
will be announced there

64
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,280
last class we talked about deutsches

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,879
algorithm and doj

66
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,200
hosa artisan and i showed this that we

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
have a list of interesting

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,879
and historically discussed

69
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,080
algorithms that we may

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
discuss in this class so today we're

71
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,319
going to talk about gruber's

72
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,360
algorithm which is in my opinion

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
very funky very very cool

74
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,720
and is a algorithm that

75
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,840
helped us search any particular item

76
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,599
in a unordered list

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,519
but before we go there i remember this

78
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,400
slide from

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,000
last class i hand sketched this

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,519
interaction for deutsches algorithm

81
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,319
i think we want to do a recap here

82
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,400
because there's some concept that we

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,680
would reuse today and also

84
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,159
i think it was quite fast last time when

85
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,599
i went through this so i

86
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,239
would like to walk people through

87
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,879
the basic again for deutsches uh

88
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,720
deutsches algorithm which is a

89
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,080
simplified version of um

90
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,599
deutsche hozar algorithm and

91
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,640
what it does is having a

92
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,918
gate h gate

93
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,279
for the input qubits

94
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,320
and then we have a output

95
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,520
qubit y but why are we calling this

96
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,240
input and output is because when we set

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,360
up this

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,880
this algorithm we introduce

99
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,520
how we would do it classically and

100
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,199
classically

101
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,479
the input is

102
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,840
this one input with

103
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,440
a function which will reduce which will

104
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,880
then equal to

105
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,080
the output y the function f of x

106
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,560
is what we want to figure out but then

107
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
when we want to set up the same

108
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,440
problem with a quantum algorithm we have

109
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,680
to change the order the way we

110
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,880
construct them and we would put this

111
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,000
a this is a

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,600
oracle also known as a black box

113
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,400
where you put into a quantum algorithm

114
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,000
and what this does is that given the

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,199
nature of f of x

116
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,560
we would have

117
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,680
this algorithm one run once and be able

118
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,479
to know

119
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,560
what f of x is in terms of whether it is

120
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,840
a balance function

121
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,759
or it is a constant function i notice

122
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,600
some type pose here

123
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,759
i would i would change them after the

124
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,759
class

125
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,080
and if you still remember

126
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,639
this circuit diagram and i also made

127
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,919
a com a more complicated deutsche hosa

128
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,840
algorithm

129
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,039
that basically what

130
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,639
we're doing here with the y is to have

131
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,680
a negative sign introduced so

132
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,919
if you start with zero having an x and

133
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,280
an h will

134
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,840
put it in a superposition that has this

135
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
negative sign here

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,800
and this negative sign is used

137
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
throughout the algorithm

138
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,240
to be carried over until

139
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,479
the end there are four

140
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,880
states in superposition but these

141
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,319
negative signs the

142
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,840
effect of this negative sign would

143
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,600
create a destructive

144
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,880
interference for the plastates

145
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
leaving your system with only the

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,280
negative states

147
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,960
and then when you do a measurement

148
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,800
you will get from the minus

149
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,160
you will get one after the age

150
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,919
and measurement there this is

151
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,930
how they will behave with a

152
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,960
[Music]

153
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,080
balanced setup when you

154
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,319
are entangling these two

155
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,440
qubits but if you don't entangle

156
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,160
these two qubits this negative sign will

157
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,639
not

158
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,759
have any effect and it would just

159
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,599
not interact with this other qubit

160
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,120
and uh and it would pass

161
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,039
both of them will pass straight through

162
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,880
without doing anything and then that

163
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,440
in that case you get a zero here and

164
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,479
that's when

165
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,000
your f of x is a constant

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,919
function so all i'm doing here i'm just

167
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,639
trying to

168
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,720
show you the power of this negative sign

169
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,360
carried through this whole circuit here

170
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,160
so in deutsche deutsche's algorithm or

171
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,240
deutsch hosa algorithm we've seen

172
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,599
how this negative amplitude can be used

173
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,000
to do a destructive interference

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
next we're going to see how we can even

175
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,520
use the negative

176
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,000
amplitude to enhance the signal that we

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,199
want to

178
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,520
find

179
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,639
this is the guru's algorithm is

180
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,680
introduced by love goover who

181
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,958
is an indian-american computer scientist

182
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,159
this is how the circuit

183
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,719
looks like is a little more com

184
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,000
complicated than

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
the deutzer algorithm but again it

186
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,640
also has an oracle in it but then an

187
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,399
additional box we're gonna see what

188
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,440
what these two things do

189
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,519
and then the rest of them are the same

190
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,959
as the

191
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,518
deutsches hosa orgasm

192
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,040
the setup looks like this when you're

193
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,959
thinking about it classically it

194
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,160
would have some inputs which are labeled

195
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,200
as x

196
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,000
and then it goes through a function and

197
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,200
then gives you an output

198
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,360
if you draw a truth table so this is

199
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,360
basically what this algorithm can do

200
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,720
is there are only two

201
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,760
outcomes for the outputs

202
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,080
and all of them will be zero but only

203
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,760
one of them will be

204
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
one and this is an

205
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,120
on unordered list it could be

206
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,360
there could be a one anywhere on this

207
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,480
list

208
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,680
so in this case here we just um

209
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,200
arbitrarily give one to the input woman

210
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,720
zero here

211
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,600
and this is what gruber's algorithm

212
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,480
trying to find

213
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
is to figure out which of this input

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,040
is given as this one here

215
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,920
and that's to figure out the nature of f

216
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,319
of x

217
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,320
and already showed

218
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,399
the oracles in earlier pages

219
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,000
um so if we want to change this

220
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,120
classical setup

221
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,560
into a quantum algorithm setup then we

222
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,279
would need

223
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,120
to have a oracle like this

224
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,040
and then you have the inputs

225
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,320
and one output at the very bottom

226
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,320
so in gruber's algorithm

227
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
we need some articles or a black box

228
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,279
that could capture these truth tables

229
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,480
so say if we have a black box

230
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,240
for 110 for this truth table

231
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
what it has inside is basically

232
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,600
uh all these input qubits

233
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,880
being a control

234
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,000
for the last target qubit which is our

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,399
output y

236
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,079
and what does this do what

237
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,880
what does it control all of these the

238
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
other inputs being the control for the

239
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,560
last qubit

240
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,959
it is

241
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,240
very similar to what we learned in c

242
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,839
naught

243
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,360
where remember when we have a c not gate

244
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,399
the first qubit is our control second

245
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:46,959
qubit

246
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,920
is target and then the matrix would look

247
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
like

248
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,639
one one but then the other two flip

249
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,920
so then if we have additional

250
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,200
qubits being the control your matrix

251
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,760
will be

252
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,040
just all the way zero but then the last

253
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,079
one will be a flip so by the way this

254
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,519
is tofoli gates i didn't discuss last

255
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,480
time but

256
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,200
now i'm showing you is the control c not

257
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,079
gate

258
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,399
and then you can have a lot more you can

259
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,680
have

260
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,959
more control qubits

261
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,440
all it does is to have a really big

262
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,480
matrix with

263
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,519
all of the diagonal being zero being one

264
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,279
except the very last bit

265
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,560
so now when you have four qubits in the

266
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,760
system if the

267
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,440
first three are the control

268
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,959
then your matrix would be

269
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,839
just one

270
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,440
one more element added

271
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,360
so that tells us if

272
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,480
all of the

273
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,839
it will only affect

274
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,240
the last qubit if all of the half cubic

275
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,320
above qubits are one uh yeah a one

276
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,600
when any of them is zero

277
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,639
it wouldn't do anything to the last

278
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,839
qubit it would be intact so

279
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,200
then if your x 0

280
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,320
1 2 is 1 0

281
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,040
you need to flip the last qubit so

282
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,639
that's why there is a

283
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,800
x gate here so that it will become one

284
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,839
in order to affect this cupid

285
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,920
and then after the black box you will

286
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,800
just flip it back

287
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,160
this is a gross

288
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,279
black box or oracle for one zero but

289
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,240
then you can have

290
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,519
other options like you could

291
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,040
uh have this is 0 1 0 but then you could

292
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,680
have

293
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,279
say 0 1 0 and all you do is to

294
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,880
just add the x gates to those

295
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
qubits that were originally zeros but if

296
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,279
you don't have

297
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,760
any zero if you're you're beginning with

298
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
one more one

299
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,079
then you don't have to have any xk8 so

300
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,240
that that's it that's

301
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
our code that you need in the groupworks

302
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,800
algorithm

303
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,440
but then the complete gurus algorithm

304
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,120
looks like this

305
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,279
it has that oracle but it also has

306
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,880
an additional set of gates

307
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,760
and we're gonna show you this later but

308
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,959
then let's just

309
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,519
look at it step by step what is this

310
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,560
whole circuit doing

311
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,480
so we always start our circuits

312
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
with initialized qubits to be zeros

313
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,320
so then when you are starting up

314
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,800
even though you have three qubits in

315
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,079
your system

316
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,079
and you could have all these eight

317
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,040
states in superposition but then the

318
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,000
first one

319
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
when you start with only the zero zero

320
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,920
zero will have

321
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,040
the amplitude and it will be one

322
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,480
and we're using uh n equal to three as

323
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,240
just a proof of concept uh in real case

324
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,920
and could be really large

325
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,880
but three is a good number it's not too

326
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,199
uh

327
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,040
too few if only two it doesn't show much

328
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,920
but it's not too large otherwise uh we

329
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,399
can't

330
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,440
we can't really show things nicely like

331
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,160
this

332
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,519
so we just use n equals to three so

333
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,560
that's your

334
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,839
um all the possible

335
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,120
states so then when you apply

336
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,639
the h gates you would

337
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,160
then equalize all of the probabilities

338
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,079
for all these gates so all of them will

339
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,399
be then in the superposition of zeros

340
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,600
and ones

341
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,279
so in total

342
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,560
you have all these eight states

343
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,320
in equal probability

344
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,680
so that's what this initial part does

345
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,800
um and i haven't talked about x

346
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
uh the x and h gate on the last qubit

347
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,959
that's very simple that's what we saw

348
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,680
earlier in the

349
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,880
deutsches algorithm so

350
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,519
all you do with this last qubit is

351
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,480
introducing this

352
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,440
negative sign so

353
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,920
what happens when you have this negative

354
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,040
sign going through this article here

355
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,839
remember that

356
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,160
if these first three

357
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,320
cubits are one then it will flip

358
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,360
the last qubit

359
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,959
and that negative sign gets carried

360
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,919
to whatever this black box is set up for

361
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,559
so in this case this black fork box is

362
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,439
for

363
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,559
one zero one so

364
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,599
that's why we have this x gate for

365
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,959
the zero initial zero qubit

366
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,000
so this negative sign gets used to

367
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,039
make this particular amplitude

368
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,840
negative that's really interesting

369
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,880
and what happens next

370
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,320
is kind of repeating this but then using

371
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,840
a slightly different

372
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
setup

373
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,760
so look at this other part here

374
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,320
it looks very similar to this one but

375
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,360
then

376
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,840
it has x gates for all of the

377
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,320
qubits and also

378
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,039
having an x gate in front of the the

379
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,120
last qubit

380
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,160
so just ignore anything earlier

381
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,799
ignore everything else just look at this

382
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,679
part

383
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,600
what does this do is that saying again

384
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,440
only when these three qubits becomes

385
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,080
zero that becomes one it would

386
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,080
make a effect on the last qubit

387
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,360
so this requires that if you want to

388
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,400
have these x gates in front of them then

389
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
they better be zeros before coming into

390
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,720
this box

391
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,840
then they can apply to the here

392
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,480
so if you do the math i i showed it here

393
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,880
i reduced all of the mass for the other

394
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,679
parts but this part i wanted to show

395
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,799
that

396
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,799
remember earlier what happens to this

397
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,480
one is

398
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,760
it makes that 1 0

399
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,039
1 state negative

400
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,840
so this does the same thing it makes

401
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,520
whatever

402
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,000
state that is zero zero negative

403
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,480
so you have this negative uh

404
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,120
amplitudes introduced but but then

405
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,679
this x gate for the last qubit would do

406
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,960
a flip

407
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,240
so everything will be flipped so

408
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,600
initially this 0 0 will have the

409
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,280
negative amplitude

410
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,640
but then after this flip

411
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,520
comes in this one will become positive

412
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,919
and all of the rest will become negative

413
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,440
all of the other possibilities so this

414
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,640
this box actually just does exactly the

415
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,480
same thing as this one

416
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,760
it flips the sign for

417
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,799
the the one that initially would have

418
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,200
zeros in them

419
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,200
so this one flipped for one zero one

420
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,480
this one flipped for zero zero zero

421
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,520
but then this x here

422
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,559
then reverse it makes everything else

423
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,440
negative but um zero zero zero positive

424
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,159
okay so that's what this box does but

425
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,440
then we have all these

426
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,360
h gates around

427
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,240
what do they do interestingly

428
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,600
when i showed you a few

429
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,760
sessions ago about um each gate

430
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
there's something i i left out i didn't

431
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,360
mention so

432
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,039
i explained that the h gate

433
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,760
is changing your 0 to plus

434
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,880
this is the block sphere and then from

435
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,159
1 to minus and

436
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,000
so one way to think about it is

437
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,640
that if you start with these zero or one

438
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,679
states

439
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,280
um these are like classical states

440
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,840
but then applying each gate can put them

441
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,120
into superposition

442
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,200
in those middle states so then that is

443
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,080
a showing you some quantum state with

444
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,679
superposition

445
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,600
so that's what i discussed before

446
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,200
but what i left out is that you can also

447
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,120
think about it as

448
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,720
swapping axes for your qubit

449
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,760
so initially you have these 0 and 1 as a

450
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,720
bases

451
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,760
but due to symmetry here there's no

452
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,360
reason you can't have

453
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,760
the plus and minus be your

454
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,039
bases so doing an

455
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,480
each gate to your qubits has an

456
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,640
effect to swap your qubit spaces

457
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,200
to its perpendicular axis

458
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,679
but this is only for one qubit when you

459
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,919
have a more complex

460
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,600
multiple qubits then

461
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,880
you have to think about this

462
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,520
multi-dimensional space

463
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,320
beyond three dimensions um that's not

464
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,120
easy to

465
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,360
think about but you when you get used to

466
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,880
it you realize

467
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,240
all what the h gate does is to

468
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,280
flip whatever input

469
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,280
by a perpendicular angle

470
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,640
so when you have a

471
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,679
three qubit system you will have

472
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,360
all these eight bases

473
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,240
and they all come in with a amplitude

474
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,840
and what these h gates do is that

475
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,480
it finds where the mean value is

476
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,159
and then flip using the mean value

477
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,120
all of the amplitudes with it so in a

478
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,919
way this

479
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,960
one cubits block sphere does that

480
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,520
already

481
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,960
is flipping from this axis to this

482
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,320
axis but then when you have multiple

483
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,000
states you're finding where the middle

484
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,400
ground

485
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,679
is which is all the the mean

486
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,000
value of all the amplitudes and then you

487
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,679
do a flip

488
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,000
this is really cool so what happens is

489
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,880
that

490
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,600
all of the other amplitudes got smarter

491
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,400
here

492
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,559
but then that one that was previously

493
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,679
negative

494
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,440
got even larger so it picks out

495
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,559
the signal from the

496
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,320
state the black box was set up for

497
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
and there's other way to represent this

498
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,600
so previously i

499
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,240
was showing you only the the amplitudes

500
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,159
but then you can also use

501
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,159
so block sphere is a way for you to

502
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,279
think about

503
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,240
this um three-dimensional geometry but

504
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,600
now we have

505
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,159
eight dimensions we can't really think

506
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:06,880
about

507
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,240
a real geometry there but we can still

508
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,720
use arrows to show the same thing

509
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,159
so is another way

510
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,679
to show you that previously your

511
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,919
if your basis was the normal zero

512
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,520
states then when you do a flip

513
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,360
it is reversing along this axis

514
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,159
but then when you do an h gate you could

515
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,919
change your bases to a completely

516
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:36,559
different

517
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,960
um sorry this one here completely

518
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,120
different

519
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,039
uh vector so then when you do a flip

520
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,240
it is going from here to there and that

521
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,039
one there

522
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,960
is the answer you want to get so when

523
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,000
you are doing this kind of flip this

524
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,120
arrow is approaching this answer more

525
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,760
and more

526
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,960
so if you do it again um

527
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,120
you can flip along this axis

528
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,600
and put this arrow here but then do

529
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,919
another flip with this axis then

530
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,400
your arrow would end up there so even

531
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,840
closer to the answer

532
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,799
so this is what the the next few steps

533
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,200
do

534
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,120
is that they do a repeat they iterate

535
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,320
between these two boxes

536
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,679
so if you do that one again

537
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,960
it puts this amplitude to

538
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,400
negative again and you do

539
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,400
this reflection over mean box

540
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,720
it will make the other ones even make

541
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,640
them negative but then make this

542
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,480
huge so imagine so now that we finish

543
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,200
our circuit

544
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,360
basically um but then

545
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
this is very easy to show with three

546
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,440
qubits but imagine you have

547
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,240
even more qubits you will need more

548
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,559
iterations to get this peak higher and

549
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,960
higher

550
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,760
and yeah so that's what i already

551
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,880
showed so that's how

552
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,400
growers algorithm does the search

553
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,279
the advantage of it is that it becomes

554
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,960
more efficient than a classical

555
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,960
algorithm so you think about how

556
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,799
we do this classically if we have a list

557
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,919
and to find which function gives us

558
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,960
the one we have to check every single

559
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,760
one of them

560
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,080
unless you if you're lucky the first one

561
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,840
will be will have the one then you will

562
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,279
find it in one step

563
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,039
but if you're unlucky it might be the

564
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,200
last

565
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,520
input so you would do

566
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,679
uh two to the n times classically

567
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,799
but then groupers would shorten it to

568
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,520
the square root of two to the n

569
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,559
so it's actually easy to

570
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,240
prove this if you use that

571
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,000
vector arrow notation there's actually a

572
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,640
pretty

573
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,600
uh straightforward proof on wikipedia so

574
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,399
you can

575
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,240
use that so that's why i'm not showing

576
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,440
here is quite

577
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,679
well explained there's so many different

578
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,720
ways of

579
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,000
explaining gruber's algorithm so i

580
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,159
aim to be the one that uses cartoon to

581
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,039
explain it

582
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,640
so if you want to find other ways to do

583
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,559
it there are so many on

584
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,679
line and in fact i'm going to point you

585
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,960
to some of the

586
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,320
really useful exercises

587
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,080
that we have in the cutters and i think

588
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,919
because guru's algorithm is so funky and

589
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,200
i think it's really interesting to

590
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,159
try them by hand so we probably should

591
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,240
do another class just to code

592
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,360
and to to express gruber's algorithm we

593
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,320
actually have

594
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,279
uh several different ways to practice

595
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:07,679
and

596
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,880
get better intuition for groovers

597
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,279
on the cutters we have this building

598
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,120
your groovers algorithm from scratch

599
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,000
which is this link

600
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,360
here so that is showing you like what i

601
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,320
did

602
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
taking apart the circuit and showing you

603
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
each step applying different gates

604
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,440
and building up the black box

605
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,240
this is one way to start from scratch

606
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,679
but we also have

607
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,640
some implications of google's algorithm

608
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,520
and

609
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,880
some interesting using plot to visualize

610
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,600
it

611
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,960
but we also have a fun

612
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,080
repository from my colleague maria who

613
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,559
did

614
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,679
a decorating christmas tree using gross

615
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,720
search

616
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,840
um this was out this is out of season

617
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,320
but this

618
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,720
was written during christmas time so it

619
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
was really

620
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,640
nice okay so i'm finished with the

621
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,200
growers algorithm for today

622
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,840
i want to point people to this very

623
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
exciting event that's coming up next

624
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,240
week

625
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,279
which is microsoft build is our

626
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,320
developer event and this year we are all

627
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,200
online

628
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,039
and it's all free to attend so we have

629
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,080
several quantum talks

630
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,880
from my colleagues at different times in

631
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,919
order to

632
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,440
um show this to people from different

633
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,480
time zones

634
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,520
so there are some repeats here uh if

635
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,360
you're registered there you will be able

636
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,440
to find the schedule and add them to

637
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,600
your calendar so these are the quantum

638
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,679
talks i would love you guys to

639
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,799
look at and we also gonna do some really

640
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,399
exciting announcements

641
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,000
including the work that i've been

642
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,240
working on that we're gonna launch

643
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,080
during build so make sure that you

644
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,640
watch these talks and follow these two

645
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
twitter accounts

646
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,240
they will make really cool announcements

647
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,520
that you would like

648
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,200
to know okay so

649
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,960
just a reminder that you can still

650
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,880
submit your

651
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,080
catas so now we have discussed

652
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,399
deutsches algorithm deutsch hosa

653
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,559
gruber's algorithm so you can pick some

654
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,080
of these more advanced topics

655
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,960
and do cutters but feel free to to work

656
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,720
through some of the earlier ones that's

657
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,240
more basic

658
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,840
and follow these steps and you get

659
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,080
a vector graphic where you can print out

660
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,039
anything

661
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,559
someone who finished the cutters

662
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,880
got the certificate from me and he

663
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,760
printed on

664
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,880
a mug which looks really nice

665
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,080
and of course we have this history

666
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,200
quizzes you can also

667
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,760
participate and get the certificate too

668
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,840
which is the out of the box thinker

669
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,799
certificate

670
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,120
and we probably gotta have come up with

671
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,320
more

672
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,840
okay so this is for today
