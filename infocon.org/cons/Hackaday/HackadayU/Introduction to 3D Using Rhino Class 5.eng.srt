2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,480
all right hello everyone

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,080
welcome to our last class we're um

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,280
going to talk today about a lot of the

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,640
things we've done previously

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,760
and then add to that by talking about

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,680
how to export files from rhino

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,000
to useful applications

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,359
and most of what i use it for is

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,840
creating rhino files for fabrication for

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,880
illustration

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,360
for rendering and then less so for

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,520
virtual reality and gaming but you could

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,559
do that if you want so

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,000
the first thing about exporting is to

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,559
know some file types

17
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,000
rhino files are.3dm and

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,879
grasshopperfiles.gh which we've used

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,399
already

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,039
i guess we could divide files into ones

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,640
associated with software that are

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
private and ones that are kind of a bit

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,760
more open

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,640
generally compatibility with lots of

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,359
softwares

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,479
is like

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,320
dxf which is more of the open file

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
created by autocad

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,119
is going to be a lot more compatible

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,000
with smaller softwares and

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,080
able to get files around easier than

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,520
some of the more private

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,720
files then some of the

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,400
file types are sort of updates or

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
upgrades that

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
increase the capability of certain types

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,000
of files so a dot step file dot

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,439
stp is a sort of successor of a

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,560
igis file iges and

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,479
um some of these have some interesting

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,079
histories i just files

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,000
go back to the us military and um

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,680
object files are like stl files but they

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,320
allow

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,799
materials and textures and things like

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,000
that so

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,840
dot stl files is the main 3d printing

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
file that

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,600
does not allow textures and color

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,920
and then with success or the successors

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,200
that dot amf

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,280
which is the additive manufacturing file

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,439
but generally with file types

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,280
if i'm going between different softwares

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,439
i just like to trial an error

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,720
see if it works sometimes the geometry

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,080
doesn't go through on a certain file

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,440
type and then just try a different file

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,200
type and it probably will work

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,920
um in the pep cure example that i'll

61
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,360
show you guys later

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,120
that i went through on a few file types

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,640
and it didn't work and then dot stl

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,120
works

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
so sometimes it's just whatever

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,480
works so when we're looking at

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,879
file types they're going to transfer

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,480
different types of information and not

69
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,599
transfer others

70
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,959
so the questions are can it store

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,200
nurbs curves can it store nerve surfaces

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
can it serve poly surfaces can it store

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,360
meshes subdivisions does it have

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
textures materials lights animation

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,640
rigging

76
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
object properties groups layers low file

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,959
size so for rhino files

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,280
that animation and rigging is not really

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,680
a rhino thing that's more of a

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,720
sort of maya or 3d max thing so

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,480
that won't save from the other soft

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,200
person come into rhino

83
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,640
if we look at illustrator at least the

84
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,239
way i use illustrator

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,640
that it's mainly just for putting curves

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,280
across

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,040
that you don't really bring full 3d

88
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,040
models into illustrator

89
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,680
and luckily groups and layers stay

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
intact when moving

91
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,840
to a aai file and if they didn't that

92
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,400
would be

93
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,760
really problematic because i'll show you

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,640
on some examples later

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,120
so to start back to this building casa

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,720
de musica

97
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,840
in porto and portugal and i created a 3d

98
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,400
model

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,440
of that building and

100
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,000
i want to just mention that if we look

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,599
at this

102
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,640
3d model in any of the 2d views

103
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,200
it's still 3d geometry that if i click

104
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,879
on any of those points

105
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,040
uh to snap to them they're very much

106
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,080
three-dimensional

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
they are not on the same plane but

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,840
sometimes i want to export

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,280
a two-dimensional drawing um

110
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,959
so i'm make 2d is is a very very useful

111
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,000
uh command and when looking at any view

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,799
it will project what i see to a

113
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,239
two-dimensional curved

114
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,280
drawing sometimes these curves are

115
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,040
grouped in strange ways

116
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,560
so they sometimes need some editing but

117
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,759
make 2d is how i go from a 3d model

118
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,520
to to say give me the two-dimensional

119
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,960
projection of that

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
and it always sort of ends up at the

121
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,800
origin point

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,880
zero zero zero so that there's my two

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,840
dimensional

124
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,320
uh front view that's a that's sort of

125
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,600
the 3d model

126
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,960
and then if i make 2d now i have

127
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,479
a two-dimensional projection of that

128
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,160
that's curves and i can

129
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,360
save that as a a file and export that to

130
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,160
illustrator

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,199
or somewhere else and then in

132
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,120
illustrator i can do stroke widths a lot

133
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,560
better

134
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,600
and start um coloring it in and

135
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,560
i like uh illustrator models with zero

136
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,520
stroke with

137
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,479
with the uh the colors filled in so

138
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,600
that's just

139
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,639
me with a fill command just filling

140
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,680
each color manually that's not a render

141
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,440
and there's a three-dimensional model

142
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,560
so make 2d is great for diagrams here's

143
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:18,800
an

144
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,160
example of gary ingalls and they want to

145
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,720
propose

146
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,199
a big space that goes on the roof so

147
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,960
each one of these would have been drawn

148
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,280
in rhino possibly on different layers

149
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,600
and then that's the the proposal to

150
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
take over the rooftops of this famous um

151
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,240
shopping

152
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,400
store and then here's another example

153
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,919
that i did for a t-shirt

154
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,520
where um you can do any font in rhino

155
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,759
drag in custom fonts so this is a rubik

156
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,759
from google fonts collection

157
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,039
and if you explode a font it turns to

158
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,280
curves so that now they're they're just

159
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,479
nurbs curves

160
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,520
and then i just extruded those curves

161
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,440
drew some roads between and

162
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,880
messed around with the camera settings

163
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,639
that i'm going to talk about later

164
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,680
to to sort of create this

165
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,759
perspective view with a wide angle lens

166
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,440
and then that was brought into

167
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,200
illustrator

168
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,960
[Music]

169
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,040
did some fill on the top and then

170
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,319
[Music]

171
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,160
that was ready to go for a t-shirt which

172
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,680
was my local running club when i lived

173
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,240
in new york city

174
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,840
so another um fantastic software is

175
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
pedicura it's a

176
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,880
less than forty dollars to buy and it's

177
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,880
you can drag any 3d model from rhino

178
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,240
and i used a stl file which wouldn't

179
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,880
transfer over textures but it just

180
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,120
unfolds the geometry and gives you

181
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,460
a very precise um

182
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,960
[Music]

183
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,039
thing to cut with flaps so that you can

184
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,240
cut it out

185
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,520
and assemble it as a sort of paper model

186
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
these lines if you bring them into laser

187
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
cutting is are really really accurate

188
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,960
and you can make very very precise

189
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,759
models

190
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,919
by taking your 3d geometry into pepakura

191
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,440
then bringing it to a laser cutter

192
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,479
afterwards so this is textures on top to

193
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,680
create this dice it's one of their

194
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,280
pre-loaded files

195
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,599
so i did the um the casa de musica model

196
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,440
did the unfold that's what it would look

197
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,880
like in papakura

198
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,319
did the unfold and this is the geometry

199
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,240
uh here and

200
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,919
that would be great for laser cutting

201
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,160
and i'm just going to get out of

202
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,759
this uh pdf and to show you in pepura

203
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,360
so this is their animation showing how

204
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,560
this 3d would unfold you can see it kind

205
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,720
of

206
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
unfolding

207
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,520
and i've seen some people use um

208
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,680
very very detailed grasshopper models

209
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,520
with the most intricate parts

210
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
bring it into pepakura and then laser

211
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,800
cut them and have these

212
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,000
really really precise models that

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,479
would be impossible just to figure out

214
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,160
the unfolding patterns otherwise

215
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,919
and you can kind of drag and drop if you

216
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,199
want a different uh

217
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,039
unfolding pattern it just sort of moves

218
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,560
across

219
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,559
the page so winter craft is a company

220
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,240
that makes um

221
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,919
different animals as masks you can

222
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,919
download them for a couple dollars each

223
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,360
but if you wanted to make your own you

224
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
would make the 3d model and then use

225
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,599
peptura to make the unfolding pattern

226
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,360
of these kind of masks

227
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,920
so this is a standing desk i designed

228
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,200
and this is a

229
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,560
make 2d on the side view and the sort of

230
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,640
perspective view

231
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,440
and there's make 2d colored in from

232
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,560
illustrator

233
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,560
and i kind of went back and forth

234
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,480
using a nesting software to make

235
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,640
the most efficient standing desk i could

236
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
possibly think of so i wanted

237
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,880
two of these to a eight foot by four

238
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,120
foot sheet

239
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
and this is an example of what

240
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,200
rhino nest which is a quite pricey

241
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,480
plug-in

242
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
for rhino it's about a thousand dollars

243
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,600
but

244
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440
there are openness that i haven't tried

245
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
but i might try soon

246
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,519
as a free alternative and you can kind

247
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,240
of see that

248
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
you select any curves that you have

249
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,399
drawn that can be anywhere in the model

250
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,680
and you first set your stock

251
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,640
size so i'd set it to a eight foot by

252
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,480
four foot or two four four zero by one

253
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,399
two two zero millimeters

254
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,040
and then in millimeters uh in

255
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,760
millimeters

256
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,560
um distance item to item so it's it's

257
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,360
going to do that

258
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,200
distance item to sheet that's the border

259
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,040
on the edge in case i've got some

260
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,880
screws or some holes down to hold that

261
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,000
material down that i don't want the

262
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,399
router bit to go anywhere near the

263
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,519
screw because that would damage the

264
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,440
router

265
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,480
freedom do i want the curves that are

266
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,399
going to be

267
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,440
put into this nest to stay their

268
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,240
orientation

269
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,480
or they can rotate 180 degrees or they

270
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,519
can be free

271
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,560
and rotate any direction

272
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,120
and some of these nesting cartons to

273
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,680
minimize

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,760
x because you might use the rest of the

275
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
sheet

276
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,480
and you can kind of do different um

277
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,680
settings on nesting so this is uh

278
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,519
the desk this is the shorter desk which

279
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,079
is three desks to the sheet

280
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,120
and um you probably know the the famous

281
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,399
story of the

282
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,800
uh chess player kasparov who

283
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,959
lost to big blue the the computer by ibm

284
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,240
and a couple years later that they did

285
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,440
the experiment again but

286
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
allowed the computer to play against

287
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,959
the computer and human beings i think

288
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,320
they call that a centaur and the

289
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,839
centaurs one so the

290
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,399
the the humans do what they do best the

291
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,279
computers do what they

292
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,600
do best and as a team they beat

293
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,360
computers pretty easily

294
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
so with nesting there's sort of

295
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,959
sometimes a mix

296
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,240
of human and automated process

297
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,240
for this i kind of changed the design to

298
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,480
sort of maximize the desk size

299
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,120
based on filling the void of this sheet

300
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
so i get three

301
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,200
desks to the sheet and then this is the

302
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
bigger desk with the top piece

303
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,320
two desks to the sheet

304
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,320
and then for cnc files or

305
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,240
laser cut files that a lot of the time

306
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,440
you're just dealing at least from a

307
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
rhino perspective as flat

308
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,560
2d curves so this is a bear shape

309
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,760
and i have them as different colors

310
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,639
so that when i export them they will the

311
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,839
different colors represent different

312
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,480
layers

313
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,839
and when i export them they'll be on

314
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,600
different layers and

315
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,000
i just for the cnc file i want to say

316
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,720
that this

317
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,279
inner blue line i'm going to pocket cut

318
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,480
on the inside which means i'm going to

319
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,120
cut

320
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,920
all the material in the middle and you

321
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,519
set a height for that on the machining

322
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,680
so i set two thirds of the

323
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,880
the stop the 18 millimeters and then

324
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,920
um next up cut uh

325
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,880
on the outside of this red line and cut

326
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,839
again

327
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,040
one third into the material and then

328
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,320
afterwards cut on the oh sorry cut

329
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,720
pocket cut this green area and then

330
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,560
column outside of the red line

331
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,800
which is a profile cut which is going to

332
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,720
cut out the shape and you always kind of

333
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,079
leave to cut the material loose from the

334
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,399
bigger sheet as the last step so that

335
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,320
the material doesn't move around

336
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,560
and then this was the other side of my

337
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,760
little bear shape

338
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,519
which cut on the outside of the profile

339
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,360
cut and pocket cut

340
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
this whole interior two thirds on the

341
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,880
material and this is

342
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,000
uh what i've made this was a sort of

343
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,160
um i wanted a place to put my cufflinks

344
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,920
into this as my wedding favors since my

345
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,279
wedding

346
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,320
reception was in a zoo and there's sort

347
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,279
of a zoomed in

348
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,480
uh thing of this bottom part and the top

349
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,279
part just

350
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,480
snapped friction fitted on to have this

351
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:18,880
little

352
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,760
cute storage space inside and i made

353
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,200
lots of different animals mainly because

354
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,720
my wife asked me to do small animals

355
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,360
first

356
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,639
made a hundred of them and then she's

357
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,320
like no no i prefer big animals so then

358
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,279
i made

359
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,279
another chance we'll get tons left over

360
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,200
and this is where nesting comes into

361
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
really useful so

362
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,600
they're all on different layers which if

363
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,560
i had to manage

364
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
manually select those curves in a cam

365
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,920
software which

366
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,360
in my opinion is not the most user

367
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,040
friendly it would take forever and i

368
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,000
probably made

369
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,160
a thousand errors where as long as

370
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,360
they're on different layers

371
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,639
i'm saying pocket cut the purple layer

372
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,839
do the profile cut two thirds the way

373
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,040
down the sheet on

374
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,240
the red layer and so on um and then

375
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,079
these shapes are obviously rotated

376
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,000
because i allowed them to be free rather

377
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,839
than fixed on the nesting settings

378
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,839
and i set a a rather wide distance

379
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,279
item to item and a distance on the edge

380
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,240
so that

381
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,920
i've uh hold down screws on the edge

382
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,040
and there is an example of the crack is

383
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,480
left behind

384
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,000
and if you guys see the camera here's

385
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,839
real bear

386
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,839
so for laser cutting a lot of the time

387
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,959
you're looking for the same thing you're

388
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,079
looking for two-dimensional

389
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,839
geometry and most laser cutters are not

390
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,320
the most sophisticated interface and

391
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,240
you're just going to set the

392
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,560
the speed of the laser and the power of

393
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,680
the laser

394
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,440
and if you set a um

395
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,920
a high speed and a low power you're

396
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,279
going to just etch

397
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,800
the material and if you set a high power

398
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,639
and a low speed you'll cut all the way

399
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,279
through

400
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,360
and you kind of learn off different

401
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,880
power and speed settings for different

402
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,720
materials

403
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,160
and that's how you can operate a laser

404
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
cutter so you really just need

405
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
two dimensional curves and you're either

406
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,279
cutting uh

407
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,360
the raster inside of the curve kind of

408
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,120
like a pocket cut on cnc

409
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,160
or you're cutting along the profile

410
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,519
um and this is a really cool project

411
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,360
where it's called there's no place like

412
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,880
home because these

413
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
shoes they don't have a screen but they

414
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,480
have gps built in

415
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
and on one shoe they've got four led

416
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,000
lights

417
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,079
in a line and on the other shoe they've

418
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,160
got like eight led lights in a circle

419
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,320
and you tell the shoes beforehand where

420
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,199
your home is

421
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,360
and you click your heels together and it

422
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,120
says one mile two mile three miles and

423
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,720
four miles and in that direction

424
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,639
and sort of guides you home with this

425
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,759
really

426
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,440
low tech interface but i just love the

427
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,959
laser cutting on the bottom

428
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,360
of these little drawings and they've

429
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,040
just drawn

430
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,199
i think the laser there you go and

431
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,360
here's an example of a laser cutter

432
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,560
and um just need these as curves

433
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,079
and then set the cut speed

434
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,360
and the or the speed and the power

435
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,959
to cut through this material and i'm

436
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,040
going to get lazy better

437
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,639
also important with laser cutters or any

438
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,560
of these machines is what the maximum

439
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,279
dimensions are

440
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,320
because you're obviously going to need

441
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,560
to to make your files to fit within

442
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,320
the machine's size

443
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,360
for 3d printing there's lots of types of

444
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,959
3d printing

445
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,079
these are machines by formlamps which

446
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:36,639
was

447
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,519
came out at mit's media lab and they

448
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,480
used a process called

449
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,959
inverted stereo lithography and better

450
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,320
known as sla

451
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,680
and when they did this project on

452
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,120
kickstarter they did i can't remember

453
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,320
exactly what it was but it was a couple

454
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,040
million

455
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,920
that the process was still underpatent

456
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,360
and they had to wait two

457
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,279
years at least before they could ship to

458
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,360
backers waiting for the patent to expire

459
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,279
but now they've done the second machine

460
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,399
and third machine

461
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,199
and are doing really really well stereo

462
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,559
photography is a very

463
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,439
precise type of 3d printing generally

464
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,000
considered

465
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,199
very expensive um historically these

466
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,439
machines by formlabs make it still not

467
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,039
cheap but a lot more affordable than it

468
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,119
used to be

469
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,679
and this is a project that makes

470
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,359
extensive use of grasshopper

471
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
by arthur manning manny who was my

472
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,280
teacher of grasshopper

473
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,119
a decade ago when i first learned the

474
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,640
software and this is a 3d print

475
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,160
done on a formlabs printer i think um

476
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
and you can see how thin some of the

477
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,360
profiles are

478
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,480
and hopefully you kind of don't know all

479
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,080
the grasshopper commands to

480
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
to make this but you can kind of see the

481
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
grasshopper grasshopper like

482
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,520
logic to how it's created and with any

483
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,760
3d printing process you're looking at

484
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,880
what is the maximum dimensions of

485
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,679
the print area what is the layer

486
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,200
thickness

487
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,240
and the more layers you have in 3d

488
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,200
printing

489
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,520
the better resolution that 3d print is

490
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,240
going to be

491
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,320
but the longer it's going to take to 3d

492
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,840
print because the machine is

493
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,080
going to make a two-dimensional print of

494
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,200
every single layer

495
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,559
and if you want quarter the thickness to

496
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,160
be more accurate that's four times the

497
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,200
print time

498
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,000
and um that's the decision one needs to

499
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,960
make

500
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,640
minimum wall thickness is really

501
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,360
important when you're 3d modeling

502
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,280
fast 3d printed that's the thinnest

503
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,039
size that a solid object can be

504
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,919
for this particular method and the

505
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,480
thinnest

506
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,640
it can be changes depending on the

507
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,520
method

508
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,799
and they're doing it with uh

509
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,400
somebody who's 3d printing the things

510
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,840
for you they might be a little bit more

511
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,799
conservative and want

512
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,200
slightly thicker uh wall thicknesses so

513
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,880
the models definitely don't break

514
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,080
if you're on your own machines you can

515
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,360
do a little bit more trial and error and

516
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,960
see how thin you can get and

517
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,480
and learn um how to be kind of more of a

518
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,039
craftsman of a 3d printer

519
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,000
this is um an image from a makerbot and

520
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,880
you can see just

521
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,360
layer thickness is thicker on the right

522
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,080
here

523
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,120
and they've done these cats thinner and

524
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,559
thinner and thinner

525
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,840
so this cat would take probably four

526
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,280
times the amount of time to print as

527
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,760
this dab

528
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,640
different processes have a different

529
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,000
profile on the layers

530
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,200
so makerbots are fdm

531
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,520
deposition modeling where the first

532
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,640
printer i showed you is

533
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,640
an sla printer you can see the layers

534
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,200
have this different profile which this

535
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,640
gives a much smoother edge

536
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,440
another type of 3d printing is the zed

537
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,760
court machines which are powder-based

538
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,960
and they work by this is sort of a

539
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,480
gypsum or plaster

540
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,240
and they one of these drums is empty and

541
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,799
one of it

542
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,200
is uh full and the printer will

543
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,880
basically transfer the powder

544
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,200
layer by layer from one to the other and

545
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,880
every time it prints a layer it will

546
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,000
also print

547
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,679
a glue or a binder and when you

548
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,360
do your 3d model it's going to slice it

549
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,720
up by the layer thickness kind of like

550
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,240
we did the contour command

551
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,760
and it's going to be 0.1 millimeter

552
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
layers or really thin layers

553
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,960
and then that's going to be a layer of

554
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,120
powder a layer of glue and go to the

555
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,799
next layer into the next layer

556
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,080
and then at the end you're going to dig

557
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,360
out the 3d model kind of like an

558
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,720
archaeologist

559
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,360
which is basically glue powder from

560
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,640
non-glue powder

561
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,080
and what you pay for is the amount of

562
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,760
powder you remove from the machine

563
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,919
and then as well as that the amount of

564
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,960
glue so it's for the

565
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,720
combo price these are some examples

566
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,000
of 3d models made with zed core uh

567
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
free prints they generally have a

568
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
thicker wall thickness

569
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,960
and are kind of more fragile

570
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,400
um if if if you kind of don't want too

571
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,840
much glue because if

572
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,080
if the more glue you put on these models

573
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,440
the stronger they will be but it kind of

574
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,039
gets a bit tacky looking so you kind of

575
00:20:59,039 --> 00:20:59,679
want

576
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,520
a happy medium but if you don't put

577
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,280
enough on they kind of crumble

578
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,720
um so they are

579
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,640
shorter lifespan than a plastic model

580
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,159
which is just gonna

581
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,520
um not um they're gonna have many

582
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,320
problems

583
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,919
long term with that um the powder

584
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,360
this these are three prints by the way

585
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,280
um they don't really look it but

586
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,159
um this is powder 3d printed with ink

587
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,000
going in so every time it does a layer

588
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
of 3d print it's going to

589
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,679
have ink go in there as well this is

590
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,720
again a zed corp

591
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,400
machine now owned by shapeways

592
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,600
and sometimes people do experimentation

593
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,559
with 3d printing

594
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,280
and this is a cool project by bowling

595
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,799
green state university

596
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,440
where they um so that the zed court

597
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,080
machines

598
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,559
are um kind of like a your packard

599
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,600
business model where

600
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
the ink is expensive for the zed coat

601
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,960
machines the powder is expensive and

602
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,400
you're meant to buy the powder from them

603
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,679
and not use any other

604
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,840
third-party powder so bowling green

605
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,600
state wanted to just

606
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,799
try any kind of powder it wanted and did

607
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,520
ceramics

608
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,280
and glass and just started pushing

609
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
powders through and coming up with its

610
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,159
own

611
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,679
um binders and these were shrink tests

612
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,720
of 3d prints

613
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,960
from a ceramic material that they fired

614
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,159
in the kiln

615
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,400
and uh i think they got in trouble at

616
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,240
first and then

617
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,000
zed corp asked to collaborate and

618
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,440
sponsor them so i

619
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
you know that kind of sort of break the

620
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,960
rules and then get invited to the party

621
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,760
afterwards so

622
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,640
uh and they've sort of filing patents on

623
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,559
uh they also want to compress

624
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,919
every time it does a layer inside the

625
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,240
machine to then compress

626
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,200
each layer because that's better for um

627
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,000
if you want to do

628
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,200
a cup and then

629
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,320
same kind of idea powder plus binder

630
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,559
this is a stone which is crushed into a

631
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,240
powder and then on a

632
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,400
massive 3d printer built up layer by

633
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,520
later um

634
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,679
with a binder that sort of makes the

635
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,039
stem part

636
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,000
and then you dig it out the same way so

637
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,440
when it comes to 3d printing

638
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,400
um in rhino this is a 50 millimeter by

639
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,159
50 millimeter box

640
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,520
if i 3d printed a solid box that would

641
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,600
3d print fine but it would be a lot of

642
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,440
material

643
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,720
and in a z port machine that would just

644
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,640
be a solid box so every single layer is

645
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,440
going to be

646
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,640
a square an open box um

647
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
which is each side of surfaces i just

648
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,559
exploded this box and deleted the top

649
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,280
surface

650
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,600
that won't print at all because as i

651
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,480
said surfaces

652
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,960
have no thickness whatsoever they so

653
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,880
this is a thickness of

654
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,679
zero and it will just appear invisible

655
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,120
to a 3d printer

656
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,919
if i do an offset surface i give it a

657
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,760
thickness so i've given that a 1.5

658
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,400
millimeter

659
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,440
thickness using offset surface

660
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,559
and i i just did um rhinos

661
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,559
p-type volume and you'll get the volume

662
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,200
on shape this is 14

663
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,640
the volume of this cube which means it's

664
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,279
14

665
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,960
of the price and um that could be

666
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,840
25 versus 250 and it's gonna look the

667
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,520
same no matter what

668
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,000
so uh if you turn upside down and it

669
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,880
will look the same

670
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,919
so if we go back to this slide

671
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,360
here if this was an offset surface

672
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,760
with nothing underneath it would be 14

673
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,120
the price of

674
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,320
if i just made that solid

675
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,039
so a very important command with rhino

676
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,320
especially

677
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,360
um to check your precision is

678
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,159
show edges and then do the naked edges

679
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,480
and naked edges are just any surface

680
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,720
edge that is not part of a solid

681
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,000
so in this case all of these

682
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,240
these are exploded surfaces they're not

683
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,279
connected

684
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,960
and therefore all of these are naked

685
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,440
edges where all the edges on the other

686
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,320
two

687
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,919
cubes are part of a solid poly surface

688
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,320
and if i was to explode the box

689
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,480
and um redraw the top square where i

690
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,279
i'm deliberately off by one millimeter

691
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:07,760
that

692
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,880
uh if the surfaces are not joined so

693
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,480
these are all separate surfaces

694
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
and i do the show edges naked edges

695
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,520
analysis

696
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,360
that i'll get pink edges on all the

697
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,679
edges but if i join them i just get pink

698
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,120
edges on this

699
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,320
open part here and that's very important

700
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,080
because that box currently would not 3d

701
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,360
print because it is

702
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,919
an open poly surface and only closed

703
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,400
solid

704
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,320
poly surfaces will print so you kind of

705
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,840
depending on how you create geometry but

706
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,360
if there's any risk that there is any

707
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
imprecise parts you want to do this test

708
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,240
of show edges

709
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,919
naked edges before any 3d print

710
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,880
especially sometimes that if there are a

711
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,559
bunch of parts that are stacked on each

712
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,120
other

713
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,960
and let's say there's five parts the

714
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,240
middle part is

715
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,799
um got a problem and there's there's a

716
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,000
little hole in it

717
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,880
then they will just 3d print without

718
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,520
that

719
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,279
object in the model and you'll have

720
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,640
whatever where it was meant to be one

721
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,039
piece

722
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,559
you now have two separate parts because

723
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,240
the middle part was just invisible

724
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,840
this is super advanced but back to

725
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,559
adam holloway who i showed you that um

726
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,159
colorful minimal surface

727
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,720
um and arthur who did the burning man

728
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,840
temple project

729
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,480
and carl they created this plug-in for

730
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,440
grasshopper

731
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,159
that changed how you do 3d printing and

732
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,840
so it's

733
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
very difficult to understand plug-in but

734
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
it's normally

735
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,679
uh 3d printing is done in horizontal

736
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,960
layers

737
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,159
called slicing and um

738
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,840
a 3d printer needs to go through that

739
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,919
whole horizontal layer before it moves

740
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,240
up and does the next horizontal layer

741
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,880
in this model they've sort of gone

742
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
directly to the g-code

743
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,799
the the underlying code of 3d printing

744
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,480
and said that you can just move the 3d

745
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,919
printer turn the extruder on

746
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,279
and then move up vertically to create

747
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,559
this um kind of twirl piece

748
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,640
and then this side that to create that

749
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,480
geometry that

750
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,840
that's not going to work by horizontal

751
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,679
layers it's going to need to sort of

752
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,440
move up and down and up and down and up

753
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,960
and down to sort of create this weaving

754
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,679
effect

755
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,720
which is quite an interesting uh hack on

756
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,320
3d printing so setting materials which

757
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,440
i'm going to show you when we open

758
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,039
software

759
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,559
that materials are properties for

760
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,520
any object or a surface or polysurface

761
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,440
and there are a lot of preset materials

762
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,840
that are included so you can just select

763
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,679
plastic wood and there's a ton of ranges

764
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,799
of wood

765
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,120
or paint and then set to color and then

766
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,520
you can alter the settings for

767
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,880
transparency if you wanted it for glass

768
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,799
or glossiness which would be turned up

769
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,480
to max for metals

770
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,559
and change around the settings that way

771
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,799
separately there are textures which are

772
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,840
um image files that you scale and you

773
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,080
bring in to the material so this is wood

774
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,840
which has the texture

775
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,080
included in that we're not going to

776
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
cover much on

777
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,760
setting materials and rendering because

778
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,159
it's like a whole horse in itself

779
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,919
then lighting we can turn on i'll show

780
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,080
you lights when we open rhino

781
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,080
which then shadows will appear in your

782
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,120
render view which

783
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
normally there wouldn't be shadows and

784
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,279
you can set environment settings

785
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,760
set what location this model is in the

786
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,600
world what day it is what time it is and

787
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,960
the shadows will

788
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,120
uh sort of match that sort of timing

789
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,320
and then there's just multiple lines

790
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,039
with multiple shadows the lens length

791
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,880
in perspective view can be altered so

792
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,720
this is a 10 millimeter lens

793
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,240
which when i did that harlem round

794
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,640
t-shirt i

795
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,600
had a very small lens length which from

796
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,200
the top which created that sort of

797
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,799
geometry and if the lens length is

798
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,480
very large that you get this more

799
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,600
flat sort of 3d

800
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,000
you can also go to isometric which has

801
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,440
no perspective points

802
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,000
and change your view and then do make 2d

803
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,360
on any of these views

804
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,799
to capture that 2d geometry

805
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,440
and now i'm going to start drawing soon

806
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
with the final project so the final

807
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,399
project

808
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,399
which you guys can all create and get

809
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,480
your certificate when you submit

810
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,600
is to do either a furniture piece or

811
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,399
some object

812
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,520
maybe related to things you're

813
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,840
interested in that

814
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,039
has something from each week that we

815
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,320
learned so it has

816
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,720
something from nurbs curves something

817
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,360
from

818
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,919
maybe solid geometry something that's

819
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,279
subdivision based

820
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,320
something that's grasshopper based

821
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,559
and then maybe set a material and do a

822
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,440
make 2d

823
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,760
or have the files ready to see and see

824
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,520
so you've kind of done something from

825
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,200
each of the five weeks

826
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,440
and i'm going to show you an example of

827
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,520
something that meets that criteria

828
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,240
and it's going to be a sort of refresher

829
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,279
on

830
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,679
the trading geometry in each of the

831
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,120
different types

832
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,960
so as um one just type of geometry that

833
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,080
um was very popular in the 90s and i

834
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,159
still think it's really really cool is

835
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,320
um voronoi and that's where you just get

836
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,520
a bunch of points

837
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,880
and this is just a randomly organized

838
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,640
set of points and

839
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,399
if those points find their nearest

840
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,000
points and create curves between

841
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,080
all their nearest points and then you

842
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,720
will find the perpendicular bisectors of

843
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,799
the midpoints of all those curves

844
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,720
and then trim them all and

845
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,559
then delete the the purple lines

846
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,120
that we get this sort of uh shell

847
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,159
pattern

848
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,880
and uh let's turn off the lights so this

849
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,279
is a

850
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,159
voronoi uh pattern and it's controlled

851
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:46,880
by those

852
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,320
underlying points and i'm gonna do um

853
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,360
use a voronoi pattern which is just a a

854
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,080
ready-to-go

855
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
grasshopper component but when people

856
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,159
were doing this for the first time

857
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,760
in the 90s this was there wasn't a

858
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,039
grasshopper and this was coded from

859
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:01,600
scratch

860
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,480
so in this case this is um a voronoi

861
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,120
pattern

862
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,440
and then an offset from one of the or

863
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,720
every one of the cells

864
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,880
and then rebuilds the curve from a first

865
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,039
degree curve to a third degree curve

866
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,200
um creating this nerve's curve in the

867
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,840
middle and then a planar surface between

868
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,200
those two

869
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,840
and slightly creates these triangles of

870
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,320
various format patterns as well and then

871
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
sends that to a laser cutter and makes

872
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,679
this as a full

873
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,039
wall in the architecture school at

874
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,320
columbus ohio possible

875
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,360
and one of the tools i'm going to

876
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,720
sort of indicate of use in my design

877
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,760
is a bullnose

878
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,799
router bit so in controlling any router

879
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,320
bits from rhino i'm just going to have

880
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,159
profile curves and when you export it

881
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:56,960
you would

882
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,080
sort of assign this router bit

883
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,559
to go along that curve so i just really

884
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,200
need

885
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,760
the the mid curves this is an example of

886
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,240
using

887
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,110
a write a bit like that

888
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,519
[Music]

889
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,200
there and this is kind of what i'm going

890
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,360
to draw so

891
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,880
let's draw the same guys so we switch to

892
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,720
grasshopper and oh sorry switch to right

893
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,399
now

894
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,640
so the first thing i'm going to do is um

895
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,760
start with nerves curves and draw a

896
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,320
rectangle

897
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,800
um with let's say 250

898
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,080
[Music]

899
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,679
so i'm going to create the the legs

900
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,360
first using curves

901
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,159
and i'm going to snap to the midpoint my

902
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,000
snaps are on

903
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,559
and i want a circle exactly that length

904
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,480
and that will snap to that point and

905
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,240
i'll just drag that down

906
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,320
i'm going to use the trim command and

907
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,080
trim both sides and

908
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,760
that's right and then i'll just explode

909
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,320
this curve and delete this bottom line

910
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,080
and then i'm going to join that together

911
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,600
and

912
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:25,279
offset it let's say 15 mil each side

913
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,440
and

914
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,440
i'll just take any point on the side

915
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
um

916
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,200
and just move these two points up uh

917
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,159
let's say 50ml

918
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,120
and there will be a

919
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:07,840
seat here

920
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,000
so

921
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:21,839
let's say um

922
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,000
so i'm just drawing one of the two sides

923
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,179
[Music]

924
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,800
and

925
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,719
i'm going to use a mirror command to

926
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,060
bring them over the other side

927
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,340
[Music]

928
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,839
so now i'm just selecting this and

929
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,239
trimming

930
00:34:48,239 --> 00:35:03,839
various curves

931
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:17,839
add some curds to the bottom

932
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,280
and i'm going to join that to make one

933
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,599
curve

934
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,079
i'm just going to join that one and then

935
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,839
type close curve which will fix the

936
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,240
other one

937
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,000
so there's kind of a stool

938
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,280
leg made out of nerve curves and

939
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,839
um i made a lot of cnc furniture i kind

940
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:56,240
of

941
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,839
know my way

942
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,960
i'm going to basically offset this

943
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,110
[Music]

944
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,400
i'm offsetting that nine millimeter each

945
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,250
side creating an 18 millimeter

946
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,839
[Music]

947
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,440
gap here and then

948
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,839
copy this to make a second one

949
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:42,640
again just trim more sides delete those

950
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:55,839
might point to the midpoint

951
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,480
and then i'm going to trim

952
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,200
top side on one and the bottom side of

953
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,078
the other and they will

954
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:23,839
they will lock together and see and see

955
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,240
so join all those so they're

956
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,960
peace i'm just gonna move

957
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,800
this morning to my origin point since i

958
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,190
like it

959
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,760
[Music]

960
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,400
and just so i need them for 3d is

961
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,200
extrude

962
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,560
curve and both sides needs to be off

963
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,960
and 18 millimeter which is this

964
00:37:50,960 --> 00:38:05,839
thickness of plywood

965
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,920
and then if i just select the extrusions

966
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,010
which are close quality surfaces

967
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,569
[Music]

968
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,050
and

969
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:35,269
[Music]

970
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,800
i can do rotate 3d

971
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,520
and then we'll take this one 90 degrees

972
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,200
and then i'm going to move them and snap

973
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,839
to place

974
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,320
so

975
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,440
if i was just to see and see these

976
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,200
curves and do

977
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,800
a profile cut on the outside of those

978
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,359
curves

979
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,440
i would get from cnc that geometry there

980
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,280
in 3d and now i'm going to create

981
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,200
a top using um

982
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,880
grasshopper and subdivision so

983
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,200
um i want a circular top

984
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,390
and i want it to be

985
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,679
[Music]

986
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,000
snaps so it should be 280 so it's a

987
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,520
radius of 140

988
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,640
i'll just that up out of the way

989
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,760
and voronois are quite interesting when

990
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,680
the like you kind of really

991
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,040
if you mess around with different

992
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,240
underlying shapes you realize how

993
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,000
drawing nature um you just use different

994
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,359
uh curves and um

995
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,400
it creates this very biogeometry so i'm

996
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,880
going to use a spiral

997
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
and i want the spiral to be flat if i

998
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,400
didn't type flat here or didn't click

999
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,119
flat

1000
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,720
it would be a three-dimensional spiral

1001
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,400
it's not to the center point

1002
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,480
the edge of the spiral is going to be

1003
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,920
the edge of the

1004
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,319
seat and its default is set to 10

1005
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,319
turns if i wanted to increase the turns

1006
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,680
i could increase it there

1007
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,520
that's fine and i could do that in

1008
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,880
grasshopper

1009
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,800
if i wanted to do more in grasshopper

1010
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,079
but i'll just

1011
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,599
do a little bit of it so um

1012
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,119
i'm going to open my grasshopper window

1013
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,599
which currently has nothing in it

1014
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,400
and i want to bring that curve in so i

1015
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,880
type

1016
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,920
curve and take this basic curve with

1017
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,280
it's just going to ask me to set one

1018
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,599
curve and i want to set

1019
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,359
the spiral and i want to divide

1020
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,040
the spiral and

1021
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,640
so that's going to create division

1022
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,319
points and currently the number

1023
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,240
is 10 but i will make that a slider

1024
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,480
and set the slider to integers

1025
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,160
and change the limits from

1026
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,800
a minimum of one and let's say a maximum

1027
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,280
of

1028
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,839
a thousand

1029
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,880
and plug that into the number of

1030
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,319
versions

1031
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,359
so now our spiral

1032
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,400
if i move this oh didn't say it

1033
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,839
[Music]

1034
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,839
2000

1035
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,640
so i get a thousand up to a thousand uh

1036
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,680
division points on that spiral

1037
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,400
and i want to do a voronoi which i can

1038
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,040
just type

1039
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,319
uh born away

1040
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,200
and i want those division points where

1041
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,040
the example i showed you on pdf was

1042
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,160
randomly

1043
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,359
assigned points but um

1044
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,920
those points

1045
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,960
and then i want to bring in another

1046
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,040
curve and this time i want to bring in

1047
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,160
uh the circle from the edge

1048
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,440
and i'm going to set the circle for the

1049
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,359
edge as the boundary of the boron eye so

1050
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,160
it doesn't go out

1051
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,359
like the rising sun here

1052
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,800
so now my my voronoi is

1053
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,119
um just so i can see what's going on i

1054
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,640
want to turn off the preview of the

1055
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,680
points

1056
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,960
uh i'm going to hide the

1057
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,480
um edge circle i'm going to hide

1058
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,880
the spiral

1059
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,800
and i might do this in the top view so i

1060
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,440
can see it better

1061
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,280
okay so as i move

1062
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,880
this division points now

1063
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,800
that's basically dividing our spiral and

1064
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,720
automatically creating a voronoi of

1065
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,000
the points that it creates

1066
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,970
so i could even um

1067
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,640
[Music]

1068
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:41,839
turn off the spiral

1069
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,960
okay so what should i do um

1070
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,000
let's do it about there

1071
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,760
and then i'm going to bake that geometry

1072
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,720
so i'll put on a different layer there's

1073
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,200
a layer one

1074
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,599
and now i'm essentially done with the

1075
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,240
grasshopper

1076
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
and

1077
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,280
so when i have my layers open i can

1078
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,400
actually right click

1079
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,520
on layer one and uh

1080
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,599
select select objects and that's just a

1081
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,440
nice way of selecting just what's on

1082
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,720
there and i'll drag this over

1083
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,440
100 okay

1084
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,960
maybe i didn't rotate that properly and

1085
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,520
just fix that later

1086
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,839
so it doesn't many degrees um

1087
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,280
and i want to um show

1088
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,119
because i want this edge circle to go

1089
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,480
with it and i moved it

1090
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,880
uh exactly 400 it's good to move things

1091
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,480
by precise dimensions so that if you

1092
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,839
forget something you can just

1093
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,279
move copy 400 millimeter

1094
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,800
so each one of these cells

1095
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,000
is a closed curve

1096
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,920
and if you remember the multi-pipe from

1097
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,280
the kettle exercise

1098
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,119
i'm going to do a multi-pipe on all of

1099
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,400
these curves

1100
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,839
but i don't want um

1101
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,599
i want to basically one curve in each

1102
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,319
position where currently

1103
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,960
in this one position is this cell and

1104
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,160
this cell

1105
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,800
so i can explode and select all this

1106
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,440
geometry

1107
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,760
i don't need the circle and i can

1108
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,359
explode it all

1109
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,880
and that you can read from up here it

1110
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,119
exploded 142 curves which were the

1111
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,160
closed cells

1112
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,040
into 823 segments which are just

1113
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,400
individual curves

1114
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,920
i want to click off and i can type

1115
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,040
select duplicate or select dp

1116
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,520
which is quite useful in numerous

1117
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,640
situations

1118
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,560
and it's selected 396 duplicates and i

1119
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,680
can just delete

1120
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,839
so now when i click on each of these

1121
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,200
it's just one curve in each one of these

1122
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,319
positions so then

1123
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,079
um i want to use the circle

1124
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,200
to trim these

1125
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:15,839
outer parts

1126
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,079
and i guess if i wanted to spend the

1127
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,359
time i could do the whole thing

1128
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,319
in grassroots but i'm just doing a

1129
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,680
little bit in grasshopper based on what

1130
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:43,839
we already know

1131
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,839
so

1132
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,359
you'll probably get away without being

1133
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,640
so accurate but

1134
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,079
i'm just gonna take the time to probably

1135
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:53,839
follow this geometry

1136
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,730
all right that's close enough and um

1137
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,040
[Music]

1138
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,359
so now i can select all these curves and

1139
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,319
um

1140
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,319
probably the best ideas in perspective

1141
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,800
i'm going to do a multi-pipe on

1142
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,839
the whole thing

1143
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,920
so multiply i'm going to do a pipe

1144
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,280
radius all

1145
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,800
let's try three um

1146
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,319
tap ends off and

1147
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:49,839
one is fine and there we go

1148
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,079
okay so i'm going to extrude my circle

1149
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,200
by um the thickness of plywood that i'm

1150
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,160
going to use a quarter

1151
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,280
inch which should be 18 millimeter

1152
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,720
and

1153
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,819
[Music]

1154
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,590
my subdivision had messed up

1155
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:47,539
[Music]

1156
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:59,839
let's try it again

1157
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,680
so um

1158
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,240
i'm gonna do a bounding box on the curve

1159
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,520
and a bounding box

1160
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,680
on that so i can drag this subdivision

1161
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,640
across

1162
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,000
i could snap to that point and then the

1163
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,800
top point

1164
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,880
of this bounding box

1165
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,200
and now i'm going to use solid geometry

1166
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,380
to boolean

1167
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,200
[Music]

1168
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,598
separate

1169
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,520
that subdivision geometry so i'm going

1170
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,480
to do boolean split

1171
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,839
and

1172
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,520
there's the towel on to turn this on and

1173
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,400
hopefully this will

1174
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,880
separate

1175
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,599
but from controlling a cnc machine

1176
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,040
perspective we actually just need these

1177
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,680
curves and then to assign

1178
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,760
a ball nose router bit which is the one

1179
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,599
i showed you at the end of the slideshow

1180
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,040
to those curves and then it will move

1181
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,400
on the line uh profile cut these curves

1182
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,079
and this would be the end result

1183
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,400
so for c c and c machining you actually

1184
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,800
just need the curves

1185
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:51,359
and um it's going to take a bit too big

1186
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,079
and that's most of it um done as far as

1187
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:54,720
modeling

1188
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,720
goes i'm going to then set some

1189
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,520
materials

1190
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,770
and make 2d

1191
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:04,960
[Music]

1192
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,640
works very well with simple geometry

1193
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,079
sometimes it kind of gets a bit messed

1194
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,920
up with more complex geometry needs to

1195
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,200
be tidied up

1196
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,880
there are a lot of sub settings that

1197
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,480
weren't there in previous versions so it

1198
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,920
might be better

1199
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,839
in mind seven

1200
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,880
this might be better on a faster

1201
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,839
computer but my laptop's a little slow

1202
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,079
if anyone has any questions um

1203
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,839
so i can just delete this top part

1204
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,240
there is my boolean.geometry

1205
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,920
so my hope is to create that as a stool

1206
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,359
top and um

1207
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:18,800
it's got enough points on the stool that

1208
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,839
should still be comfortable

1209
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,520
and we can

1210
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,839
move this to the top so before i make

1211
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:32,000
sure that this is not perfectly straight

1212
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:35,409
[Music]

1213
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,839
so

1214
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:51,359
so now that's better and i can snap

1215
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:54,839
[Music]

1216
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,839
two

1217
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,760
and then uh

1218
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,899
[Music]

1219
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,640
i'm just creating bounding boxes so i

1220
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,340
can snap from one to the other

1221
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:16,389
[Music]

1222
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,440
and then i want to move that down again

1223
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,079
i said it was

1224
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,119
let's say six millimeter

1225
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,359
so that's our stool um when creating the

1226
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:33,920
cnc

1227
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,640
file we would need to pocket cut

1228
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,319
the parts underneath for these which

1229
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:46,079
um one way of creating that geometry is

1230
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,079
to just boolean out from this

1231
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,200
and it'll be i don't know if it will

1232
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,640
slow down my computer again but

1233
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,280
james do you do everything line to line

1234
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,880
for your

1235
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,520
your uh cnc work or do you leave a

1236
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,240
little bit of

1237
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,400
gap a little bit of tolerance or

1238
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,480
clearance in those

1239
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,520
um i need a little bit of clearance

1240
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,720
um how much huh

1241
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,760
how much would you leave it depends i

1242
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,440
mean i usually

1243
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,880
like a millimeter oh sorry

1244
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,040
do you mean on sorry vertically a

1245
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,559
millimeter definitely not on the other

1246
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:35,119
side

1247
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,680
um it takes a lot of i mean wood

1248
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,559
obviously

1249
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,920
plywood can expand um depending on the

1250
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,640
season

1251
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,040
and um it's kind of a trial and error

1252
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,920
process

1253
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,240
sometimes the cnc especially since i use

1254
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:48,960
the shotbot

1255
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,280
is some of the machines are more

1256
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,480
accurate

1257
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,760
sometimes they're a little off so you

1258
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,079
kind of i do like a few tests and then

1259
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:56,960
see how that goes

1260
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,920
and then apply that tolerance to the

1261
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,319
rest of the geometry and then we cut

1262
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,079
i wouldn't sort of take a file and cut

1263
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,359
it directly without

1264
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:08,480
doing a tolerance check

1265
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,680
and i like i guess when i first did it

1266
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:11,950
um

1267
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,200
[Music]

1268
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,559
i just made like

1269
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,319
15 different uh slots and

1270
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,359
like made it in wood and then with the

1271
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,280
wood put it in each of the 15 slots and

1272
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:25,920
and check

1273
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,119
which fit i like the best and

1274
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,720
i guess did it in the real world for

1275
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,559
trial and error and just this one works

1276
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:33,280
the best

1277
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,559
that's cool thanks

1278
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,200
so um just as a last step in the last

1279
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,079
few minutes we have

1280
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,000
um if i just uh

1281
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,119
grab this and let this be

1282
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,440
um so this is properties that we've done

1283
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,880
before layers

1284
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,119
rendering and then the fourth one is

1285
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,400
materials

1286
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,000
if we add a new material and

1287
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,920
kind of see these set materials already

1288
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,520
here i don't think they have wood

1289
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,799
so i need to just go they're still

1290
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,920
in the downloaded file but um they have

1291
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,720
lots of

1292
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,119
more options here so i can select wood

1293
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,240
they have

1294
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,359
all these types of wood

1295
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,680
i want birch but i don't want polished

1296
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,359
birch

1297
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,720
and that adds to my material file

1298
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,559
and then there's a few different ways i

1299
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,319
can do it i can select all the geometry

1300
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:27,920
right click on the material and go

1301
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,079
assign to objects or i can just drag it

1302
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,160
across

1303
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,799
and in ghosted view i'm going to have a

1304
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:35,920
material but

1305
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,319
if i bring it into rendered view

1306
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,920
there we go so there is

1307
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,359
a object that uses

1308
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:48,880
some subdivision geometry through the

1309
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,559
multi-pipe tool some grasshopper

1310
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:51,599
geometry through

1311
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,040
voronoi um it's on a spiral

1312
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,599
divided points some nerves curves for

1313
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,400
the legs

1314
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,520
and then kind of sets it up which i

1315
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,640
guess i haven't totally finished but

1316
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,640
sets it up for a cnc file

1317
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,000
um and we could do make

1318
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,200
2d on this and hopefully in your final

1319
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,480
project file

1320
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,920
you're doing one something from each

1321
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,720
week uh hopefully that makes sense and

1322
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,240
then there should be a place to upload

1323
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,359
your file which i'll send info i'm not

1324
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,720
sure exactly where we're doing it

1325
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,280
but you can send your 3dm file

1326
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,200
or we might just do an image i'll let

1327
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,319
you know

1328
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:37,119
and maybe just describe some of your

1329
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,640
steps there's a

1330
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,920
google spreadsheet actually a google

1331
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,480
quiz that i created already and i just

1332
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,480
you just take a checkbox and say

1333
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,640
my model has nerves my model has

1334
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,920
grasshopper and so um that's kind of the

1335
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,200
conclusion to the course hopefully

1336
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,000
everyone

1337
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,280
if they wanted to create a this

1338
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,559
stool and

1339
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,400
lots of other cool projects and if

1340
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,520
there's any questions now i'm going to

1341
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,559
stay around

1342
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,000
and if you have any questions in the

1343
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,920
following days i'll be happy to answer

1344
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,880
