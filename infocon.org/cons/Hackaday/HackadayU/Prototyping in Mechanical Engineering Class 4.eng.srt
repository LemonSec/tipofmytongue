[Music]

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,400
hey everybody welcome back

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,920
uh this week i'm will fisher i'm

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,440
teaching prototyping and mechanical

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,519
engineering and i am excited that you

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,280
guys are back for week four

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,400
this week is fluids and thermodynamics

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,880
which is going to be super awesome and i

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,560
want to get you guys jazzed for that

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
um just a little bit up here at the

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,240
front with a video

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,439
so i'm going to show you this one this

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,279
is from smartereveryday

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,119
he's a really cool youtuber you should

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,399
check out if you get the chance but this

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,440
is just him

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,320
nerding out about uh about some laminar

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,559
flow jets at the detroit airport

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,600
so uh you can see these around places

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,879
besides that but we're going to talk

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,000
about laminar flow a little

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,920
bit today so anyway glad you're here um

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,000
we'll just cruise right in we got a lot

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,440
to talk about today

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,199
um and so um yeah

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,280
we're going to move pretty quickly and

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,879
i'll talk a little bit about all this

28
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,719
stuff so i'm going to introduce

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,520
fluids and thermodynamics and then we'll

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,959
go into fluids

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,880
and then thermodynamics and then we'll

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,159
talk about all the practical and

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,600
applicable stuff that you guys might be

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,119
interested in after that

35
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,360
so uh why are fluids and thermo

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,960
typically taught together and this is

37
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,080
actually common it's not just

38
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,040
me being crazy here um though i am still

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,080
a little crazy

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,759
um but thermo in thermodynamics

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,920
and stationary bodies is relatively well

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,799
known

43
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,439
it's pretty easily mapped mathematically

44
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,280
the equations all exist and have

45
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,200
solutions and so it's not that exciting

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,640
a thing to really

47
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,079
uh think about so much but fluids really

48
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,240
complicate thermodynamics

49
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,920
in really fun and exciting ways if you

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
love math uh

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,520
and actually in a lot of practical ways

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,280
even if you aren't so keen on math

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,600
but a lot of them uh both of them have a

54
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,720
lot of the same

55
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,960
components showing up from both places

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,000
so things like temperature

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and pressure which we will talk about at

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,360
length heat

59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,040
is a really important part of fluids as

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,640
much as it is about

61
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,360
thermo so the applications also tend to

62
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,560
overlap

63
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,240
if you are trying to cool something you

64
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,520
need to know about how fluids are going

65
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,878
to move around it and if you're trying

66
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,679
to move

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,360
fluids from place a to place b

68
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,520
thermodynamics really matters also

69
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,959
so we're going to talk about all of that

70
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,200
sort of stuff i do want to

71
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,760
give a bit of a caveat today um i know

72
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,360
in the last couple of weeks we've been a

73
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,319
little bit more

74
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,840
on the practical side of the knowledge

75
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,760
things that that i have

76
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,280
picked up from my years of being an

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,040
engineer today we're going to talk a

78
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,480
little bit more on theory

79
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
than we have so the balance is different

80
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,720
we will still talk practical i promise

81
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,519
and don't uh don't forget the theory

82
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,440
that we've learned in previous weeks

83
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,360
because that stuff is really uh

84
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
important as well

85
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,400
so um yeah glad you guys are here

86
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,080
uh let's jump in with a couple of

87
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
definitions a fluid broadly

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
speaking is any material that conforms

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,599
to its container

90
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,800
and so the difference between gases and

91
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
liquids are

92
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,360
by definition a gas will expand

93
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,000
fully into a container whereas a liquid

94
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,599
will not necessarily

95
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,519
um and so the practical applications are

96
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:09,920
there's

97
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
there's two real big differences in the

98
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,760
way you interact with these things

99
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,560
a liquid is typically an engineering

100
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:16,959
world

101
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,879
thought of as incompressible and what

102
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,159
that means is that if you have

103
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,959
liquid in a container that does not

104
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,000
yield

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,959
you cannot compress it past its current

106
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,760
volume

107
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,840
um and and now technically according to

108
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,920
physics it's not exactly accurate but

109
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,519
from an engineering standpoint it tends

110
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,879
to be useful

111
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,200
in that definition it's also something

112
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,959
where all fluids have

113
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,080
some viscosity but you really

114
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,640
you need to pay attention to the viscous

115
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,760
the viscosity

116
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,400
of a liquid whereas with a gas yes it

117
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,239
technically has a viscosity and that's

118
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,519
really important for things like

119
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,319
drag in an aerodynamic application but

120
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:54,799
you

121
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,879
sometimes don't think of it quite as

122
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,480
much when you're doing the numbers side

123
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,040
of things

124
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,280
or even when you're doing engineering

125
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,519
and i'll explain some applications of

126
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,200
why those things are kind of different

127
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,080
as we get further into it gas unlike

128
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,680
liquid is compressible

129
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,720
if i take a syringe and i cap the end

130
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,640
i can still press it a little bit kind

131
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,798
of like an air spring which is another

132
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,399
kind of similar idea cool

133
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,120
let's keep cruising on i want to talk

134
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
about some terms and properties here

135
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,639
i'm showing this image on the right i'm

136
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,479
particularly fond of i took that photo

137
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,639
that's me on a tour of a decommissioned

138
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,080
nuclear power plant

139
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,400
east germany's pride which was super

140
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,759
cool that's not the name of the power

141
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,120
plant but it was a big

142
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
thing back in the 1960s when it was

143
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,240
built super cool

144
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,600
and you should absolutely go and take

145
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,840
the tour if you're anywhere close

146
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,479
um cool anyway that aside let's jump

147
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,120
into

148
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,720
our terms and properties so

149
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,880
pressure is a property of a gas

150
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,639
typically and it is defined as

151
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,800
force per area that it exerts on its

152
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
container

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,919
and that's an important thing but it has

154
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,520
a lot of ramifications

155
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
um as we'll talk about when we get into

156
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
the mathier side of things

157
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,479
and um it's kind of thought of as kind

158
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,360
of like the primary property of your gas

159
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,800
and of your liquid as well it's

160
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,280
important um

161
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
because it will take the pressure of

162
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,759
whatever system it's in

163
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,000
temperature is a material property

164
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,080
technically in physics there's a much

165
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,520
more extensive definition of what

166
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
temperature is but from an engineering

167
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,080
standpoint

168
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,919
we're mostly going to think of it as a

169
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,600
fundamental property of the material

170
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,400
itself

171
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,360
right so yes it has to do with the

172
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
excitement in the atoms and that sort of

173
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,639
stuff but but what i really

174
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,680
care about is is my water

175
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
uh four degrees or is it

176
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,800
25 degrees that's really important

177
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,600
in my application potentially heat on

178
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,320
the other hand

179
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,639
is kind of a measure of the thermal

180
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,400
energy within a material

181
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
and every material that's above absolute

182
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,840
zero has some

183
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,479
amount of energy in it and what's really

184
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,440
important from the engineering

185
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
standpoint isn't the amount of heat

186
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,319
that's already anything but the amount

187
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,360
that it's going to change

188
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,840
over the course of a process so with

189
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,960
respect to pressure

190
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,120
temperature heat all of these things

191
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,400
were mostly

192
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,520
interested in the change from

193
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,160
an initial state to an end state right

194
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
and that's true because

195
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,120
let's say we've got we're cooling a

196
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,960
circuit board application

197
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,720
we need to think about okay so we're

198
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
putting a bunch of electricity into this

199
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,960
thing

200
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,720
it's doing something but it's producing

201
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,080
heat from all the resistance

202
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
we want to meaningfully remove that heat

203
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,319
so we're starting with some amount of

204
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,520
heat flowing in

205
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,600
and we want to successfully flow that

206
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
same amount of heat out

207
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
maybe even greater and that would cause

208
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,120
potentially cooling

209
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
which would be great the next term we

210
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
want to talk about is volume

211
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
and volume is much more useful when

212
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,199
you're talking about gases

213
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,720
for the simple fact the matter is is

214
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
that liquid doesn't compress

215
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,160
and so if you have a closed system the

216
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,759
volume doesn't change

217
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,639
but with gas it can and you may have

218
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,319
purposefully

219
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,720
designed systems that expand the gas and

220
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,639
then compress it and go back and forth

221
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,440
in a cycle

222
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,800
and that's useful in a lot of different

223
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,479
cycles that's used in power generation

224
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,759
and refrigeration

225
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,199
and in your internal combustion engine

226
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,800
and in your jet engine all over the

227
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,280
place

228
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,840
so volume does matter just much more

229
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,639
with gases than it does with liquids

230
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,160
entropy is a fun one people often quote

231
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,800
the law of thermodynamics that is always

232
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,680
increasing

233
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,160
that's true in a universal scale but

234
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,560
within the context of a specific system

235
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,520
um we can change entropy and that has

236
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,319
really fun

237
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,120
applications um again in those cycles

238
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,720
where we're expanding and

239
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,879
compressing things back and forth to

240
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,919
achieve useful

241
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,039
by-products and that's that's true also

242
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,720
like if you think of a deck of cards

243
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,639
if i take the deck out of out of the

244
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,479
pack and i scatter it in the room i have

245
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,000
increased its entropy

246
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
but i can also go and collect those

247
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,120
cards reorder them in the order that

248
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
they came and put them back in the pack

249
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,000
and i have decreased entropy um

250
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,599
by the time the universe is all burnt

251
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,759
out and dead those cards will be long

252
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,240
gone

253
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
and even the molecules within them will

254
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,520
have lapsed into the

255
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,960
inevitable heat death of the universe

256
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,319
but don't get caught up on that it's

257
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,479
depressing

258
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,840
enthalpy is a is a measure that is

259
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,960
a derived property and it's

260
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,680
simply a convenient way of thinking

261
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,360
about the amount of available work

262
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,759
you can get out of a material so you

263
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,960
check in a table the

264
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,000
enthalpy values of steam as you go from

265
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,679
high pressure steam to low pressure

266
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,240
steam

267
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,919
as you're expanding through a turbine

268
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,080
and that tells you how much work

269
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,000
you can expect to get from that turbine

270
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,080
in terms of the rotational energy

271
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,959
to say generate power um or thrust in a

272
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
jet engine something like that

273
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
um and then you know you have some

274
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,080
efficiency in there and that sort of

275
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,360
stuff but if you're designing a power

276
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,000
plant

277
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,320
which gosh i sure hope you at home

278
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
hobbyists are thinking about

279
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,880
um then you'll you'll use a lot of

280
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,440
enthalpy

281
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
otherwise in your day-to-day

282
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,880
applications you may not use it all that

283
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,920
much

284
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,320
viscosity is a really important one um

285
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,120
this one's

286
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,800
more applicable to liquids than it is

287
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,480
with gases but if you're pumping and

288
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,680
piping through a system

289
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,519
viscosity is going to be kind of how you

290
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,120
would think of electrical resistance in

291
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,920
a circuit

292
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,320
um and so you can do things to decrease

293
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,200
viscosity

294
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,360
like diluting with a lower viscosity

295
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,880
liquid

296
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,160
it's also temperature dependent so if

297
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,519
you're finding let's say you're piping

298
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,440
around glycerin glycerin is one that has

299
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,360
highly temperature dependent viscosity

300
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,959
so you heat it up it gets much

301
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,000
more much less viscous or inviscid

302
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,920
which is the opposite of viscous

303
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,640
and as you cool it down it just becomes

304
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,360
sludge molasses is like that too

305
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,040
sugar solutions if you're doing food

306
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,600
stuff that sort of thing

307
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,519
okay cool that's our introduction that's

308
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,440
our glossary of terms so when i go back

309
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,800
to those terms now you know what we're

310
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,600
talking about

311
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,560
let's jump into the real fun stuff that

312
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,279
is

313
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,680
fluid dynamics and that's fluids moving

314
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,720
around

315
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,920
um here's a fun picture

316
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,600
that i grabbed when i google image

317
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,360
searched fluid dynamics i think it's a

318
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,839
car

319
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,440
and somebody's computationally modeled a

320
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,120
thing computational modeling

321
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,959
has come a long way since i learned

322
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,680
about it in the mid-2000s

323
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
you can now find off the shelf packages

324
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,240
including like fusion 360 has some fluid

325
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,440
dynamics packages

326
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,640
which is super cool because it's

327
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,560
available even um

328
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,240
kind of at the hobbyist level and

329
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,519
there's a lot of open source software

330
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,399
out there that does that

331
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,760
i'm not going to talk about the modeling

332
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,200
software as much because it's just not

333
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,640
my specialty

334
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,640
um i am going to talk about the big

335
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,320
three when it comes to fluids which is

336
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,000
pressure volume and temperature

337
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,120
i've already introduced them a little

338
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,800
bit but we're going to get a touch in

339
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,320
more into detail on that

340
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,600
i'm going to talk about flow field

341
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
diagrams which you will see

342
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,959
kind of as the basis of your fluid

343
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,040
dynamics and talk about some of the

344
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,160
fundamentals

345
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,680
of fluids things like the no slip

346
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,160
condition which is really important

347
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,680
laminar and turbulent flow and how

348
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,440
they're different

349
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,240
how those things become drag and why

350
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,600
that's important in your aerodynamic

351
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,480
applications

352
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,279
we'll talk about uh briefly about

353
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,880
conservation of mass and energy how that

354
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,800
impacts your fluids in circuits

355
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,560
the bernoulli effect or newly principal

356
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
as it's called and then we'll kind of

357
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,640
touch

358
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
very briefly on lift and why it works

359
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,240
because it's super cool

360
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,200
um all right let's dive in uh we'll

361
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,640
start with pressure

362
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,440
pressure as i said before is force per

363
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:25,920
area

364
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
it's measured in pascals as the common

365
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,000
si unit um

366
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,399
it's also measured in bar which is very

367
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,440
very similar to one

368
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,800
atmosphere um they're quite close uh tor

369
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
which is a measurement of uh typically

370
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
used more often in vacuum than it is in

371
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,560
pressurized applications

372
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,160
and in the english unit side of things

373
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,640
it's the pound per square inch the psi

374
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,959
um sometimes if you have very high

375
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,560
pressures it's noted in

376
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,079
kilopounds per square inch as ksi

377
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,399
and these units can go up uh as you

378
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,839
would expect with

379
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,880
uh the si units kilopascals is kind of a

380
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,160
more useful

381
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,800
uh measurement for pressures that are in

382
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
the kind of atmospheric range so in your

383
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,360
tires

384
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,480
for your bike for instance when you're

385
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,399
designing for pressure

386
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,120
cylinders and spheres are great you want

387
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,720
to avoid corners and the reason for that

388
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,680
is

389
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,920
nature deals with pressure

390
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,399
by maximizing volume per total surface

391
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:24,959
area

392
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,920
and the highest ratio of surface area

393
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,680
the lowest ratio of surface area to

394
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,720
volume

395
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,040
is a sphere and that's why you see

396
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,399
common in arthropods like the little

397
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,959
ladybug i got over there

398
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,440
and water droplets you see spheres all

399
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,320
the time

400
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,920
cylinders are also common in nature if

401
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,600
you think about things like trees

402
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
um and reeds those things come in

403
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,079
cylinders for much the same reason

404
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,760
you're optimizing that surface area to

405
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,839
volume ratio and the same you want to do

406
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,279
the same thing in your designs when

407
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,120
you're accommodating high pressure

408
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,839
um it's not as important with low

409
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,279
pressure though it is still important

410
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,800
because atmospheric

411
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
pressure is enough that it'll implode

412
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,240
stuff if you get it wrong

413
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,959
so uh cylinders uh particularly rounded

414
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,720
end cylinders like if you think of train

415
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,680
cars that

416
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,160
transport liquids you see that shape a

417
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,760
lot in nature or in

418
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,279
engineered things because that does a

419
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,040
nice job of avoiding corners

420
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,120
you also see it in compressed gas tanks

421
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,399
like you're seeing on the screen those

422
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,519
are oxygen tanks

423
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
those are commonly held um at like

424
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,839
you know 50 times 50 atmospheres right

425
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,600
like a ton of pressure inside those and

426
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,160
they're fine

427
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,639
totally okay generally speaking when

428
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,320
you're designing uh

429
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,800
the maximum vacuum you can ever get to

430
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,399
is one atmosphere

431
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,839
right one bar simply put atmosphere as

432
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,839
you think of it right now

433
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,839
is one atmosphere if you're roughly sea

434
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,120
level it's a little less than that if

435
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,480
you're up in denver or

436
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,959
higher up also it's probably cold where

437
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,190
you are

438
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,360
[Music]

439
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,519
but but generally speaking pressure

440
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,600
there is no upper limit on pressure

441
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,000
the lower limit is absolute vacuum which

442
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,279
much like absolute zero in the

443
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,480
temperature scale

444
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,880
um exists in kind of a theoretical level

445
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,839
but

446
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,680
you can't actually get there and that's

447
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,920
a fun conversation maybe somebody'll ask

448
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,399
me about in q a

449
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,839
because crazy things happen as you get

450
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,800
close just like temperature

451
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,320
but high pressure keeps going up and up

452
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,839
and up and up and up and you can get

453
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,320
this with

454
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,720
like hydrostatic pressure in the oceans

455
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,240
and there is actually some point at

456
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,880
which

457
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,040
the pressure is sufficiently high in the

458
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,279
oceans that steel floats there's a

459
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,920
neutral buoyancy for solid steel bricks

460
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,079
which is kind of mind-blowing to think

461
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,600
about but that does exist

462
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,639
on our planet here so cool

463
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,800
when you're measuring vacuum unlike

464
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,079
higher pressure systems a lot of times

465
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,760
you use militor

466
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,839
for kind of normal vacuum applications

467
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,000
micro tor would get you into high vacuum

468
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,880
applications

469
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,320
and if you're getting into ultra high

470
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,079
vac where things get really weird

471
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,079
you talk about mean free path and what

472
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,320
that refers to is how far an individual

473
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,000
gas molecule uh

474
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,240
will move before it encounters an

475
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,120
another

476
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,680
gas molecule and bumps into it because

477
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,920
at a molecular scale at an atomic scale

478
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,639
gases things moving and bumping into

479
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,360
each other

480
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,040
randomly so if you think about mean free

481
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,399
path and atmospheric

482
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,560
conditions here on earth that tends to

483
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,600
be um

484
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
on the order of i think about 100

485
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,959
nanometers whereas in space your mean

486
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,240
free path could be

487
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
uh like in in low earth orbit your mean

488
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
free path is on the order of kilometers

489
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,279
so like hugely different but also really

490
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,880
important to think about

491
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,240
uh anyway cool let's talk about volume a

492
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,079
little bit i have uh some syringes shown

493
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,279
up there i'm sorry if that

494
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
is a phobia of yours but they are

495
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,040
commonly used in fluid applications to

496
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,240
measure volumes

497
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,000
and the nice thing about that cylinder

498
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,399
plunger uh contraption

499
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,160
um you get that in pistons as well and

500
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
i'll talk a little bit about

501
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,240
um hydraulics and pneumatics actually

502
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,040
you know what i'm going to talk about

503
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,320
here because i don't think i have

504
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,160
specific slides for it later which is a

505
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,680
bit of a glaring omission

506
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
um volume is measured in liters

507
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,199
milliliters cubic centimeters

508
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,320
um and ounces i guess

509
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,560
in english units but even most engineers

510
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,040
um in the united states will still use

511
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,880
liters milliliters cubic centimeters

512
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
instead of cubic inches

513
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,720
um ounces and so on i guess it would be

514
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,839
cubic inches

515
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,920
gross um but yeah commonly it's it's now

516
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,360
si units pretty much dominate worldwide

517
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
um syringes are nice for dosing you can

518
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,639
also pump with them

519
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,880
um and cylinders are kind of an

520
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,839
interesting thing

521
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,079
those are variable volume like uh

522
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,519
pneumatic cylinders

523
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,160
hydraulic cylinders are piston driven

524
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,040
systems

525
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,360
and you get some interesting trade-offs

526
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,040
the lower viscosity of gas means it

527
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,639
moves much more quickly into and out of

528
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,440
the piston

529
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,120
so if you have an application that that

530
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,160
needs high speed pneumatics are awesome

531
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,000
if you don't need that much strength

532
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,279
hydraulics because they're

533
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,399
incompressible

534
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,120
can move more slowly but with

535
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,199
unreasonable amounts of strength

536
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,880
in fact some of the highest pressures we

537
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,560
can achieve as humans

538
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,360
are hydraulic pressures um which is

539
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,079
crazy

540
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,920
um so it depends on how you're designing

541
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,359
which one you choose

542
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,359
almost all the applications i've needed

543
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,119
i haven't needed a whole lot of strength

544
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,959
and so i've used pneumatics pneumatics

545
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,400
are also just generally way easier to

546
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,679
deal with because you can use them from

547
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,559
an air compressor

548
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,000
rather than having to have a hydraulic

549
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,039
pump which can be a real pain

550
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,799
you also sometimes see in systems where

551
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,480
you're going to have varying volumes

552
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,039
that you have bellows systems like the

553
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,919
one i've shown here

554
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,039
to accommodate changes involved you can

555
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:29,919
also use bladders

556
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,240
and balloons for that those aren't

557
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,600
commonly used in engineering because

558
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,960
their behavior is a little bit

559
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,039
more difficult to predict um sometimes

560
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,400
you see the medical applications for

561
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,280
things like expanding stents

562
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,960
uh temperature is an inherent property

563
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880
here's a picture of berlin from earlier

564
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,760
this week

565
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,480
when the canals have frozen solid we'll

566
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,880
talk about freezing in a little while

567
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,640
but it's most commonly measured in si

568
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,160
units in celsius

569
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,840
in english units and fahrenheit but

570
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
there are absolute units of measure

571
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,200
for temperature and this is important in

572
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,559
a second when we talk about

573
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,960
thermodynamics and those are kelvin

574
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,600
which is

575
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,280
uh 273.15 degrees celsius

576
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,559
less than celsius scale

577
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,559
and rankine which is 459

578
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,520
fahrenheit colder than zero fahrenheit

579
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,880
and those are absolute

580
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,640
scales um for those things and those are

581
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,320
necessary and some of our thermodynamic

582
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,720
applications we'll talk about later

583
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,840
rankine are so rarely used uh that you

584
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,039
practically don't even know them they're

585
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,480
basically trivia

586
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,559
um temperature is typically changed by

587
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,280
heat flowing into or out of something

588
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,799
um however if you have a chemical

589
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,120
reaction that can that creates heat

590
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
within a thing so you meant you might

591
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,960
have kind of perfectly insulated

592
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
thing where you have an exothermic

593
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,200
reaction that will increase the

594
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,720
temperature within a

595
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,400
confined space even if you have perfect

596
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
insulation

597
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,960
and endothermic and exothermic refer to

598
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
the temperature flow

599
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,480
into a thing whereas heat transfer in

600
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:00,960
and out

601
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,600
has other things temperature also

602
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,880
determines the speed of sound and

603
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,480
gas you might think it's pressure haha

604
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,080
nope it's not it's how fast those little

605
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,440
molecules are zipping around

606
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,360
that allows them to bump into others

607
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,880
pressure has a minor effect but it's

608
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
mostly temperature the speed of sound

609
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,240
decreases you go higher in altitude

610
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,440
because the temperature does as well

611
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,320
okay these big three react to each other

612
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,720
in

613
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
a known mathematical way so what i've

614
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
shown here on the screen

615
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,080
is the ideal gas law um and this one

616
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,559
is useful basically for gases on a wide

617
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,440
spectrum

618
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,240
and uh the reason we don't use this um

619
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,880
for

620
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,720
liquids is because uh they're

621
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,320
incompressible and so it doesn't really

622
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,880
apply

623
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,039
this is still really useful for a lot of

624
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,080
applications that you'll see in

625
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,799
engineering

626
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,919
because you can do a little bit of

627
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,919
algebra to go a long way

628
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,160
now assuming we've got a closed system

629
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,200
meaning the amount

630
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,799
stays constant and r is the gas constant

631
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,880
so that stays constant we can do a

632
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,320
little bit of thing which means delta

633
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,960
meaning the

634
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,159
change in pv is equal to the change in t

635
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,320
so a little bit more algebra means we

636
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,440
can arrive at this

637
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,760
which is a generalized form of boyle's

638
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,880
law and charles law

639
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,640
and one other i think but i don't

640
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,919
remember the names

641
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,600
and this is really useful because it

642
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
lets us look at

643
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,120
how things are going to change let's go

644
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,720
back a little bit to where i was talking

645
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,120
about

646
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,280
my my syringe that i've capped and

647
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,960
pulled open and closed i

648
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,120
i would stand up if i weren't tethered

649
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,000
oh i've got a long enough tether

650
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,480
my syringe right here i forgot to pick

651
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,159
it up but conveniently it's on a shelf

652
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,120
i'm organized

653
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,880
okay so if i let a little bit of air

654
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,120
into my syringe here

655
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,679
i can compress it and i can pull it and

656
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,039
what happens in there is that i'm

657
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,400
changing my volume

658
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,880
but my pressure increases or decreases

659
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,480
by the same amount by the same amount

660
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,320
because my temperature is relatively the

661
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,280
same

662
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,600
um so i can push this in here and my

663
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,960
pressure is going up if i

664
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,320
half of my volume my pressure is

665
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,159
doubling right and

666
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,720
that's just this the same math here

667
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,559
assuming a constant temperature

668
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,799
now i can do some really fun things if

669
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,640
i'm using those three things together

670
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
like a refrigeration cycle which is

671
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,039
really neat so i can pressurize a thing

672
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,440
and then change the temperature around

673
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,120
and and get some interesting things out

674
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,760
that way so it's a useful thing to know

675
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,520
the mathematical relationship

676
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,039
this is basically the most complicated

677
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,919
math we'll get into today so

678
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,480
done with it i want to talk about flow

679
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,520
fields when you

680
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,760
are learning engineering a lot of times

681
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,039
you see

682
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,760
flow in a specific situation and the way

683
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,200
you can kind of think about this

684
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,280
is how how flow goes through a thing

685
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,960
and those those vectors that you see in

686
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
the middle of this uh

687
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,760
right here um that's showing that i've

688
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,600
got my highest velocity in the center of

689
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,120
this is a pipe flow

690
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,840
probably this a viscous pipe flow so

691
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,559
this is

692
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,000
water flowing through a pipe for

693
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,919
instance will have its highest velocity

694
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,960
in the middle

695
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,480
and it will have zero velocity in the

696
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,600
side and i'll talk about that in the

697
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,720
next slide

698
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,559
similarly if i have a liquid flowing

699
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,159
past a cylinder or sphere

700
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,919
i'm going to get this shape right here

701
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,000
where i have this right here

702
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,240
and i have higher velocity over here and

703
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,600
and i'll talk a little bit more about

704
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,159
this

705
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,240
in a couple of slides but i just want to

706
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,559
get you accustomed to seeing these

707
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,240
uh flow fields because they are a

708
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,480
necessary part of how you communicate

709
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,159
and have diagrams of fluids

710
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,840
the no slip condition is what we saw in

711
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,679
the previous uh

712
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,600
in the previous slide on both of those

713
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,000
surfaces so within the pipe here

714
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and along the edge of that sphere you'll

715
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,760
see that there is no movement of the

716
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,039
fluid in contact

717
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,760
and that is a fundamental of physics and

718
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,360
i'll show a video here in a second

719
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,840
fluid in contact with a surface does not

720
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,400
move

721
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,240
with respect to the surface right a

722
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,679
solid surface

723
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,880
um and so what that means is uh

724
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,679
if i have the surface of an an airfoil

725
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,520
or something like that

726
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,159
the gas right up next to it like you

727
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,880
know literally like atomically there

728
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,400
is absolutely fixed with respect to that

729
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,919
solid surface

730
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,159
and that is why you end up with drag

731
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,080
even and because you have minor amounts

732
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,679
of viscosity even in a gas

733
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,840
you end up with this drag that goes up

734
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,840
like crazy in something like a nautical

735
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,559
application

736
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,960
where you have much higher viscosity um

737
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,760
and so

738
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,360
now it's movie time so we're gonna

739
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,679
head to the next one here uh which is

740
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,039
pretty cool so this is demonstrating the

741
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,480
no slip condition

742
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
and what you're seeing here is they've

743
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,400
got a dye and a gas right up on a

744
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,679
surface you can't quite see it so you'll

745
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,799
see as it moves up

746
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,559
that it's got quite a flow moving across

747
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,919
there but the stuff that's right at the

748
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,559
surface

749
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,799
is hardly moving at all right isn't that

750
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,559
wild i think this is just such a cool

751
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,039
way to

752
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,520
illustrate this and you can see that

753
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,400
they can kind of like

754
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,360
brush it off afterwards but that the

755
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,279
flow wouldn't do it

756
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,039
so i think that's just a really good

757
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:53,919
illustration of that and that's

758
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,440
something you need to think about

759
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,880
as you're designing because that's what

760
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,720
leads us to think about

761
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,320
piping and valving and that sort of

762
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,600
stuff which we'll get into later but the

763
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,840
no slip condition is really important

764
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,640
cool

765
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,159
uh let's talk about laminar and

766
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,679
turbulent flow i'm only spending one

767
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,640
slide on this

768
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,200
this is a career worth of math actually

769
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,440
uh hundreds of years worth of math

770
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
that kind of got us to this point so

771
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,960
laminar flow

772
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,200
and i'll show turbulent flow of video of

773
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,880
turbulent flow in a second

774
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
laminar flow is smooth predictable and

775
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,159
mathematical we have

776
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,960
again like fluid like thermodynamics and

777
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,919
solid objects

778
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,760
laminar flow we have pretty well

779
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
understood from a mathematical

780
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,120
standpoint it's not particularly

781
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,480
complicated

782
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,080
and that's where viscous flow um

783
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,960
is kind of dominant and that means that

784
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,000
things pretty much

785
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,520
fluids pretty much stay in their lanes

786
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,799
you can get this in gases you can get

787
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,520
this in liquids

788
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,039
it doesn't matter this is generic for

789
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,720
fluids

790
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,760
and that's true um for

791
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,679
uh reynolds numbers being below a

792
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,200
certain amount so a reynolds number is

793
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,559
shown there at the bottom

794
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,400
of your screen and the reynolds number

795
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,559
is kind of a measure of several things

796
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,760
coming together

797
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,520
rho is density uh u in this case is the

798
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,640
velocity of the

799
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,520
of a thing l is character big l is

800
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,039
characteristic length that's kind of the

801
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,480
feature size of what you're flowing

802
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,320
through so the diameter of your pipe

803
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,799
or um the size the length of your

804
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,600
airfoil

805
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,320
that sort of thing and mu is uh your

806
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,039
kinematic

807
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,159
uh viscosity so your viscosity your

808
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,120
density

809
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,600
your flow and you're the size of your

810
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,039
object all come together

811
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,120
and when you do all this math what pops

812
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,960
out is a unitless number

813
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,120
which as a fluid dynamicist

814
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,799
non-dimension dimensionless numbers are

815
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,480
just like the greatest thing ever

816
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,679
because you don't have to worry about

817
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,000
units it doesn't have to be metric or

818
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,520
english it doesn't matter

819
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,440
all that stuff just disappears which is

820
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,840
great um and for reynolds numbers

821
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,320
you can determine whether or not a flow

822
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,720
is going to be in the laminar regime

823
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,360
a transitional regime or turbulent

824
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,720
regime so if your reynolds number if

825
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,679
you're in a pipe

826
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,840
then this varies based on geometry but

827
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,679
but generally they're pretty close to

828
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,880
these numbers

829
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,520
no matter where you are um a lower

830
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,720
reynolds number means the year in

831
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,000
laminar flow

832
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,840
as you get to these higher numbers

833
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,600
you're getting kind of this inertial

834
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,320
flow

835
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,960
and that says your density um is higher

836
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,440
than

837
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,080
your viscosity so you're getting is

838
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,000
really where that changes your speed so

839
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,840
so kind of the inertia of stuff your

840
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,120
fluid moving so it's your

841
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,039
velocity and your density together

842
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,440
dominate relative to your viscosity

843
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,720
um and that causes just chaos

844
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,600
because inertia is kind of things in

845
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,120
motion are a little chaotic

846
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,720
so we're going to watch a movie

847
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,120
about this as well to show you another

848
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,360
thing that happens in turbulent flow

849
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,480
which is really cool so here what you

850
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,039
see is

851
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,080
is a is a square square

852
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,279
a square prism in a flow regime and what

853
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,360
you're seeing here is viscous flow

854
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
in the wake of it you actually do see a

855
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,159
tiny little bit of laminar flow here

856
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,640
and then you get this like crazy

857
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,080
twirling and mixing

858
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,400
and coolness going on and what happens

859
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,760
is the chaos in there does something

860
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,200
called vortex shedding

861
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,120
where it creates lower pressure on one

862
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,880
side because the viscous flow

863
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,600
and then it switches back and forth and

864
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,760
you've seen this a zillion times out in

865
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,000
the

866
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,799
real world as flags wobbling back and

867
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,600
forth

868
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,640
in the wind um and uh

869
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,080
and in other places like when you hear

870
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,080
the

871
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,320
behind a vehicle or or whatever it is

872
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,159
that's the vortex shedding you can even

873
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,520
get it if you're driving on the highway

874
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,720
behind a big truck

875
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,320
if you're in that flow where you kind of

876
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,000
get your car wobbled back and forth

877
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,840
it's actually uh aerodynamically

878
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,600
speaking there's safety wise it's not a

879
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,799
good idea

880
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,919
um aerodynamically speaking you will

881
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,080
experience far less drag on your car

882
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,679
which is why people with tiny little

883
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,440
cars sometimes tailgate

884
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,480
these big 18 wheelers to to kind of

885
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,399
reduce their gas mileage to

886
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,559
improve their gas mileage from a safety

887
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,000
standpoint be very careful

888
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,399
about that i take no responsibility but

889
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,080
from an aerodynamic standpoint you're

890
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,799
actually getting

891
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,480
uh reduced drag from being in that low

892
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,559
pressure of the

893
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,039
the turbulent flow turbulent flow tends

894
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,799
to be lower pressure than laminar flow

895
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,120
just generally speaking in a thing which

896
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,240
leads us on to

897
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,360
drag which is another really cool thing

898
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,880
to think about

899
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,720
so there are two types of drag in

900
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
conventional fluids

901
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
you have skin drag which is the no slip

902
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,399
condition and viscosity

903
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,679
so that's kind of what i was talking

904
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,679
about earlier the fluid on the very

905
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,880
surface of your object

906
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,720
isn't moving at all with respect to the

907
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,399
object and so

908
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,279
uh the viscosity creates drag you also

909
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,320
have pressure drag

910
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,000
and you can think about this really

911
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,919
easily if i take a sheet of paper

912
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,760
and try and just move it horizontally

913
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,039
through a

914
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,000
static fluid or i have a piece of paper

915
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,440
and i have fluid blowing over it

916
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,279
from physics standpoint these are

917
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,120
exactly the same you're just changing

918
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,799
your reference whether you're on the

919
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,600
piece of paper

920
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,760
or whether you're in the the static gas

921
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,279
you will find a massive pressure

922
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,640
difference as i move quickly through

923
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,120
that between the front and the back

924
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
this makes sense my molecules are

925
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,480
getting pushed out of the way and i have

926
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,840
a place where there aren't any molecules

927
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,559
in this area

928
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,760
over here is at lower pressure and so uh

929
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,720
these are your two components to drag

930
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,559
and they they do interesting things to

931
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,960
each other so for example in basically

932
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,559
every game of sports ball

933
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,320
there is some patterning on the outside

934
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,000
of your ball i've showed one here that's

935
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
a golf ball but it's true for tennis

936
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,159
balls

937
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,320
it's true for footballs it's true for

938
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,399
baseballs with stitches

939
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,480
all of these things what they do is when

940
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
they encounter the flow field

941
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,799
they create turbulent flow so they

942
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,559
change the characteristic length in your

943
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,240
reynolds number to be shorter

944
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,080
and that means that even at the same

945
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,679
velocity sorry

946
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,080
um your flow starts to go into that

947
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,120
turbulent regime

948
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
and you get what's called turbulent a

949
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
turbulent separation point

950
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,760
and that's a really important thing so

951
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,600
you can see i've shown it i'm stealing

952
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
someone else's diagram it's shown here

953
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,559
but what that does is it allows uh the

954
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,720
the turbulent flow to get in behind

955
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,480
the thing much more quickly and that

956
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,799
reduces your pressure drag by narrowing

957
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,919
your wake

958
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,440
okay so you can see that separation

959
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,520
point here so i'm getting that nice

960
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,720
mix happening and that's improving

961
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,360
uh my aerodynamic capability so a smooth

962
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,559
golf ball will not go

963
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,360
nearly as far as a golf ball with with

964
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,640
dimples on it

965
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,399
and that's true basically any sport

966
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,600
where you're having an object move

967
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,880
through the air

968
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,520
and you see this all the time like a

969
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,240
football

970
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,000
uh like an america regardless of whether

971
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
european football or american football

972
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,679
it's the same in both cases you have

973
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,279
texturing on the outside of the ball

974
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,039
that makes them go much further

975
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,320
i want to talk a little bit about

976
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,960
conservation these are i i mean this

977
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,039
in the sense of physics uh not in the

978
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,279
sense of like conserving uh animals

979
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,039
which i also approve of

980
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,640
um but conservation of mass and

981
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,679
conservation of energy are the

982
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,799
fundamentals

983
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,880
uh mathematically that you can use to

984
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,159
basically derive

985
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,600
everything else and they are

986
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,039
they get complicated depending on how

987
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,640
you look at them but

988
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,679
but in this case uh they are important

989
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,399
um because a lot of times in engineering

990
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,240
you think of closed systems

991
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,320
so in a refrigeration cycle you're

992
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,360
taking a refrigerant

993
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,640
pushing it through the same loop again

994
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,399
and again and again and again

995
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,080
and so what that means is that you have

996
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,840
constant mass within the system as a

997
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,399
whole

998
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,000
what that also means is that if you have

999
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,919
flow through something if you have a

1000
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,519
known area

1001
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,360
like the diameter of a pipe that you

1002
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,880
have what's called flux

1003
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,720
and that's flux is a term that's used

1004
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,960
often in electrical systems as well

1005
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,120
um for like electrical fields and

1006
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,000
magnetic fields

1007
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,159
the same exact thing is true in fluids

1008
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,919
so you have an amount of fluid

1009
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,159
moving a mass of fluid moving through a

1010
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,360
specific area

1011
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,760
to get flux and that's something that is

1012
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
conserved if you have a closed system

1013
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,840
no matter what so you can do really easy

1014
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,399
calculations um

1015
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,720
of like how much liquid is moving

1016
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,840
through

1017
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,320
an orifice if you have like a big pipe

1018
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,000
going to a little pipe

1019
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,120
your material flux will be the same

1020
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,799
assuming your pressure is the same makes

1021
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,960
it even easier um but your but

1022
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,480
your material flux will be the same

1023
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,080
regardless um

1024
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,120
and the same is true with the energy

1025
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,080
which is important if you're like inter

1026
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,600
putting energy into a system

1027
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,320
and expecting it to come out somewhere

1028
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,960
okay

1029
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,519
cool uh right like i was just saying

1030
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,919
circulating systems mass is conserved

1031
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,799
throughout um you may have things that

1032
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,200
go

1033
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,679
in that come out in a different way so

1034
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,399
you can put work

1035
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,399
in and it can come out as heat this is a

1036
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,000
fundamental part of

1037
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,080
thermodynamics you're always going to

1038
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,240
have some wasted energy as heat

1039
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,799
sad but if you figure out a way around

1040
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,760
that

1041
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,799
you've broken physics and

1042
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,960
congratulations

1043
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,320
i want to talk about the bernoulli

1044
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,000
principle that's the next one

1045
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,519
and this is one that i find to be really

1046
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,279
counter-intuitive like it's

1047
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,840
i still struggle with this a lot and

1048
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,039
that is

1049
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,760
increasing fluid velocity decreases

1050
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,399
fluid

1051
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,880
pressure and this has some really neat

1052
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,679
applications

1053
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,120
that we'll talk about in a second um

1054
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,480
and so uh yeah so basically all you

1055
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,679
really you don't need to know the math

1056
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,240
part of it

1057
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,679
but just know that this happens because

1058
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,399
it's one of the fundamental things about

1059
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,279
lyft

1060
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,320
um and lyft is uh

1061
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,679
just useful um it's it's

1062
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,440
a lot of fluids kind of it's the

1063
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,840
pinnacle if you're going into

1064
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,640
aerodynamics i say that's maybe not

1065
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,679
exactly the pinnacle but

1066
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,200
and it's actually a combination of two

1067
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,039
different things

1068
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,679
it's a combination of redirecting flow

1069
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,080
and

1070
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,279
also bernoulli's principle and so uh

1071
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,720
what you're seeing in that animation

1072
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,159
there which i think is just such a good

1073
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,200
illustration of this

1074
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,559
stolen straight from wikipedia um is you

1075
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,200
see there is some fluid redirection

1076
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,679
in that the fluid is coming up at this

1077
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,519
angle and then it's going down at that

1078
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,079
angle

1079
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,359
and what that does is um for every

1080
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,040
action there is an equal but opposing

1081
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,359
reaction so by changing the flow of the

1082
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:15,918
fluid

1083
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,839
you're creating a force upward on the

1084
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,040
wing

1085
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,839
similarly with bernoulli principle

1086
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,520
you'll see that the gas moving over the

1087
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,119
top of the wing is moving much more

1088
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,399
quickly than the gas at the bottom

1089
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,239
almost twice as fast

1090
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,119
and the result of that is that it has a

1091
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,000
lower pressure

1092
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,599
so now you have a higher pressure

1093
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,520
underneath the wing and a lower pressure

1094
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,239
above it

1095
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,280
and because you have force times area

1096
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,000
you have now a force lifting your wing

1097
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,040
up

1098
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,719
so it really is a combination of these

1099
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,320
things and you can do experiments to

1100
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,800
show that

1101
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,440
neither one is fully dominant right you

1102
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,480
can have a wing

1103
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,879
with positive camber as it's shown here

1104
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,639
and it will still get lift if its angle

1105
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,320
of attack is correct that's redirection

1106
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,040
working

1107
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,640
or you can have something at zero angle

1108
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,720
of attack or even negative angle attack

1109
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,400
that still has um that still gets

1110
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,800
uh lift because you have this zero

1111
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,599
camber here

1112
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,760
and what i'm talking about in camber is

1113
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,280
this line from the very

1114
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,760
leading edge to the trailing edge

1115
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
whether that line is flat

1116
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,920
or pot or positive or positive or

1117
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,359
negative does weird

1118
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,800
weird things that chord there um

1119
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,640
cool sorry um top camera and bottom

1120
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,359
camber

1121
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,520
relative to each other sorry i'm mixing

1122
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,280
up some terms here

1123
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,079
sorry um there's some applications to

1124
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:34,880
all of this stuff

1125
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,119
kind of together the pedostatic tube is

1126
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,320
used all the time

1127
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,839
you'll see this on airplanes if you look

1128
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,200
there's a there's always there's usually

1129
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
a little thing sticking off the bottom

1130
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,040
of the wing

1131
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,960
or to the side of the cockpit it's on

1132
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,240
every airplane

1133
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,359
uh somewhere sometimes it's on the tail

1134
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,040
um and um sticking out the the tail and

1135
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,000
this is how you measure your air speed

1136
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,200
because you can take

1137
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,839
the pressure coming in your forward

1138
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:00,400
pressure

1139
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,640
and you can uh take the side pressure

1140
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,599
the vent pressure

1141
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,160
the static pressure um and that and you

1142
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,079
can subtract those two numbers

1143
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,480
um and mathematically you can solve for

1144
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,200
velocity

1145
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,720
which is super cool so it's taking all

1146
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,240
of these principles um

1147
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,599
you can do some research on this if

1148
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,680
you're you're still struggling with this

1149
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
um it takes all of these kind of

1150
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,119
principles that we just talked about

1151
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,560
and has a practical application i just

1152
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,680
wanted to show this one because i think

1153
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,359
it's a really elegant thing

1154
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,560
because you can just solve it through

1155
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,400
this is one of those moments where in

1156
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,680
fluid dynamics class i

1157
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,079
i at the end of the lecture you know the

1158
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,839
professor underlines a thing and does

1159
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,200
the formula you're like oh that's

1160
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,599
really elegant that's really cool can't

1161
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,599
imagine somebody discovered that

1162
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,920
but they did all right that's all of

1163
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,280
fluids um

1164
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,640
and that's every bit of fluid dynamics

1165
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,000
you ever wanted to know let's move into

1166
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,359
thermodynamics so we still have some

1167
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:49,920
time

1168
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,280
at the end to talk about design

1169
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,800
thermodynamics which is the movement of

1170
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,680
heat uh i'm gonna break it down today

1171
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,960
into a couple of things i'm not gonna

1172
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,920
get the combustion

1173
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,839
i'm sorry combustion is really cool but

1174
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,200
it's really complicated

1175
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,960
um and it's also really useful in things

1176
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,320
like jet engines and

1177
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,480
internal combustion engines but the math

1178
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,359
is not trivial

1179
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,599
so we're going to skip it today sorry

1180
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,640
we're going to talk about the different

1181
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,839
types of heat transfer

1182
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,599
all three of those we're going to talk

1183
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,440
about heat that does work

1184
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,040
very briefly and i know i sound like i'm

1185
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,480
a cop out on this but again that's one

1186
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,400
that's a lot of math

1187
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,920
so i'm not talking about it too much i'm

1188
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,800
going to talk about state changes

1189
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,760
because those are really useful and

1190
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,280
those are practically applicable for you

1191
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,640
guys at home

1192
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,359
i'll define and go over psychometrics um

1193
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:33,920
a little bit

1194
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,760
and some refrigeration which kind of is

1195
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,119
an adjacent field

1196
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,240
to psychometrics in a lot of ways

1197
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,800
cool radiation is one of the three

1198
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,200
fundamental types of heat transfer

1199
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,880
technically it is an electromagnetic

1200
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,680
emission it's usually in the ir spectrum

1201
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,040
but at higher temperatures

1202
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,760
it becomes it lapses into the visible

1203
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,839
spectrum and this is true

1204
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,240
no matter what material it is at about

1205
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,640
450 or 500

1206
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,320
see things become red hot about

1207
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,160
thousands see they become white hot um

1208
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,480
and

1209
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,880
past that you have a sun right which is

1210
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,400
basically this

1211
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,200
insanely hot thing that is kicking off a

1212
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,119
ton of electromagnetic emission

1213
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,240
um most of which is ir heat

1214
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,440
as you think of it um and uh

1215
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,880
also a fair bit of visible which is

1216
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,160
convenient because that's what our

1217
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,599
eyeballs see

1218
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,119
um all matter emits

1219
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,040
every every uh every every bit of matter

1220
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
that's above absolute zero which again

1221
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,280
doesn't really exist in nature anywhere

1222
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,480
solution doesn't

1223
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,640
quite exist but it does but it doesn't

1224
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,599
but it does

1225
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,400
um all matter emits it and it flows from

1226
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,680
higher temperature to lower temperature

1227
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,040
which is why when you're out on a sunny

1228
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,240
day the sun which

1229
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,079
the surface of which is i don't know 20

1230
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,280
000 kelvin

1231
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,440
um warms your skin which is definitely

1232
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,880
not 20 000 kelvin

1233
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,359
no matter how hot you are um and it does

1234
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,960
so mathematically

1235
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,000
um at the difference in between the

1236
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,800
temperatures

1237
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,680
to the fourth um and so what's important

1238
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,400
there is that your

1239
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,079
time's a really really really tiny

1240
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,839
number importantly

1241
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:06,880
but you don't have to worry about that

1242
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,800
because it's constant it's important

1243
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,160
that you do those calculations with

1244
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,040
absolute units

1245
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,839
you cannot use celsius you must use

1246
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,720
kelvin um

1247
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,760
and that determines

1248
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,680
how all of these things interact but

1249
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,880
generally speaking from a

1250
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,119
from an applied standpoint uh what you

1251
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,240
need to know

1252
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,200
um is that it is an electromagnetic

1253
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,040
emission um and it goes from higher to

1254
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,400
lower temperatures

1255
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,520
and uh if it's visibly hot then it's

1256
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,160
really

1257
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,040
too hot to touch conduction is what

1258
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,920
happens within

1259
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,480
typically within solids and i and it's

1260
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:40,960
not

1261
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,280
strictly true and i'll talk about that

1262
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,160
in the next slide

1263
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,800
um but it's between or within solid

1264
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,839
objects is where you

1265
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,800
really think about conduction um and it

1266
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,280
is

1267
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,240
it is mathematically known what's called

1268
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,440
the heat equation which is a big

1269
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,720
differential equation that's scary

1270
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,800
looking and we won't get into

1271
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,520
but that is kind of the foundation of

1272
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:01,920
heat

1273
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,920
transfer and and

1274
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,200
what you should know about conduction is

1275
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,560
that it is in in a steady state solution

1276
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,640
linear with the temperature difference

1277
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,400
between two things

1278
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,119
um and that's just a convenient thing to

1279
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,960
know so as you start to

1280
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,040
start to heat things up on the

1281
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,240
temperature difference

1282
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,359
uh on like a bar you'll get a linear

1283
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,079
distribution

1284
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,920
in steady state once once it's fully

1285
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,520
heated so you have you know cold water

1286
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,040
over here and hot water over here

1287
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,119
your temperature difference in between

1288
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,680
will be linear

1289
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,359
at steady state very importantly

1290
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,839
cool convection is the fun one this is

1291
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,599
what my master's research was in

1292
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,960
um i'll talk about that at the end of

1293
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,880
the slide but it's super cool so

1294
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,040
there are two types of convection um and

1295
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,160
both of them are

1296
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,680
conduction of heat to

1297
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,760
a fluid and it gets crazy

1298
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,640
really fast because now you have heat

1299
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,880
going into something that is also

1300
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,079
mobile on its own um

1301
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,200
yeah so um it gets crazy there are two

1302
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,920
types

1303
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,240
um one is called natural convection

1304
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,960
which you

1305
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,319
think of commonly as hot air rising

1306
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,319
um and actually that's not quite the

1307
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,240
whole story though

1308
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,640
i'm showing it here in the diagram and

1309
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,839
what happens is

1310
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,200
the object heats something

1311
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,640
which increases which which

1312
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,480
lowers its density by increasing or

1313
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,040
sorry by decreasing its pressure

1314
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,560
and what happens is gravity then

1315
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,040
displaces it because there's heavier air

1316
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,040
somewhere else that forces it up and

1317
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,240
this you see

1318
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,280
in all fluids liquids gases

1319
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,640
so on because there is some density

1320
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,720
change even in incompressible fluids

1321
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,680
and that causes that uh that flow and

1322
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,960
the replenishment flow

1323
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,240
the same thing happens in reverse if you

1324
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,760
have a cold object and you've probably

1325
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,560
seen this

1326
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,319
if you ever watch a space shuttle launch

1327
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,760
or a rocket launch

1328
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,839
when the engines or at cryogenic

1329
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,119
temperatures you see

1330
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,480
steam condensing and moving down

1331
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,800
um because it's because it's colder and

1332
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,760
more dense and so it drops

1333
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,520
right that's natural convection um and

1334
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,040
my master's research was about this so i

1335
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,200
did my master's research at nasa langley

1336
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,000
um about trying to model what happens in

1337
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,839
microgravity so if you're in orbit

1338
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,760
and you're inside of a pressurized thing

1339
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,440
like the international space station

1340
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,599
there is no real up where does your hot

1341
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,680
air go it doesn't it just sticks around

1342
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,200
and does all sorts of goofy things

1343
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,640
which is why things like cameras

1344
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,720
overheat when they're in orbit

1345
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
uh fun fact anyway i think you probably

1346
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,000
have never really thought about but is

1347
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,480
actually super cool

1348
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,720
force convection is natural convections

1349
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,319
sibling

1350
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,800
and it's what happens if you are have

1351
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,560
your hot piece of pizza and you

1352
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,040
blow over the top you are forcing air

1353
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
over the top cooler air than the pizza

1354
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,800
and you get much much much greater

1355
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,640
efficiency at the heat transfer

1356
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,440
to that liquid or sorry to that fluid

1357
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,880
in that thing uh the math on this gets

1358
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,560
just nutty really fast but like i said

1359
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,520
we fluid dynamicists uh absolutely love

1360
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,880
our dimensionless numbers

1361
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,520
and so uh there are a whole bunch of

1362
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,240
different

1363
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,160
ones rayleigh number prandtl number and

1364
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,800
nusselt number all of these predict

1365
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,839
when you move from force to natural

1366
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,040
convection and all sorts of other crazy

1367
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,599
stuff

1368
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,000
to get that out um turns out this is a

1369
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,599
pretty complicated system

1370
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,359
um and uh uh yeah it gets it gets crazy

1371
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,960
really fast but it's really interesting

1372
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,720
and has a lot of practical hey

1373
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,920
there's the slide for that um so one of

1374
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,480
the things

1375
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,440
when you're designing specifically to

1376
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,000
increase

1377
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,160
convective heat transfer is you want to

1378
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,520
increase your surface area right so

1379
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
you're going the opposite direction

1380
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,480
of nature in the surface area to volume

1381
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,040
ratio

1382
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,400
but you do actually see this in nature

1383
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,240
some ears are a great example of this

1384
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,400
that's your body's uh that's your body's

1385
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,440
cooling fins

1386
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
um which you see like elephants have

1387
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,880
really giant ears and that's what lets

1388
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,280
them

1389
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,079
deal with very hot temperatures where

1390
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:10,720
they are

1391
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,280
typically found we humans do a really

1392
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,480
good job of this

1393
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,599
[Music]

1394
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,359
and that's because we can divert a lot

1395
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,640
of blood flow into

1396
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,240
places that have very high surface area

1397
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,680
notably our ears and our nose which

1398
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,200
means if it's cold outside

1399
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,640
cover your ears cover your nose neat

1400
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,440
um you can do this if you have pipes and

1401
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,720
you need to get a lot of convection out

1402
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,480
of it by creating multiple loops

1403
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,280
of a thing in particular if even if you

1404
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,200
have very successful convection off of

1405
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,000
your pipes

1406
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,280
if you have pipes that are made of an

1407
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,560
insulating material which i'll talk

1408
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,359
about in

1409
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,560
a second one talk about pipes um you may

1410
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,280
uh you may not get the advantages from

1411
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,000
that

1412
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,040
um typically always forced convection is

1413
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,319
going to be more effective

1414
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,760
than natural convection so you have a

1415
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,280
heat sink shown here that's relying on

1416
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,240
natural convection

1417
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,920
toss a fan on that sucker all of a

1418
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,599
sudden your convection gets

1419
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,200
way better awesome um ideally you want

1420
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,240
to set up to

1421
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,560
go alongside your natural convective

1422
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,280
flow

1423
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,040
with your forced convection so if you

1424
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,800
have vertical fins

1425
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,920
um pipe your air up right

1426
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,160
so you get more in as you do don't

1427
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,520
counteract your flow

1428
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,960
that's a pain you don't want to do that

1429
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,480
so anticipate your flow direction and

1430
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,200
work alongside it

1431
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,720
heat exchangers uh here's where you have

1432
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,920
two fluids

1433
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,760
and something conductive in between them

1434
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,040
but they are not mixing

1435
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,920
with each other right the most efficient

1436
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,200
way to do this so there's a bunch of

1437
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,400
different types of heat exchangers

1438
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,280
sometimes you have

1439
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,520
a bunch of tubes going through a shell

1440
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,880
which is kind of shown there

1441
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,720
you can get cross and counter flow you

1442
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,400
see this most commonly in radiators for

1443
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,359
heating

1444
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,520
uh or in your car radiator where you're

1445
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,280
trying to get heat out into the

1446
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:49,920
environment

1447
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,520
as that's caused from the combustion you

1448
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,880
want to get that out into the

1449
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,079
environment really quickly

1450
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,359
the most efficient way to do this is

1451
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,200
with counter current flow or some

1452
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,800
combination of counter current

1453
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,560
and cross flow um and uh

1454
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,160
and so that's that lets you get um

1455
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,280
and wait by counter current i mean uh

1456
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,160
your uh let's see

1457
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,880
your flows your heat goes in opposite

1458
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,400
places

1459
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,880
so your coldest and your hottest are

1460
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,920
matched up on both sides

1461
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,119
heat that does work this is where you

1462
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,000
take that enthalpy

1463
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,319
your product to pressure and volume um

1464
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,400
to create work this is a big turbine

1465
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,520
you can tell because there's a

1466
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,160
normal-sized human on one side um

1467
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,240
and that turbine is ginormous i don't

1468
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,760
know that could be from a jet turbine

1469
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,119
but i think it's more likely probably

1470
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,319
from power generation

1471
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,240
looking at it it's my guess but i don't

1472
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,079
know um

1473
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,480
you can use combustion which converts

1474
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,839
chemical potential energy into

1475
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,599
thermodynamic energy by virtue of

1476
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,520
expanding a gas

1477
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,839
and you see this in auto and diesel

1478
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,920
cycles that's the mathematical terms

1479
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,160
for what's going on inside your engine

1480
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,680
whether it's a diesel engine or

1481
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,680
a kind of a conventional gasoline

1482
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,040
internal combustion engine those are the

1483
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,480
mathematical things

1484
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,319
that underlie those by using chemical

1485
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,680
combustion to do that i know i said i

1486
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,359
wasn't going to talk about

1487
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,040
chemical or combustion but there i did

1488
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,480
it um

1489
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,040
turbines uh typically follow the rankine

1490
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,720
cycle that's how kind of how efficient

1491
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,680
they can be

1492
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,480
um and they can be extremely efficient

1493
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,240
um like upwards of 98

1494
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,559
efficiency but you typically see them

1495
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,079
most often in an industrial scale it

1496
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,520
would be hard to make a very efficient

1497
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,480
turbine

1498
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,200
um at kind of a smaller scale a lot of

1499
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,400
times because you're using things like

1500
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,800
superheated steam and that stuff

1501
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,400
will corrode basically anything

1502
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,880
state changes are really useful uh for

1503
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,720
you at home

1504
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,720
um and you can use them because they

1505
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,079
maintain temperatures

1506
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,119
for with a lot of heat input and uh the

1507
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,559
reason that i've got that chart on there

1508
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:55,599
that you're seeing on the right hand

1509
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,200
side

1510
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,960
is because you go through a state change

1511
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,800
your temperature stays static

1512
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,280
and this is really really useful um like

1513
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,200
if you need to cool a lot of stuff

1514
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,440
ice water is really convenient the water

1515
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,280
gets you in adjacent to your surface

1516
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,440
and the ice takes a lot of energy to

1517
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,280
melt and turn into liquid water

1518
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,040
even though it stays at that exact same

1519
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,400
temperature zero c

1520
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,920
if you're at standard temperature and

1521
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,520
pressure it is a little bit pressure

1522
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,160
dependent

1523
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,760
particularly as you're going between

1524
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,680
liquid and gas um

1525
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,319
so like i can put water into my syringe

1526
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,359
and i can boil it

1527
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:28,880
by pulling a hole by lowering the

1528
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,400
pressure a whole lot

1529
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,559
even though i'm still at you know i

1530
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,720
don't know in this room it's probably

1531
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,839
17 degrees celsius

1532
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,599
sweater does not work for 17 degrees

1533
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,119
fahrenheit

1534
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,720
so that is pressure dependent but if

1535
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,160
you're assuming relatively constant

1536
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,440
atmospheric pressure which you could

1537
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,720
typically do

1538
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,680
in something that is at ambient pressure

1539
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,640
then you can

1540
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,400
very accurately know that your state

1541
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,240
change is happening at a specific point

1542
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,480
which is really easy if you want to have

1543
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,319
temperature maintained at a specific

1544
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:58,800
point

1545
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,319
and you can change where your state

1546
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,400
changes happen by mixing things

1547
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,359
so if i want my state change from from

1548
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,040
my melting state change or my melting

1549
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,319
freezing state change

1550
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,520
to be below zero degrees celsius

1551
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,760
i can get that by diluting it with say

1552
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,720
ethanol so

1553
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,760
conventional alcohol or with sugar um

1554
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,200
and you can play around with these

1555
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,359
things for example uh if you want to

1556
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,559
make ice cream

1557
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,559
uh you have to get if your sugar content

1558
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,640
goes up you may have to change your

1559
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,079
your other other things your water

1560
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,359
content to make sure you still freeze

1561
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,079
properly

1562
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:33,200
anyway very interesting things ice cream

1563
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,440
everybody loves ice cream uh if you need

1564
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,400
to get things cold

1565
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,000
refrigeration is a really good way to do

1566
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,880
it for the practical applications

1567
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,359
you can usually think of a refrigeration

1568
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,559
unit as a heat pump

1569
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,119
it takes heat from one place and expels

1570
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,480
it to another

1571
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,839
and this is true of your refrigerator

1572
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:50,880
it's true of your air conditioning

1573
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,480
systems it's true of

1574
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,040
um of all manner of refrigeration

1575
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,720
systems

1576
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,559
and that's true not just so there's two

1577
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,319
different ways conventionally that it's

1578
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,280
done

1579
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,720
almost everything you see out there in

1580
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,240
the real world which is a very efficient

1581
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,119
way to do it

1582
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,960
uses the carnot cycle where you compress

1583
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,760
a thing take the heat out of it

1584
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,920
expand it and it cools off again

1585
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,839
and you do some forced convection over

1586
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,440
your heat exchangers

1587
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,440
to get that out into a thing so your

1588
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,880
refrigerator at home

1589
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,760
almost certainly is this thing there's

1590
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,960
another way to do it

1591
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,319
using what's called a thermoelectric

1592
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,599
effect which i think is the seebeck

1593
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:26,000
effect

1594
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,520
if i remember correctly and you get

1595
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,599
these little tiny uh little chips and

1596
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:30,960
you pipe a bunch of voltage into them

1597
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,240
and one side gets cold the other side

1598
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,880
gets hot

1599
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,079
you reverse the voltage and the same

1600
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,280
thing goes the other direction you can

1601
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,720
also generate voltage from them

1602
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,680
they're really inefficient so you might

1603
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,559
pipe

1604
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,800
uh you know 100 watts into one of these

1605
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,400
little things and you're only cooling

1606
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,200
like

1607
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,400
15 watts um so

1608
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,359
i would not use one to like do anything

1609
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,800
more than

1610
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,200
like cool maybe a processing unit

1611
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,319
something like that you could do pretty

1612
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,599
efficiently though

1613
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,079
but i wouldn't try to like do a state

1614
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:01,119
change

1615
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,880
we tried to freeze ice for one of our

1616
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,359
cocktail robots and we put 600 watts

1617
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,880
into one of these coolers and we froze a

1618
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,000
piece of ice about the size

1619
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,440
of my pinky and it took us about 45

1620
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,000
seconds

1621
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,520
which is quick for freezing but like

1622
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,160
that is a lot of juice going in there

1623
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,839
for not much effect um

1624
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,400
yeah but your high efficiency stuff is

1625
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,079
much more bulky and it creates noise

1626
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:24,880
whereas

1627
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,400
uh your thermoelectric stuff is

1628
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,599
literally silent there's no moving parts

1629
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,400
cool moving right along oh yeah peltier

1630
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:32,960
yep

1631
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,079
correct um

1632
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,760
psychrometrics is the study of gas and

1633
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,680
vapor mixtures so

1634
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,480
um you always have some and this is

1635
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,520
mostly used

1636
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,040
in climate control so for your air

1637
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,319
conditioning systems and i'm just

1638
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,680
touching briefly on this

1639
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,359
because again this is a like a phd level

1640
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,400
topic um and so

1641
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,400
it's it's what it's it's what gives that

1642
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,440
your temperature

1643
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,000
feel um you as a human are coated in

1644
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,880
moisture

1645
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,359
your skin creates moisture and what that

1646
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,000
does interesting

1647
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,640
things because it tends to evaporate uh

1648
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,400
in environments that are less than 100

1649
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,520
percent

1650
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,240
moisture or or rather where you're above

1651
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,760
the dew point

1652
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,200
um so things you know where your skin is

1653
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,720
anyway um so that's how you sense

1654
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,680
uh it's how you sense temperature and so

1655
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,200
there are several factors in your

1656
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,319
psychrometrics

1657
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,079
uh dew point wet bulb temperature which

1658
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,520
is what happens if you put basically a

1659
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,640
wet sock around the bottom of a

1660
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,240
thermometer and blow air over it

1661
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,240
does your temperature go down it does

1662
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,440
okay your wet bulb temperature is lower

1663
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,559
and humidity which again this is why

1664
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,160
berlin when it's you know 80 humidity

1665
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,440
and uh two degrees celsius and windy

1666
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,000
feels way colder than chicago does when

1667
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,480
it's

1668
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,760
minus 20 degrees and 20 humidity i have

1669
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,599
lived in both places and i assure you

1670
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,359
brilliant feels colder despite the fact

1671
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,240
that chicago is

1672
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,760
way colder um yeah

1673
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,240
cool that's thermodynamics and very

1674
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:04,880
quick

1675
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,240
now we're going to talk about resources

1676
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,520
for design and we're going to try and do

1677
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,640
it

1678
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,680
in uh seven minutes

1679
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,760
cbc effect is oh you're right seaback

1680
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,040
effect is thermocouples

1681
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,160
ah so close all right resourceful design

1682
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,280
me with a goofy face

1683
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,280
as always uh we already talked about

1684
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,960
pressure vessels basically spheres and

1685
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,240
cylinders is your dream

1686
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,400
uh so we'll just jump into piping pumps

1687
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,280
and valves

1688
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,640
piping when you're designing one of

1689
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,760
you're probably the first thing you

1690
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,839
choose when you do piping is diameter

1691
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,599
um if you are handling uh

1692
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,200
well all fluids have viscosity but if

1693
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,720
you're handling a liquid

1694
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,440
your diameter has a big big big deal on

1695
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,400
how much

1696
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,920
head loss you get and that's the

1697
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,440
pressure required to pipe something

1698
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,400
through a thing

1699
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,480
and you can get an intuitive sense for

1700
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,319
this as you take a

1701
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,920
soda straw and try and suck water

1702
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,960
through it um if you have a very very

1703
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,480
long soda straw like remember those like

1704
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,599
crazy cool

1705
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,480
neat shaped straws that you maybe had as

1706
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,440
a kid i did

1707
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,359
um i mean you try and pull a milkshake

1708
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,200
through one of those it ain't happening

1709
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,760
um you're gonna be there your brains are

1710
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,280
gonna end up inside the straw rather

1711
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,640
than the milkshake

1712
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,000
um but uh but yeah so so

1713
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,839
a higher a larger diameter makes it much

1714
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,200
easier

1715
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,839
to go through there sorry i'm speaking

1716
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,119
fast

1717
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,240
you also want to think about your

1718
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,000
material in your um in your piping

1719
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,880
weight is important thermal conductivity

1720
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,760
is important if you're going to be

1721
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,680
making your own heat exchanger

1722
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,079
um if you need things to stay insulated

1723
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,119
plastic is great

1724
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,760
uh if you need things to stay to cool

1725
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,040
off quickly like you're running

1726
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,319
kind of making your own heat exchanger

1727
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,319
system then your metal is much much much

1728
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:47,440
better in that case i would go with

1729
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,319
copper because

1730
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,680
it's really easy to form once it's

1731
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,839
already a tube um and

1732
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,920
it is highly thermally conductive so you

1733
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,760
can kind of just assume that it's going

1734
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,040
to do a good job there you see this a

1735
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,839
lot of times

1736
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,359
in your conventional heat exchangers

1737
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,690
they are often made of copper

1738
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:02,960
[Music]

1739
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,880
you do want to take a take a look at

1740
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,319
galvanic corrosion which i talked about

1741
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:07,839
a bunch in the materials

1742
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:11,680
uh presentation and in uh week two

1743
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,200
and that's when you have two dissimilar

1744
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,720
metals in dry

1745
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,280
electrical contact with each other in a

1746
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,319
in a

1747
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,880
solution and a water containing solution

1748
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,920
and that will cause

1749
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,200
basically you create a tiny little

1750
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,119
battery and that um

1751
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,880
electroplates part of it or i guess it

1752
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,480
goes into solution and corrodes

1753
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,480
heavily the other part of it which is

1754
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,040
bad news bears you don't want that

1755
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,079
you're also going to choose whether you

1756
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,640
want rigid or flexible um

1757
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,280
piping and tubing are both kind of

1758
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,640
semantically i kind of use them

1759
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,000
interchangeably but

1760
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,520
realistically maybe there's a difference

1761
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,680
i don't know um

1762
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,920
but rigid and flexible are important if

1763
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,720
you have something

1764
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,440
uh that's going to need to be in a

1765
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,559
static place

1766
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,680
then uh i would definitely uh

1767
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,799
have a rigid pipe uh connection types i

1768
00:55:58,799 --> 00:55:59,920
just want to go over some of my

1769
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,559
favorites

1770
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,960
uh what you're seeing here is a push to

1771
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,400
connect and these are really nice

1772
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,880
particularly for pneumatic systems they

1773
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,240
hold pretty good pressure

1774
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,920
not perfect but with pneumatic systems

1775
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,760
you're going to be able to get more air

1776
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,280
with water liquid systems

1777
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,920
hydraulic systems uh your high pressures

1778
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,359
are going to struggle a little bit here

1779
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:20,400
they're nice because they're easy to

1780
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,040
replace

1781
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,920
flexible tubing in and out of on the

1782
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,640
other hand

1783
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,839
here and over here you have

1784
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,839
a pipe thread and pipe threads are

1785
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,280
interesting because they're tapered and

1786
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,640
what that means is as they

1787
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,720
lock into themselves they they seal

1788
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,839
because the threads get bigger bigger

1789
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,680
bigger as you thread them in

1790
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,200
and that pushes out deforming the

1791
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,720
material slightly

1792
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,480
you do typically want to use with pipe

1793
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,880
thread some thread tape and that's not

1794
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,880
an adhesive tape it's a thin layer of

1795
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,520
teflon

1796
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,680
that you coat around three four five

1797
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,559
revolutions

1798
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,280
and then when you thread it in um it

1799
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,960
deforms in and gets a very very good

1800
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,640
seal and pipe systems can have can

1801
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,359
handle

1802
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,440
really really high silly high pressures

1803
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,640
in fun ways

1804
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,960
um this thing right here that you're

1805
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,559
looking at is what's called a barb use

1806
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:05,280
these with

1807
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,480
with tubes and with hose flexible things

1808
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,319
fit over that and then you get a seal as

1809
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,240
they form back into it i use those

1810
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,440
frequently as well they're really

1811
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,480
convenient

1812
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,079
i do want to go over i'm going to brand

1813
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,079
name drop here swagelok you can get

1814
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,079
off-brand as well of the same thing

1815
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,440
and what this does is it has a taper

1816
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,400
that fits into a socket and then when

1817
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,359
the tube

1818
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,440
is cranked down against it it deforms a

1819
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,960
ferrule into the tube

1820
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,520
and into the taper simultaneously and

1821
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,440
these systems can handle

1822
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,760
gosh a ton of pressure hundreds of bar

1823
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,680
when they're properly assembled and

1824
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,559
they're really nice because they're

1825
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,480
pretty easy to take apart as well

1826
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,599
they don't ever hold quite as much

1827
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:46,880
pressure after the first time but you

1828
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,920
can still get very high pressures

1829
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,280
and have something that comes apart

1830
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,799
easily and goes back together you need

1831
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,640
to have pretty rigid tubing to use them

1832
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,079
you can't use super floppy stuff because

1833
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,200
it doesn't seal

1834
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,559
um but uh but but with like stainless

1835
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:01,839
steel tubing

1836
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:06,160
and swagelok what a beautiful thing

1837
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,079
i do want to talk about pumps ooh gotta

1838
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,079
go real fast i'm gonna go on a q a time

1839
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,599
i'm sorry guys

1840
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,839
um we'll talk about pump curves types of

1841
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,680
pumps i'm br breaking them into low

1842
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,119
viscosity and high viscosity pumps which

1843
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,960
is an utterly arbitrary thing

1844
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,880
also you can use any of them for low or

1845
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,319
high viscosity thing but

1846
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,880
whatever here i've got a syringe pump

1847
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,680
shown on the screen

1848
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,920
basically all that is is a motor that

1849
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,119
pushes a syringe

1850
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,799
it's great for closed systems where you

1851
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,839
need to have very precise dosing

1852
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,960
or a very known amount of material going

1853
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,920
there's also bladders bellows solenoid

1854
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,680
diaphragms where a solenoid will push a

1855
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,720
thing

1856
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,200
which my 1970 chevelle back in texas has

1857
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:45,920
where it

1858
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,880
pulls a vacuum to create everything and

1859
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,440
there's a

1860
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,359
just a huge variety of really cool

1861
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,200
specialty vacuum pumps that i could dork

1862
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,480
out about forever

1863
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,880
we're not going to um i also want to

1864
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,319
talk about head pressure because it's a

1865
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,599
pressure measurement but it actually

1866
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,440
talks more about the piping resistance

1867
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,319
you get

1868
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:05,040
in a loss self-priming pump simply

1869
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,319
refers to the fact that

1870
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,240
if you have uh air in a thing and you're

1871
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,680
trying to pump a liquid that it will

1872
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,680
pull enough air out to move liquid up a

1873
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,640
certain amount

1874
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,920
into the pump so it can start pumping

1875
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,440
with high efficiency if it has to pump

1876
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,520
an incompressible thing

1877
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,599
pumps are always pulsatile or constant

1878
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,359
and what that means is

1879
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,040
sometimes i'm delivering a pulse so

1880
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,799
pulse pulse pulse pulse pulse of

1881
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,760
pressure

1882
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,280
and sometimes i'm delivering a constant

1883
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,680
flow if i need to get a constant flow

1884
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,720
out of a pulsatile delivery system like

1885
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,879
a

1886
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,119
a peristaltic pump what i can do is i

1887
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,119
can have a pressure chamber where i have

1888
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,880
some gas and mostly liquid

1889
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,280
as it pumps in the gas will compress but

1890
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,319
then it will

1891
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:45,680
provide a constant pressure so you'll

1892
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,000
pressurize that gas gas in the headspace

1893
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,520
and you'll get a nice smooth delivery

1894
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,880
that's how a beer keg works

1895
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,400
it's really really a convenient way to

1896
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,480
get constant rate delivery

1897
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,480
from something cool uh pump curves

1898
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,960
are um what you see when you look up a

1899
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,480
specific pump it'll give you they'll

1900
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,599
give you a pump curve and this is

1901
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:06,559
telling you

1902
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,599
um a pressure amount in terms

1903
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,640
of head pressure in length weirdly

1904
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,799
um versus the flow rate coming out of

1905
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:15,680
the pump

1906
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,640
so you convert you can convert your head

1907
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,119
length

1908
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,000
to pressure um and you do that by

1909
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,760
googling it

1910
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,480
it's dumb but it works um so this is

1911
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,799
kind of how you read one um so you would

1912
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,760
design

1913
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,799
and let's say i need um my i've got my i

1914
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:33,119
need

1915
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:37,280
uh 1.4 bar um i need 15 meters

1916
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,200
i'm going to look over here on my on my

1917
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,799
15 i'm going to say i need a flow rate

1918
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:42,319
of at least 10.

1919
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:44,640
okay that's like here-ish okay so i can

1920
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,520
specify

1921
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,640
the htm 15. and this is a manufacturer

1922
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,000
that has a variety of models

1923
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,359
so i'll say okay i'm below the curve i'm

1924
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,839
good to go

1925
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,839
these pumps i typically use for low

1926
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:57,760
viscosity they don't have to be

1927
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,319
um fans impellers and centrifugal are

1928
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:01,359
things where

1929
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,920
you spin stuff around and stuff moves a

1930
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,480
fan

1931
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,640
you kind of understand intuitively it's

1932
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,640
basically little airfoils moving around

1933
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,000
an impeller is the same thing on a

1934
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,119
different axis

1935
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,920
um so you can see it down there um and

1936
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,359
then a centrifugal pump

1937
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,040
flings stuff to the outsides so you have

1938
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,799
an inlet in the center so with an

1939
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,400
impeller pump you have an inlet on one

1940
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,400
side and it pushes out the other side

1941
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,640
with a centrifugal pump you have an

1942
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,240
inlet in the center that comes in right

1943
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:28,799
here

1944
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:30,319
and then it basically flings things to

1945
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:31,760
the outside increasing the pressure on

1946
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,400
the outside

1947
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,160
and you have a discharge in a direction

1948
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,520
part of the reason that i'm on a

1949
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,640
different computer today is so that i

1950
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,000
can get all these animations going at

1951
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,400
once i love pumps they're super cool

1952
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,680
um you're looking at a whole bunch of

1953
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,440
different types uh this one right here

1954
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,640
is called a scroll pump

1955
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,040
because it's scrolling around in a

1956
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,079
spiral

1957
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,520
it's super neat uh you see these

1958
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,280
sometimes in vacuum pumps but they work

1959
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,720
for anything

1960
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,200
um including high viscosity stuff um

1961
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,039
this is a vein pump

1962
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:00,559
here um you've got a spring in the

1963
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:01,839
middle there so as this thing rotates

1964
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:02,559
around

1965
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,079
it takes a high volume thing and pushes

1966
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,720
it into being a low volume thing

1967
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,119
here is an external gear pump where it's

1968
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,200
piping around the external

1969
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,839
sides here is an internal gear pump and

1970
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:15,280
this one's really cool so what it's

1971
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,799
doing is it's taking

1972
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,280
um it's got an inlet basically over on

1973
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,119
heat on here coming down from the top

1974
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:22,880
and an outlet over here and it's just

1975
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,319
moving from one side to the other and

1976
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:25,920
these are used in fuel pumps commonly in

1977
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,680
automotive applications

1978
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,000
uh this one down here is a peristaltic

1979
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,440
pump it's a piece of tubing that's being

1980
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,640
pushed by a roller

1981
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,559
and this is about as pulsatile a pump as

1982
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,240
you can get um

1983
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,319
and also the tubing wears out however

1984
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:39,839
they're real cheap to manufacture so you

1985
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,920
can buy these as hobbyists

1986
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,119
and they're nice if you need to do

1987
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,520
precise dosing like if you're doing

1988
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,839
home like plant growing or cocktail

1989
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:48,559
robots

1990
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:49,680
or those sorts of things these are a

1991
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,160
real cheap nice alternative and you can

1992
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,599
count the revolutions going in and have

1993
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,280
a very good idea of what's going on the

1994
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,400
other side

1995
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,920
this is a diaphragm pump you find these

1996
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,520
a lot of times also kind of at the

1997
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,720
hobbyist scale they're

1998
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,920
really nice for pumping pretty high

1999
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,079
like they're cheap to manufacture so you

2000
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,520
can you can get them

2001
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,000
for air pumps a lot of times for like

2002
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,280
aquariums and that sort of stuff but

2003
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,480
i've used them for a whole bunch of

2004
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,680
different applications all over the

2005
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,880
place

2006
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,400
they're a nice one valves hey cool

2007
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,920
um there are a whole bunch of different

2008
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,200
functions of valve i'm going to talk

2009
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,319
about different valve

2010
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:25,119
functions um this one that you see here

2011
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:26,720
is what's called a tesla valve

2012
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,880
um he didn't call it that but it is was

2013
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,559
invented by nikolai tesla

2014
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,720
and this is a passive check valve it's

2015
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,920
super cool because

2016
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,680
fluid can flow through it one direction

2017
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,760
really easily and it has a lot of

2018
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,200
difficulty flowing through it the other

2019
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:39,920
direction

2020
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,799
you can also get um check valves that

2021
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,119
are passive and what a check valve is

2022
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,799
it's like a diode an electric circuit i

2023
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:48,079
have a drawer of them over there which i

2024
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:49,520
was just reaching for

2025
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,839
so you can see one kind of right here

2026
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,359
and it allows flow to go through one

2027
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:54,799
direction but not the other direction

2028
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,319
it'll seal backwards

2029
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:58,160
fun fact your heart is basically a whole

2030
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,520
bunch of check valves

2031
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,640
um where as it expands and contracts it

2032
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,119
can only push in one direction

2033
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,359
uh which is cool so a check valve like a

2034
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,520
diode allows flow in one direction and

2035
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,359
restricts it in the other direction

2036
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:14,079
you also have on off valves that is just

2037
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,160
is flow or not flow

2038
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,359
regulators regulate pressure output

2039
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,119
relief valves are kind of a subset of

2040
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,640
regulator and you put them in systems

2041
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,119
where

2042
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,799
you want to make sure that you vent if

2043
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,640
you get above a certain pressure

2044
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,000
so your air compressors typically have

2045
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,119
this to make sure you don't blow up your

2046
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,160
air compressor

2047
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,960
importantly throttling uh is allows you

2048
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,799
to control the amount of flow rate

2049
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:38,400
going through cool um

2050
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,480
so on off valves the one you see there

2051
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,160
on the top right is a conventional ball

2052
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,280
valve that's just a

2053
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,960
simple handle you see these in plumbing

2054
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,400
applications all the time they're really

2055
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,200
really nice

2056
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,440
you can use them to do throttling but

2057
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,799
they don't do a very good job of it

2058
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,400
there are better things for that

2059
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,039
um and they're typically hand driven you

2060
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,079
also see

2061
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:58,720
um solenoid valves down there and just

2062
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,079
some kind of like

2063
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,160
on off valves um down here toggle valves

2064
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,839
and that's a mcmaster car schematic of

2065
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:07,280
it solenoid valves are electrically

2066
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,880
controlled when they're active typically

2067
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,440
they're open

2068
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,039
and then they close when you de-energize

2069
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,520
them um you can get them by latching

2070
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,319
which i was

2071
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,000
asked and asked about that this week in

2072
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,520
an email which was great i went and

2073
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,880
looked them up they're really cool

2074
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,400
um i haven't used them really but

2075
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,000
they're super neat

2076
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,240
um they do solemnly valves do heat up

2077
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,799
significantly when active and they just

2078
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,960
chew up electrical power so they're

2079
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,559
really nice for controlling short bursts

2080
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,319
of things like pneumatic movement but

2081
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:34,480
they are not great if you want to leave

2082
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,000
them open unless you get that by

2083
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:36,640
latching

2084
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,599
alternative uh regulators are really

2085
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,039
cool so basically what you have is a

2086
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:41,520
spring

2087
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,799
and you can dial it in and out with a um

2088
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,839
with a knob um as you dial it in it's

2089
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,280
higher pressure as you pull it out it's

2090
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,160
lower pressure

2091
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,520
and that's because you're you're cr

2092
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,079
you're dialing in an amount of

2093
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,880
compression that regulates the amount of

2094
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,240
flow that goes through

2095
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,200
um and so yeah it's pretty cool and

2096
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,119
regulators also are actually a fairly

2097
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,640
effective backflow preventer

2098
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,760
which is neat um and they they typically

2099
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,599
regulate with respect to a specific

2100
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,039
pressure so in this case

2101
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,880
it's atmospheric when you're reading a

2102
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,400
regulator on a gas bottle

2103
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,440
the left one typically is how much the

2104
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,359
pressure of the bottle is

2105
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,760
um and the right one is what the output

2106
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,599
regulated pressure is

2107
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,240
so in this case you've got bar and black

2108
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,640
and psi in red

2109
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,760
so you know a typical gas bottle would

2110
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,960
arrive at about

2111
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,960
250 bar maybe 200 bar somewhere in there

2112
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,720
um and you this is kind of how much you

2113
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,039
have left in the tank and then this is

2114
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,599
you tuned by dialing that that hand knob

2115
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:44,480
in and out

2116
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,240
um to the pressure you want on the

2117
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,558
outside

2118
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:51,599
cool uh throttling valves come in a lot

2119
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,039
of different shapes and sizes for a lot

2120
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,079
of your like big

2121
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,079
uh airflow stuff you see these kind of

2122
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,200
control dampers

2123
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,880
which are kind of complicated versions

2124
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,119
of a butterfly valve a lot of times

2125
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,520
so this is our butterfly valve over here

2126
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,880
these are typically operated

2127
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,480
they can be operated as hand valves or

2128
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,240
electronically they're nice because

2129
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,440
they're rotational

2130
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,200
and they control how much flow goes

2131
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,640
through something

2132
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,400
gate valve is a similar thing it's just

2133
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,240
a thing that moves up and down

2134
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,079
so you see a manually operated one there

2135
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:19,599
but they are very commonly electrically

2136
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:20,799
actuated

2137
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,319
um and then you see this one here which

2138
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,400
is a needle valve um which

2139
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,400
when you thread it in stops flow and as

2140
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,640
you thread it out starts flow

2141
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,280
and that one's a swagelok as well neat

2142
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,000
um

2143
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,440
yeah sometimes the gate valve is also

2144
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,640
called a knife valve because that thing

2145
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:35,839
looks like a knife coming down through

2146
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:39,039
the thing don't put your fingers inside

2147
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:40,319
that's everything i went eight minutes

2148
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,240
over i'm so dreadfully sorry

2149
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,359
let's go to q a um yeah

2150
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,359
i'll start reading through the chat uh i

2151
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:48,960
do want to say engineering generally is

2152
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,160
about creativity look for those

2153
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,839
opportunities to think how to

2154
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,520
think outside the cylinder because we

2155
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,119
just talked all about pressure and stuff

2156
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:56,160
but uh

2157
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,440
yeah if if you find stuff lying around

2158
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,960
see if you can use it that's how cool

2159
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,640
inventions get made

2160
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,920
and now you know all about fluids you

2161
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,480
can build that apparatus

2162
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,839
which i showed you last week as well and

2163
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:09,599
made the exact same joke

2164
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,599
about building stuff here i am back

2165
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:14,160
making the same jokes sorry guys

2166
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,120
all right cool let's uh let's go to q a

2167
