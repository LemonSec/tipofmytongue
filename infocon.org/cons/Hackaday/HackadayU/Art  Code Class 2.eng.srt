00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:09,920
hello

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,799
and welcome to the second class in the

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:13,200
art

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,239
and code course series today

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,000
we are going to be focusing our efforts

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,199
on recursion and motion so

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,840
we're going to look deep into some

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,920
mathematical concepts that i feel are

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,400
super

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,119
important for creating striking pieces

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,479
of generative art

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,079
and we're going to look at that through

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,840
the lens of some basic

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,360
motion techniques for p5 what we will be

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,840
centering that art discussion around is

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,480
going to be

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,039
some art composition techniques and the

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,960
language of art composition

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
and art criticism i'll remind you that

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,760
in our first course we

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,680
looked at color and the structure of a

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,920
p5.js sketch as well as the structure of

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,640
this course

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,199
we're going to take a brief review tour

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,440
through some color and structure work

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,080
and then we're going to focus deep into

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,880
this recursion and motion stuff

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,720
so here we are we're going to do our

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,640
review we're going to look at art

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,760
composition techniques

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,080
my goal with this is to give you some

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,520
language around which to

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,320
look at your own art and also to look at

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,439
other people's art

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,360
we'll get more into why i think that

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,119
that language why rhetoric is really

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,000
important later on in the presentation

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,520
the next thing we're going to talk about

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,840
is recursion if you have

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,600
experience with computer science and

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,520
recursion from a theoretical

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,600
level i want you to stick around and

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,200
keep your brain on for that portion of

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,119
this lecture and that's because we're

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,720
going to be looking at recursion in an

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,479
art specific way

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,799
i think that concepts that i've learned

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,200
in computer science classes and in code

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,880
really stick with me in a different way

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,640
when i see them played out visually and

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,560
when i'm actually able to create visuals

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,240
utilizing that recursion so

54
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,640
stick around don't disappear on me the

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,759
last thing we're going to do is of

56
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,200
course the same thing that we do every

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,159
class we'll spend

58
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,960
about half of this class doing a live

59
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,000
code along

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,920
demo with me looking into these

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,520
techniques so how are we going to use

62
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,280
recursion how are we going to reflect on

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,878
our composition and how are we going to

64
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,319
bring some of the things that we learned

65
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,280
about color

66
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,000
in our last course into the motion space

67
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,160
talking about color you'll remember that

68
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,120
we looked at

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
these six color schemes these are

70
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,800
traditionally

71
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,720
the six color schemes that are taught to

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,480
our indesign students

73
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
and you can of course take this to its

74
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,959
logical extreme but every color you add

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,000
is a color that you need

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,599
to manage and a color that needs to be

77
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,200
balanced with the other colors in your

78
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,920
work

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,080
these are just a great rule of thumb for

80
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,840
finding color schemes

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,760
you should have left that course with

82
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,280
the understanding

83
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,440
of what each of these color schemes is

84
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,879
and how to code them

85
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,319
inside of a p5.js environment utilizing

86
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,840
some sort of randomness

87
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,879
for generative art if for some reason

88
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,560
you feel like you left that lecture

89
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
and you need help please come visit me

90
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
at hours i will catch you up

91
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,040
or go back and look at just those

92
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,480
sections that you feel like you need

93
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
brushing up on that's the amazing thing

94
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,159
about being able to record these

95
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,400
lectures is you can also revisit them

96
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,159
for content as much as you want and you

97
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,360
definitely don't have to watch the whole

98
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,120
thing which is magical the internet is

99
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,239
magical

100
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
so ultimately i would say

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,360
a review of these color palettes is the

102
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
more complex they get the harder they

103
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
are to balance but typically the more

104
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,680
visually

105
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,720
interesting they are it also changes

106
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,480
over time so you'll see

107
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
different trends towards different color

108
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
schemes in

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,799
each design and art industry sort of in

110
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,599
waves

111
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,760
so recently there was a big fashion

112
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
trend for monochromatic outfits

113
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
just something to look out for use your

114
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,159
color lens in your life and you will get

115
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,519
better at utilizing color in your work

116
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,200
so a review briefly of the structure of

117
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
a p5.js

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,080
sketch this is super important because

119
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,200
we're going to start utilizing a

120
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,799
different part of this structure today

121
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,319
which is why i'm drawing your attention

122
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,840
to it again

123
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,879
the part of our sketch that we spent a

124
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,879
lot of time in in the first class is the

125
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,400
setup function or

126
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,560
written function setup the setup

127
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,519
function runs

128
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,358
once when you first start your sketch

129
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,358
and then after that it stops

130
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,280
there are ways to complete a similar

131
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,120
task using the draw function which we

132
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,840
will get to

133
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,479
later on in this course but if you were

134
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,639
just looking to create a piece of still

135
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,639
generative art it would be absolutely

136
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
doable to do such things in

137
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
the setup function only

138
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
this second function the draw function

139
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,280
is the one that we're going to be

140
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,000
utilizing

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
heavily today this function runs at a

142
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,000
fixed

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,639
frame rate we'll explore how we can

144
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,360
utilize that frame rate and some basic

145
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,320
math and looping to do animation inside

146
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,759
of our sketch today

147
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,160
a brief reminder of the important parts

148
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
of any sketch in p5

149
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,479
make sure you are always creating your

150
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,000
canvas with that command

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,680
inside of your setup function it should

152
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
be the first thing you do in setup

153
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
every single time you create a sketch

154
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,680
you can declare variables

155
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
above setup you can even declare

156
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,440
functions above setup if

157
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,919
you like to see the world born um i have

158
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,479
obviously

159
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,919
my own way of structuring my code but

160
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,280
inside of your setup function

161
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,560
always the first thing you need to be

162
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,479
doing is creating your canvas

163
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,680
the canvas is pixels wide by pixels tall

164
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,199
and today we are actually going to

165
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,600
utilize these built-in variables inside

166
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,720
of p5.js

167
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
width and height these are the outputs

168
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,240
of the create canvas command so you can

169
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
utilize them later on in your code

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,479
you'll see what i mean in a bit next we

171
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,680
talked about the

172
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,199
background how to initialize the

173
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,039
background color of your canvas

174
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,759
you'll remember that this color is rgb

175
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,160
but

176
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,520
typically on the p5 web editor when it

177
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,440
just initializes a sketch for you it

178
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
initializes it in grayscale which you

179
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,479
will remember

180
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,120
is represented by a single number in the

181
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,240
rgb space in javascript

182
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,160
last we talked about a couple of basic

183
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,520
shapes there are

184
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,759
two kinds of shapes the kind that are

185
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,800
generated with

186
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,919
one point and a value like a diameter or

187
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,120
a side

188
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,800
there are the other kind of shapes where

189
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,560
you actually point out

190
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,520
each vertex of the shape so a triangle

191
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,280
would be a great example of this

192
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,240
you're actually saying i want my x1 y1

193
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,759
value to be here

194
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,840
x2 y2 x3 y3

195
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,639
so this is just a review of the concepts

196
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,919
i want to make sure you're getting out

197
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,720
of this course

198
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
every single time you sit down with me

199
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,160
today

200
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,400
we are going to focus deeply on

201
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,000
composition of course because

202
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,520
there's a huge portion of this lecture

203
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,120
devoted to composition this is where

204
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,919
you're going to get

205
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,919
most of that however we're going to

206
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,680
utilize that language throughout this

207
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,479
lecture

208
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,720
and the next two so we're not leaving it

209
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,400
behind it'll get wrapped into everything

210
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,960
we do

211
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,639
just the same as color theory will be

212
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,520
today we are also going to start looking

213
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,720
at math for art

214
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,880
so recursion is a mathematical technique

215
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,240
first and foremost we're going to talk

216
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,520
about that later

217
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,120
we will also start to introduce

218
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,280
trigonometry into this lecture but we

219
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,080
will focus

220
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,000
very heavily on that in our third

221
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
lecture which is all about

222
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,360
natural motion we're also going to

223
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,880
explore purlin noise

224
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
next week so this week we're just

225
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,880
focusing in on recursion which i think

226
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,599
is a huge

227
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,160
chunk to bite off and we'll get a little

228
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,319
bit into utilizing trigonometry for

229
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,880
animation

230
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,960
so let's talk about the principles of

231
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,240
art composition

232
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
and why they're important give you some

233
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,599
language for talking about art

234
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,000
there are two things that play into this

235
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,639
conceptual space

236
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,240
just like a house is made up of fixtures

237
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
and ornaments and windows

238
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,319
a piece of art is made up of visual

239
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,440
elements

240
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,919
and a piece of architecture might be

241
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,720
described as

242
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,720
spacious or continuous or cozy

243
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,120
those are sort of more in the space of

244
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,360
principles of composition so principles

245
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
of composition are ways of discussing

246
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,000
how a piece

247
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,080
puts itself forward and how it's

248
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,319
structured whereas visual elements are

249
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,160
the things that are being placed onto

250
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,800
your

251
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,599
art surface being put into your art

252
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,000
being

253
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,080
patterned around because all art really

254
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,879
is is generating patterns for people

255
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,519
and the ways that those things wrap into

256
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,839
an actual composition

257
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,279
so first of course we're going to talk

258
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,039
about the visual elements those

259
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,958
pieces the doors and windows of a work

260
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,799
of art

261
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,880
the first thing that gets drawn out

262
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,360
inside of this space

263
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,640
is line work so your lines are

264
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,160
a super important part of your

265
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,640
composition are they scratchy

266
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,800
are they thick are they thin do they

267
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,120
bleed what does a line look like in your

268
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,080
piece of art

269
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,240
i think this is especially important

270
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,160
inside of the digital space

271
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
in a physical space a lot of what you're

272
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,360
working with is

273
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,080
your tools so if i choose to pick up a

274
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,560
marker that marker has a bunch of inborn

275
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,279
tools

276
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,839
in p5.js you are styling each and every

277
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,440
single line that you draw so be

278
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
thinking really critically about why

279
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,959
you're selecting

280
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,120
that specific style for the line that

281
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,000
you use

282
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,680
why are they short why are they long why

283
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,240
are they continuous why are they broken

284
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,760
drawing your attention to lines is a

285
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,680
part of your artwork

286
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,839
the next thing that you can utilize to

287
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,600
create a

288
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
an engaging piece of art would be the

289
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,040
shapes so

290
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,839
shapes can obviously be what we

291
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,200
literally talked about in our last

292
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,720
course just shapes

293
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,360
but in a broader fine art sense shapes

294
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,480
can also be

295
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,080
the line of a human body or the way a

296
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,600
piece of clothing drapes

297
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,279
it's more the way a form is structured

298
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,160
and what about that contour is

299
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,079
interesting

300
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,240
tone and color are sometimes separated

301
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,760
and i want you to think about them

302
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
as separate but they have a lot to do

303
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,800
with each other

304
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,600
they stand on each other's ground so

305
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,040
tone is typically

306
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,920
used to refer to something being warm or

307
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,720
cold or

308
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,760
high contrast or high saturation or the

309
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,200
opposite of that of course

310
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
i think of this a lot in terms of

311
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,720
photoshop tools so if you have any

312
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,600
familiarity

313
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,839
with editing photographs or even on your

314
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,680
phone the way that you edit pictures

315
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,279
how are you toning your photos to change

316
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,279
the mood or to change the artistic

317
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,399
composition

318
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,480
of course this is different than color

319
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,920
so i chose to wear

320
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,200
a red shirt and a peachy headband today

321
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,519
that would be a color choice in that i

322
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,839
am going very heavily on like the

323
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,000
monochrome side of the spectrum all of

324
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,440
these colors are analogous to one

325
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,160
another

326
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
but tone wise they're quite different

327
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,320
i'm creating some sense of contrast with

328
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,800
this

329
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,000
peachy pastel like low saturation light

330
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,279
color in contrast with this very vibrant

331
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,000
red shirt so i hope that under like i

332
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
hope that tracks for you i hope that

333
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,040
understands for you i hope that tracks

334
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,680
for you

335
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,200
the difference between tone and color

336
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,120
and how they work in balance with one

337
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,560
another

338
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,800
the next visual element of art is

339
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,160
patterns so

340
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,680
patterns are a great way to create

341
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
a sense of connection between different

342
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,880
parts of your work or

343
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,040
a sense of discordant so we'll talk

344
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,120
about discordance in this next slide

345
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,440
where we actually go into the principles

346
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,800
of composition

347
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,880
patterns are things that repeat i think

348
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,000
that's pretty obvious

349
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,800
it's very much a part of our language

350
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
the word pattern and i think that brings

351
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,519
forth

352
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,399
something really obvious for you think

353
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,839
about all of the different patterns that

354
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,200
you experience every day

355
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,560
and the way that things are patterned

356
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,040
that you might not actually realize so

357
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,959
natural patterns are a big part of this

358
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,560
it can repeat but

359
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,160
maybe not regularly or it could be

360
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
completely symmetrical and mathematical

361
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,519
and copy paste so

362
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,120
just noticing patterns i think is a

363
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
great way to get to know them

364
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,839
texture is an incredibly important part

365
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,240
of

366
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,720
all artwork but again very similar to a

367
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,480
lime is something that you really have

368
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,079
to be thoughtful about when you're

369
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,360
undertaking

370
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,399
digital art so how are you pulling

371
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,240
texture into your work are you choosing

372
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,920
to go without texture are you choosing

373
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,200
to add texture

374
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
there are a lot of free textures

375
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,360
available online and i will show you

376
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
today how to pull those things off of

377
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,920
free

378
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,079
photo sharing websites i have a handful

379
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,760
that i personally like but we won't

380
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,959
consider that to be

381
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,839
any sort of like endorsement of those

382
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,120
products i'm just going to show you what

383
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,720
my process looks like for pulling

384
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,959
patterns and textures

385
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,399
last on this slide we're going to talk

386
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,560
about form form

387
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,200
is also sometimes referred to figure

388
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,760
ground

389
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,079
inside of a gestalt psychology view

390
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,760
we're not going to get into

391
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,600
that type of gestalt because i think

392
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
it's encapsulated well here

393
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,680
we will visit gestalt and motion in our

394
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,040
next course

395
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,639
however form is the shape of an

396
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,519
a body or a subject on a canvas there

397
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,800
can be

398
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,680
many subjects or one subject but how is

399
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,360
it shaped how does that line move

400
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,800
throughout your piece how much space

401
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,920
does it take up

402
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,519
is it taking up a lot of space or a

403
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,200
little space where is it placed in the

404
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,279
frame those are all considerations

405
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,680
of form so here i have the volume

406
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,440
occupied by an element and i think

407
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,160
that's

408
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,560
really driving home exactly what form is

409
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
how much space is it taking up

410
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,760
and how is that space distributed

411
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,120
throughout the piece

412
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,680
so now we get to add those things into a

413
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,880
broader

414
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,320
set of values or ways of thinking about

415
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,839
art these are the principles of

416
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,240
composition so remembering that

417
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,279
everything on this slide is

418
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,560
making up a piece that can have

419
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,720
all of these elements and does have all

420
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,959
of these elements every piece of art has

421
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,600
all of these elements and it's a matter

422
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,079
of

423
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,639
being able to discuss them in detail so

424
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,160
using these things as lenses is

425
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,240
incredibly important to understanding

426
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,399
and comparing and reflecting on your art

427
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,560
the first thing i've got here is rhythm

428
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,760
so rhythm

429
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,160
is just like a musical rhythm what's the

430
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,000
flow of the piece when your eye moves

431
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,959
across the

432
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,800
canvas or across the digital artwork

433
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,600
is it consistent does it feel jagged do

434
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,279
you feel like you're moving from one

435
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,560
side to another

436
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,440
how does your eye move so this is a very

437
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,120
a very feelings e

438
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,600
sort of lens for discussing art

439
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,639
but it seems to be universal

440
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,399
so a lot of people get the same sense of

441
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,320
rhythm out of different pieces

442
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,440
but it comes down to seeing a lot of art

443
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,519
and reflecting on the ways that you

444
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,000
you interpret that rhythm so i'll give

445
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,760
you a couple of examples and some slides

446
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,320
don't worry

447
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
these three definitely go very well

448
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,920
together which is why i've paired them

449
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,120
so balance symmetry and emphasis

450
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,160
so balance can create a sense of

451
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,120
symmetry

452
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,279
and it can also create a sense of

453
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,320
emphasis

454
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
of course we all know from elementary

455
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,399
school art class that symmetry is when

456
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,560
something is the same on either side

457
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,399
you can have radial symmetry which is

458
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,920
where things are symmetrical

459
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
spiraling out from the center in pi

460
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,199
slices

461
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,120
so that work of art that we looked at

462
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,320
last time that was

463
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,800
gray scale with the sounds of all the

464
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,399
planets in the solar system

465
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,639
would be utilizing symmetry to draw

466
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,720
attention to the differences between

467
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,160
those pieces of data for example

468
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,680
balance is more referring to

469
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,320
the way that a scene feels and

470
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,440
specifically

471
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,880
usually it has something to do with the

472
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,440
rule of thirds so the rule of thirds is

473
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,279
the number 1.6

474
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,680
it's very deeply embedded into art

475
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,920
theory especially western art theory so

476
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,759
once you start noticing you

477
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,000
noticing it excuse me you can't unnotice

478
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,279
it and

479
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,480
this sense of balance typically centers

480
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,440
around that

481
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,199
two-thirds rule so we'll talk about this

482
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,560
again in detail but

483
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,279
typically a very well balanced work of

484
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,880
art will have

485
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,399
two-thirds of the canvas dedicated to

486
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,880
one sort of section and then one-third

487
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,680
of the canvas

488
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,440
balanced with such a section emphasis

489
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,480
is typically the ways that balance and

490
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,920
symmetry are kind of

491
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,240
upended or those rules are broken in

492
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,040
some way

493
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
that draws a lot of emphasis to a

494
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,399
specific piece

495
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,320
in addition something can be be

496
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,680
emphasized with color

497
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,639
rather than form therefore an artist

498
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,920
might need to be thinking about

499
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,920
balancing with form or pattern utilizing

500
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,839
their rule of thirds so rule of thirds

501
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,240
again is just a way of conceptualizing

502
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,279
a piece of art gradation

503
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,639
refers to the flow of a piece

504
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,880
are the changes gradual or immediate

505
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,040
this could definitely refer to color

506
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,799
which is what i have an example for you

507
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,599
here

508
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,599
however it can also refer to the use of

509
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,039
pattern or

510
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,959
the use of form so are you seeing

511
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,280
something really smooth to really rough

512
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,359
are you seeing something that is really

513
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,679
bright to really dark or are you seeing

514
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,640
more of a gradual slow fade something

515
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,160
that's misty would be

516
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
quite gradated that's how you would

517
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,640
perceive it as such

518
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,200
harmony and variety i have example of

519
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,000
two

520
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,360
patterns or textures here and

521
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,280
this is really looking at the ways that

522
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,880
these things are the same or different

523
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,960
are they discordant or concordant so

524
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,080
that brings us back to what i was

525
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,760
talking about on our last slide

526
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,080
how are things getting along that also

527
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,760
has to do with our color rules from our

528
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,880
last class so

529
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,039
are these things falling into neat

530
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,120
beautiful color boxes

531
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,360
or are they inhabiting opposite spaces

532
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,480
on the color wheel

533
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,120
perhaps they feel clashy and sometimes

534
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,559
that clashing can

535
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,960
be utilized to create a sense of

536
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,320
disharmony in a piece

537
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,440
movement throughout a piece does not

538
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,720
necessarily refer to

539
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
actual movement today we're going to

540
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
utilize actual movement

541
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,480
to hold the eye and move it around the

542
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,679
canvas but

543
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,000
movement can be a sense of movement so i

544
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,320
include here this beautiful little icon

545
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,960
of a wizard's hat i think it has great

546
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,520
movement

547
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,799
in it so you can kind of see that

548
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,919
based on your preconceived notions of

549
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,080
these forms and based on the way they

550
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,559
are situated in this tiny little frame

551
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,559
they appear to be moving in some way at

552
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,240
least that's my interpretation

553
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,760
of this icon last on this frame

554
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,400
we've got proportion and scale and i

555
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,720
intentionally utilized those same colors

556
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,799
and box forms and they are

557
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,200
still within that same scale just scaled

558
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,000
down

559
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,320
to show you how different something

560
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,200
might look

561
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,160
based on the proportion and the scale so

562
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,640
this can also have to do with gradation

563
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,400
or it can have to do with harmony and

564
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,160
variety or rhythm all of these things

565
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
are leaning on each other

566
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,440
but proportion and scale i think is very

567
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,760
self-evident in language sort of like

568
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,200
how patterns are are you seeing

569
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,919
a lot of variety in the forms in the

570
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,400
piece

571
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,200
are you seeing big and small stuff like

572
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,679
that

573
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,200
so why in the heck does this matter

574
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,440
i think there can be a tendency to write

575
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
off art theory especially rhetoric like

576
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,000
this

577
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,280
as being gatekeepy or

578
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,720
being jargony and i also

579
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,039
tend to dislike jargon but these things

580
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,400
are really important and words are

581
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,440
really important

582
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,120
because they give you the ability to put

583
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,280
on a lens so now i hope when you look at

584
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,240
a piece of art

585
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,280
you're able to see all of these elements

586
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,320
of composition

587
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,160
inside of the way you are actually

588
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,080
perceiving it so instead of saying

589
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,840
i like this piece i don't like this

590
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,760
piece it looks good it doesn't look good

591
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,919
you can actually self-reflect and

592
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,159
reflect out other people on this common

593
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:06,880
ground

594
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
i like this piece because it has a lot

595
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,919
of balance and symmetry

596
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,679
i don't like this piece because i don't

597
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,400
like how disruptive the rhythm is

598
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,080
and things like that so

599
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,360
this guy france fannin is a philosopher

600
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,679
and a psychiatrist who moved around to a

601
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,600
lot of different cultures and he said

602
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
to speak a language is to take on a

603
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,039
world a culture

604
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,120
so we're learning the language of art

605
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,400
and we're learning the language of art

606
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
in order to be able to reflect on

607
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
ourselves and our relationship to this

608
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,200
culture of art

609
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,480
now we're going to take a look at a few

610
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,080
famous pieces of art and then

611
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,039
a few pieces of generative digital art

612
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,640
utilizing this frame

613
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,679
so we're going to do a little bit of

614
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,120
practice i'm going to talk to you about

615
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,039
why i picked these pieces why i think

616
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,080
they're important

617
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,480
but while we sit here and i'm jabbering

618
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,360
at you

619
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,520
take a look at this piece and just

620
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,480
reflect

621
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
what is it that you think is important

622
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,559
about it why do you think i've put it in

623
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,679
here

624
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,039
thinking back again to rhythm balance

625
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,480
and symmetry and emphasis

626
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,720
gradation harmony variety movement

627
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,840
proportion and scale

628
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,000
so while we're taking in this piece

629
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,320
uh this is caravaggio it's the

630
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,440
crucifixion of st

631
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,240
peter it was painted in 1601. there's a

632
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,760
lot of religious imagery

633
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,840
in art at this time period especially in

634
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,679
this part of the world

635
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,960
and this specific piece is telling this

636
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,600
really

637
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,640
detailed religious and symbolic story

638
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,080
utilizing color and light and contrast

639
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,840
so i think that's the biggest thing that

640
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,520
pops out at me about this piece

641
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,039
specifically

642
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,400
is the huge depth the huge

643
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,760
range in tone and the huge range in

644
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,520
brightness of the piece

645
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,720
of course there's a huge lack of balance

646
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,679
in this piece

647
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,600
everything is sort of leaning to the

648
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,799
right hand side

649
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,520
it's got a huge pull to one side of the

650
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,159
painting

651
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,159
and that gives you a sense that things

652
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,200
are

653
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,360
not going great you know there's a lot

654
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,039
of conflict in this piece

655
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,360
and not only does that have to do with

656
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,080
the actual

657
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,880
character of st peter inside of the

658
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,520
piece

659
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
but it also has to do with the way that

660
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,159
this is framed

661
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,280
i really like the deep dark

662
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,400
brown red backdrop of the

663
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,440
right-hand side of the painting i think

664
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,000
it gives the sense that they are walking

665
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,720
into

666
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,280
nowhere or walking into this deep dark

667
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,760
cove

668
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,440
almost so the lack of balance like i

669
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,840
said

670
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,240
is really about discomfort and the color

671
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,520
scheme itself

672
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,440
contributes to that balance in addition

673
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
to the forms

674
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,120
in the piece

675
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,840
here we have something completely

676
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,360
different so

677
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,120
pierre mondrian is a abstract painter

678
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,280
this was painted in 1942

679
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,240
and 1943 it's called the broadway boogie

680
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
woogie and it is one of his most famous

681
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,159
pieces so

682
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,919
he's the guy with the squares if you're

683
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,480
looking to remember your art people

684
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,360
but here i think color and pattern

685
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,080
figure

686
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,400
really heavily in the way i perceive the

687
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
piece so there's huge contrast

688
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,280
everything is super saturated saturation

689
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,559
to me feels very

690
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,840
energetic and not busy but just like it

691
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,039
brings a lot of

692
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,760
energy to the piece the repeating

693
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,880
patterns are

694
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,080
regular but unbalanced so you see

695
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,120
like the left-hand side here has three

696
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
lines whereas the right-hand side has

697
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,159
four

698
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,159
there's little breaks inside of the

699
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,279
symmetry of this piece

700
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,440
which again contributes to a sense of

701
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,720
motion

702
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,320
whereas we have these beautiful little

703
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,760
repeating patterns

704
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,600
that are kind of squished together in

705
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
some places and far apart in other

706
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,000
places

707
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,320
this looks a lot like flocking behavior

708
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,960
in human beings and animals

709
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,400
which i think is a great use of

710
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,440
pattern and a break from pattern

711
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,799
to create a sense of of motion

712
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,799
and of representation in this beautiful

713
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,640
little abstract piece of art

714
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,159
and by little i don't mean little

715
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,799
mondrion's canvases are quite big

716
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,240
you should look them up next we have one

717
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
of my personal favorite artists frida

718
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,200
kahlo

719
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,480
and she is a surrealist painter from

720
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,120
the kind of the same time period as

721
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,960
laundry on just a little before

722
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,919
this painting was painted in 1932 and

723
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,520
this is when she was laying

724
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,799
sick kind of towards the end of her life

725
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,559
so here she's utilizing scale

726
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,360
to draw emphasis to things that maybe

727
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,720
wouldn't typically be

728
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,360
this large or figure this this

729
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,159
importantly

730
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,400
inside of a piece if they were at scale

731
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,880
so she's utilizing surrealist

732
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,840
scale to tell a story of the piece i

733
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,559
also

734
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,720
really like these buildings back in the

735
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,039
background she gives a huge sense of

736
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:05,919
setting but there's

737
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,360
this really really empty space and these

738
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,080
long

739
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,880
shadows that don't exactly correlate to

740
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,960
everything on the horizon

741
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,159
and there's something really strange and

742
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,440
unsettling about

743
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,240
the selective use of light the

744
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,480
non-natural use of light in this piece

745
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,039
and i think it's a really important part

746
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,559
of her work

747
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,919
so she's utilizing

748
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,240
things that would traditionally be used

749
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,200
to make something look

750
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,440
real but she's utilizing them in ways

751
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,000
that sort of bend reality

752
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,480
now we're going to turn our view just

753
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,200
briefly

754
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,919
to a couple of generative art pieces

755
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:48,799
that i think

756
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,840
drive home at the same concept this one

757
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,120
is a little challenging for me

758
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,200
personally to look at on a screen

759
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,799
i think these lines are a little close

760
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,720
together but there is something

761
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,200
really cool about the way that it plays

762
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,400
with your eye

763
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
that sense of perfection is something

764
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,480
that you find a lot in our

765
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,520
modernist excuse me painters around the

766
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,679
same time as mondrian was painting

767
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,400
but the digital space just gives you an

768
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,120
absolute

769
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,320
sharp sense of perfection that is almost

770
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,480
impossible to achieve on a canvas

771
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,279
so this use of repeating lines creates a

772
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,000
rhythm

773
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,080
but the rhythm becomes irregular with

774
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,600
those other lines breaking it up so

775
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,279
we've got lines that are spaced exactly

776
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,159
the same

777
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,279
but they're creating forms by using this

778
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,679
trick in your brain that things that

779
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,720
look the same

780
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,480
tend to be associated as a part of a

781
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,640
figure so this is utilizing continuity

782
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,480
which is a gestalt principle

783
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,120
to create forms inside of this repeating

784
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,320
pattern

785
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,919
i also love the balance here in this

786
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,240
piece it's definitely utilizing rule of

787
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,000
thirds so

788
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,840
we're leaning heavily towards this part

789
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,080
of the painting

790
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,240
but things are quite balanced because we

791
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,000
have these shapes here

792
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,799
that kind of balance out here and oh

793
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,520
sorry

794
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,360
these shapes here which balance here so

795
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,279
there's a lot of balance inside of this

796
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,480
piece

797
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,320
even though there's that huge contrast

798
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,279
in these very simple patterns

799
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,400
next we've got this beautiful

800
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,520
piece of motion graphic art so

801
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,120
this guy patrick k huebner

802
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,440
is utilizing these repeating shapes

803
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,200
utilizing a pattern

804
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,919
and creating contrast inside of that

805
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:30,399
pattern

806
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,120
to give this optical illusion of

807
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,720
movement throughout the piece so just

808
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,399
remember these are just ovals

809
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,640
rotating but because of the way your eye

810
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,480
perceives this art piece there's this

811
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,600
beautiful sense of

812
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,880
true rhythm in the piece and

813
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,440
a sense of form because of the contrast

814
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,120
between those two pieces

815
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,039
or between those rotating circles

816
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,679
so here we are we're about halfway

817
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,080
through our lecture right now

818
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,760
and we are going to talk briefly about

819
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,200
recursion and then we're going to get

820
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,559
into our demos

821
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,360
but before we do that i have a little

822
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,159
mini demo

823
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,840
for you i think we're going to break

824
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,360
this up a bit

825
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,320
and we're going to look into moving

826
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,039
patterns

827
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,279
and just like sort of the basics of

828
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,679
movement in p5.js

829
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,880
so meet me over at your p5 editor so

830
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,559
again that's editor.p5js.org

831
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,840
and we are going to create a little work

832
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,720
of motion graphic here

833
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,320
first i am going to leave my background

834
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,440
here for now

835
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,520
but i'm going to change it all the way

836
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,480
to white

837
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,159
and you'll see why we're doing that in a

838
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,520
bit

839
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,679
the next thing we are going to do is

840
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,120
create a grid

841
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,720
of squares so in order to create a grid

842
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,880
of squares we're going to utilize a loop

843
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,600
function inside of javascript this is a

844
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,200
common form of code

845
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,880
and it's really useful in generative art

846
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,600
for creating

847
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,919
repeating elements so loops are

848
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,120
something that

849
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
repeat until they meet a stopping

850
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,039
condition they're slightly different

851
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,799
than recursive code and we'll get into

852
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,200
why

853
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,679
in a few moments but right now we're

854
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,200
just going to

855
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,039
create a single square because i'm going

856
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,880
to talk you through a new way of

857
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,559
moving squares around the canvas so

858
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,320
let's just do a square

859
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,360
at 0 0 with a

860
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,960
size of size so i'm going to initialize

861
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,840
a variable

862
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,039
to control the size of our squares so

863
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,919
that later on

864
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,200
in this exploration we can jimmy with

865
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,640
that and change it

866
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,000
and see what we think of it also because

867
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,760
this is just going to be a plain white

868
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,240
line

869
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
on a plane or a plain black line on a

870
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,679
plain white canvas i'm going to give it

871
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,159
just a little bit more thickness in that

872
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,320
stroke so to do that we're going to

873
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,520
utilize the stroke

874
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,960
weight command and let's see what we end

875
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,840
up with here

876
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,520
so just a square at 0 0

877
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,840
of size 50. very easy very

878
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,000
self-explanatory

879
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,919
now we are going to translate this

880
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,679
square

881
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,600
stick with me because this is a very

882
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,520
important part of using the loop to move

883
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,880
things around the canvas so there's a

884
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,559
reason why we're doing this

885
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,080
and let's do width divided by 2 for our

886
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,360
x condition

887
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,240
and height divided by 2 for our y

888
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,399
condition

889
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,679
now we've moved our square

890
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,679
to 200 pixels in

891
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,320
and 200 pixels down but i'm going to

892
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,159
draw your attention to the fact that

893
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,120
this square

894
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,240
is actually outside of the center of my

895
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,279
canvas

896
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,399
the reason that's happening is that

897
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,440
we are utilizing a rectangle mode inside

898
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,559
of p5.js that does not account for the

899
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,039
center

900
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,000
of the square so just for peace of mind

901
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,519
and because i think it makes this

902
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,360
specific exercise easier

903
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,080
we're going to do rect mode and we're

904
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,720
going to say

905
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,120
center now this is all in capital

906
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,399
letters

907
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,120
anytime in p5.js you're passing some

908
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,240
sort of condition

909
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,440
into a p5 function a built in you want

910
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,880
to make sure that everything is in all

911
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,360
caps

912
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,320
that's a pretty standard p5 procedure

913
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,039
okay

914
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,799
so we've got our square we've got our

915
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,480
translate the last thing we're going to

916
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,360
learn how to do

917
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,200
is actually rotate things inside of p5

918
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,720
and wow rotate we're going to rotate

919
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,200
this

920
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,720
by the frame count

921
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,720
so what's happening here is that p5.js

922
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,320
is running at 60 frames per second

923
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,360
and it's rotating our square

924
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,640
by that amount utilizing radians so

925
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,240
p5.js is always working in radian mode

926
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,840
until you change it

927
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,159
we're gonna slow it down a little bit by

928
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,279
using angle mode

929
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,640
and changing it to degrees

930
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,120
and you'll see a change right away it's

931
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,640
going to slow down that square

932
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,320
so now we're doing out of 365 60 frames

933
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,120
per second

934
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,159
so we're going around this loop much

935
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,080
much much slower as opposed to doing it

936
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,000
in radians which is two pi

937
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,600
so we were basically going around the

938
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,120
loop like

939
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,240
twice or once every two seconds

940
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,120
and change three seconds and change

941
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,559
hopefully that's right

942
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,320
um hopefully i didn't just embarrass

943
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,760
myself with math

944
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,080
uh okay so now we've got our square

945
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,360
we've got it translated

946
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,519
to width two and height two and then

947
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,200
we're going to rotate that square

948
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,039
just briefly let's see what happens if

949
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,840
we move this rotate command to above the

950
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,600
translate

951
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,760
all right so now you see that we are

952
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,440
actually rotating

953
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,360
around the point 0 0 that's because

954
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,840
we did the rotation before we did the

955
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,799
translation

956
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,799
so if you ever feel like you're getting

957
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,640
an effect you don't want to with the

958
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,080
translate and rotate

959
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,919
just try flipping them around and

960
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,600
usually that'll solve your problem

961
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,159
so just for today the effect we're going

962
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,080
for happens to be one where everybody

963
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,600
rotates in their place

964
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,799
so we're going to move this back to

965
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,000
where it goes in this piece

966
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,399
all right so the next thing we're going

967
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,840
to do is create

968
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,080
our loop first we want things to move

969
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,640
across and then we want things to move

970
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,120
down

971
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,640
so essentially in a loop we're going to

972
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,159
make a line

973
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,760
of squares and then we're going to take

974
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,440
that line and pick it up and move it

975
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,960
down our canvas

976
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,240
and make copies of it so our first loop

977
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,840
we need to build is the one that puts

978
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
our squares horizontally across our

979
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,799
canvas

980
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,200
we're gonna do four this is just the way

981
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,559
a for loop is structured

982
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,440
and then typically the first

983
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,960
alphanumeric character that you put

984
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,559
inside of a loop is i

985
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,919
so we're going to follow convention on

986
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,919
that i want

987
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,519
my squares

988
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,320
excuse me i just forgot the name of that

989
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,279
shape

990
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,840
to be

991
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,639
spread across our canvas by a fixed

992
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,760
amount

993
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,079
so i'm going to initialize a variable

994
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,320
called spread

995
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,760
and then i'm going to set our spread to

996
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,560
100.

997
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,280
obviously right now nothing has happened

998
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,040
and what is actually

999
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,679
happening here is we're drawing all of

1000
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,520
our squares inside of this single

1001
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,440
location so we need to make sure

1002
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,760
that our translate command makes its way

1003
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,639
inside

1004
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,280
of our function just a reminder that of

1005
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,560
course you want your rotate to stick

1006
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,000
with your translate if you want things

1007
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,040
to rotate in place and now we are going

1008
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,679
to

1009
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,199
translate our squares

1010
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,560
see this is kind of the amazing thing

1011
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,639
about art is you can

1012
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,640
move things around and explore with them

1013
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,960
and see how they end up

1014
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,880
right now we are going to change our

1015
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,000
translate

1016
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,040
so that we are translating by i

1017
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,920
each time i is going up by the amount

1018
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,240
that we want our squares spread apart

1019
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,079
so now we've got our squares spread

1020
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,000
apart by 100

1021
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,880
and we've got squares that are size 50.

1022
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,200
but you'll notice here that we are still

1023
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,400
kind of like randomly rotating our

1024
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,160
squares around an axis they're all

1025
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,640
rotating around zero zero right now

1026
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,599
and that's because every time we run

1027
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,200
this loop we are adding

1028
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,320
to the rotate and translate so what we

1029
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,760
are actually going to do

1030
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,440
is utilize this command push

1031
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,960
and this command pop

1032
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,839
now push and pop make it so that we are

1033
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,040
returning back to zero we are resetting

1034
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,000
each time we run this loop so now

1035
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,720
instead of

1036
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,680
translating by i and adding that each

1037
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,480
time

1038
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,560
and rotating by frame count and adding

1039
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,839
that each time

1040
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,520
we are moving each of our squares by

1041
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,839
i and then we are rotating them all by

1042
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,040
frame count

1043
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,079
so we need to again like i said before

1044
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,320
take this work that we've already done

1045
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,400
our line of rotating squares and we want

1046
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,599
to just pick it up

1047
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,000
and copy it down so the way that i would

1048
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,960
go for that

1049
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,800
is to create another for loop

1050
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,920
i'm going to add a tab to this just so

1051
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,680
it's a little farther out

1052
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,160
and then traditionally your for loop is

1053
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,960
going to be

1054
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,560
j and then this is going to be height

1055
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,880
because we're doing our y direction

1056
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,320
we're going to add the same amount of

1057
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:42,800
spread

1058
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,280
because they're squares and utilizing

1059
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
our art composition principles i want

1060
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,119
everybody to be equally spaced and

1061
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,240
equally sized

1062
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,520
so we're going to utilize the same

1063
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,440
spread that we did for our other side of

1064
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,320
the grid

1065
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,920
and then i'm going to add

1066
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,560
spread each time we run our loop so

1067
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,000
right now we are telling this

1068
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,320
to run from the number zero

1069
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,440
we're gonna add the spread

1070
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,359
to j and then we're going to stop as

1071
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,800
soon as j is

1072
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,760
the height and the width plus the spread

1073
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,560
the reason i added spread to the height

1074
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,800
is so that we're going off of the canvas

1075
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,240
if i was going to go just to the height

1076
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,520
and the width we would

1077
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,200
cut off just a little bit before the

1078
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,560
edge

1079
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,400
all right so the last thing we need to

1080
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,040
do here to create our

1081
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,720
squares that move across the canvas is

1082
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,160
just to translate by j

1083
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,839
each time we loop as well just a

1084
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,920
reminder if i removed that push and pop

1085
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,560
command

1086
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,160
things would go completely haywire and

1087
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,119
that's because i'd be adding to

1088
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,320
each movement with the next movement so

1089
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,839
translate as an additive command

1090
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:53,119
and we need to make sure that we are

1091
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,800
starting from zero and then adding in

1092
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,240
that i and j each and every time

1093
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,800
so just to make sure i'm driving home

1094
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,760
this concept

1095
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,640
of the push and pop and why we're

1096
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,800
utilizing it inside of this space

1097
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
i'm going to show you how i would create

1098
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,680
a grid if i was going to use

1099
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,760
translate without utilizing this push

1100
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,800
and pop command

1101
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,480
so you'll remember what we're doing with

1102
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,079
push and pop is basically resetting

1103
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,079
translate to zero each and every time we

1104
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,280
run this loop

1105
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,119
if for some reason i wanted to create a

1106
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,200
grid and not utilize push and pop

1107
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,720
which would not work if i wanted to

1108
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
rotate utilizing frame count i'll drive

1109
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,160
that home for you so that's why we're

1110
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,480
using it in this specific situation

1111
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
but it's very possible to create a grid

1112
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,079
utilizing

1113
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,119
just loops without push pop

1114
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,440
so i usually use my control and then

1115
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,200
backslash button or command if you're on

1116
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,000
a mac

1117
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,720
just to comment out my code now i'm

1118
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,680
going to create a

1119
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,279
very similar for loop

1120
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,040
and i'll even do the same

1121
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,319
counters

1122
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,200
for this first one i am going to

1123
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,000
translate

1124
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,599
by spread

1125
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,400
each time and then by zero so this is

1126
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,680
going to create

1127
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,200
a row of squares just like what we had

1128
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
moving across the top of the screen and

1129
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,040
that's because we're adding spread

1130
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,920
each and every time we run this loop so

1131
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,760
let me create for you a couple of

1132
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,160
squares

1133
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,119
and then now we see the squares running

1134
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,440
along the right hand side of my screen

1135
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
of course we are translating by spread

1136
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,119
before we draw the square so if i was

1137
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,720
going to be true to form i would want to

1138
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,960
translate after i draw so i'm draw move

1139
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,160
draw move

1140
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,440
inside of this loop now we've got a very

1141
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,280
similar effect to the one we had before

1142
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,040
last but not least we would want to

1143
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,800
create our nested

1144
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:11,839
loop utilizing j

1145
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,839
now here's where things get a little bit

1146
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,160
trickier uh you have to use your brain

1147
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,839
in kind of a different way

1148
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,839
we are going to translate our squares

1149
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,960
in the y direction by spread

1150
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,359
technically after each and every loop

1151
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,640
oop what's going on here

1152
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,000
unexpected token let me just do a quick

1153
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,880
little oh

1154
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,920
we're missing that all right cool

1155
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,280
so now you see here that i

1156
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,400
am translating by

1157
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,599
spread and then moving down the canvas

1158
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,119
let's try moving our spread

1159
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,640
to the bottom

1160
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,040
oh i see what's going on so here we are

1161
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,160
resetting to zero

1162
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,000
each and every time we translate in that

1163
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,079
direction

1164
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,319
the easiest way to get around this would

1165
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,599
be

1166
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,760
to

1167
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,960
create a counter variable for x and y

1168
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,480
and utilize that on each loop so

1169
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,200
instead of doing just spread i'd be

1170
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,640
actually adding to the counter every

1171
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,200
time

1172
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,880
now you're kind of seeing why we're

1173
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,640
utilizing that push and pop it's kind of

1174
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,680
just a

1175
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,079
an efficient way to go about moving

1176
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,359
through the grid space

1177
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,200
i strongly recommend that you use that

1178
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,400
inside of your loop so i think it's

1179
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,839
super efficient

1180
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,760
so if you're looking for a little bit of

1181
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,280
an extra challenge take this

1182
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,000
to where it needs to go to create a grid

1183
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,200
i need

1184
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,520
one more thing which is a specific

1185
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
variable for x and y

1186
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,040
that is increasing each and every time

1187
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,400
great okay let's return to

1188
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,960
our loop the last thing we're going to

1189
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
do is just add a little bit of color to

1190
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,760
this piece

1191
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,240
right now it's kind of bland it's really

1192
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,319
cool i love the black and white that has

1193
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:10,960
its own

1194
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,920
merits but i think what's really cool

1195
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,560
about

1196
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,119
doing some color additive color inside

1197
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,000
of our

1198
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,480
draw function is that you can see the

1199
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,760
way that the frame count

1200
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,720
is increasing throughout the piece so

1201
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,880
i'm just going to do

1202
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,000
s curl which is the color of my

1203
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,359
stroke and then

1204
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,240
we'll initialize that variable in setup

1205
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,240
last we are going to make our stroke

1206
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,560
i'm going to use the color red and then

1207
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,280
just as

1208
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,640
dark as possible so no green no blue

1209
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,119
right now everything is at zero so i

1210
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,160
want to increase

1211
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,160
my stroke color each and every time we

1212
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
loop so those two plus signs

1213
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,720
is just me telling the sketch every time

1214
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,319
you go through a loop every time you get

1215
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,520
to a new frame

1216
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,400
add one to s color so if i restart this

1217
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,000
a couple times you can see

1218
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,520
my s color increasing with the frame

1219
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,160
rate

1220
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,760
that also gives you a really great

1221
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,960
built-in sense of how fast that's going

1222
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,359
cool so we've learned a little bit about

1223
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,119
doing some basic animation

1224
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,560
and bringing some of the things we

1225
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,720
learned about art composition inside

1226
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,720
of our frame using repeating function so

1227
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,599
here we're using

1228
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,480
for loops to create a grid and then

1229
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,280
we're

1230
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,359
rotating that grid which i think is so

1231
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,920
cool and then we're changing

1232
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,599
the color of these objects

1233
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,440
cool so returning to our lecture

1234
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,319
let's talk just super briefly about

1235
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,119
recursion

1236
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,800
wire recursion is important and then

1237
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,520
i'll show you how to utilize recursion

1238
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,079
inside

1239
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,960
of a generative art piece i put here

1240
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,160
that it's the special sauce of

1241
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,240
generative art i truly believe that

1242
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,240
just about anything i see where i think

1243
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,000
wow that's really remarkable

1244
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,880
i am totally taken by that piece it's

1245
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,480
utilizing some kind of

1246
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,560
looping or recursion but nine times out

1247
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,079
of ten it's something recursive because

1248
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,359
recursion is just a really cool

1249
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,200
mathematical concept

1250
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,240
so what is recursion again it's

1251
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,240
it's math it's a mathematical concept

1252
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,000
where a series is defined

1253
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,720
in terms of itself or a number similar

1254
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,599
to itself

1255
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,440
the classic example of this is the

1256
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,440
fibonacci sequence but

1257
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,240
n equals n minus 1 is a perfectly valid

1258
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,079
example so we're referencing n

1259
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,920
inside of our function but we're

1260
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,400
referencing it in a changed way

1261
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
one thing of note about recursion in

1262
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,599
computer programming

1263
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,800
this is infinite n equals n minus one

1264
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,160
and you never want to create an

1265
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,640
infinite an infinite loop inside of your

1266
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,200
code

1267
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,319
so you always want to make sure your

1268
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,079
recursion has a stopping condition or

1269
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,000
something that slows it so the recursion

1270
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,079
that we are going to explore today

1271
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,880
is time dependent that's our slowing

1272
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,480
condition or our stopping condition

1273
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,079
you can't have an infinite loop if

1274
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,119
you're always changing by frame rate

1275
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,200
so this is an example of the fibonacci

1276
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,800
sequence basically

1277
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,400
the same thing as the golden mean which

1278
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,680
we talked about earlier it's another way

1279
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,720
of math

1280
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,119
mathematically representing this number

1281
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,480
the golden mean

1282
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,040
and it's very common inside of

1283
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,160
renaissance art

1284
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,920
because it was just kind of a part of

1285
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,319
the public consciousness at that time

1286
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,640
and you see it represented here so

1287
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,920
basically what you're doing is you're

1288
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,880
taking

1289
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,680
the number before the number and then

1290
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,319
you're taking

1291
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,560
that number before that number and then

1292
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,079
you're adding those two numbers together

1293
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:36,960
so

1294
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,319
1 and 1 is 2 and then

1295
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,920
2 and 1 is 3 and so on and so on and so

1296
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,640
forth

1297
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,400
so definitely go look up fibonacci if

1298
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,920
you're interested it's just

1299
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,000
the classic example of recursion

1300
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,119
recursion i think for most people who

1301
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,040
have computer programming experience is

1302
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,079
associated with

1303
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,040
solving a specific subset of problems

1304
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,720
the problem that you typically

1305
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,880
see in a computer science class solved

1306
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,280
with recursion is the tower of hanoi

1307
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,040
and you're seeing that played out here

1308
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,960
so the problem is essentially

1309
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,920
there are three pegs there is a stack of

1310
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,480
disks

1311
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,200
i want to move the disks from one peg to

1312
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:17,920
another

1313
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,280
without putting a disk that is larger on

1314
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,200
top of a disk that is smaller

1315
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,440
and you utilize that recursive function

1316
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,480
to move

1317
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,040
these disks around in a repeating

1318
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,839
pattern

1319
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,480
to free the base and then as you're

1320
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,520
seeing here

1321
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,599
sort of move everything back into the

1322
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,520
order it is meant to be

1323
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,359
we're not going to get into the solution

1324
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,280
of this problem today

1325
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,440
i think that it's totally worth looking

1326
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,280
into if you want to spend that time we

1327
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,200
just are time limited right now so just

1328
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,400
go youtube it

1329
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,560
go google it what is the solution to

1330
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,520
tower of hanoi

1331
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,200
in javascript specifically if that's

1332
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,400
what you're interested in and you've

1333
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,319
never been exposed to this problem

1334
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,440
it's definitely worth looking into

1335
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,640
in terms of art recursion is

1336
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,200
a pattern and movement that's creating a

1337
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,040
rhythm inside of your art piece so this

1338
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,359
is a beautiful little piece of recursion

1339
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,680
we're basically infinitely falling into

1340
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,200
the simpsons hole here

1341
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,520
so we are going to aim for something

1342
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,119
that's kind of like this

1343
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,480
inside of our recursive pieces

1344
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,000
so let's do it let's go generate

1345
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,640
some recursive motion right now we are

1346
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,400
working with this sketch i

1347
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,079
recommend you save it we're going to

1348
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,559
open a brand new fresh one

1349
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,760
to get to work on our recursion so

1350
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,079
again basically what we're going for is

1351
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:38,880
something that looks

1352
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,359
exactly like this simpsons piece if you

1353
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,160
ever see

1354
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,280
something like this it's recursion

1355
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,119
straight up that's the only way that you

1356
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,720
can create something that looks like

1357
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,440
this where you're

1358
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,119
infinitely falling into a repeating

1359
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,640
pattern forever

1360
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,640
so we're not going to do that we're

1361
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,079
going to do something much more simple

1362
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:56,880
than that

1363
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,319
but it's going to teach you the

1364
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,319
principles of creating a recursive

1365
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:00,880
function

1366
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,800
so that you can explore that in the

1367
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,079
future

1368
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,520
you're going to be so surprised at how

1369
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,200
simple this is it's the coolest thing

1370
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,079
like

1371
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,599
it is magic to me so

1372
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,079
we are going to create a function this

1373
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,720
function

1374
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,200
does one thing and one thing only and

1375
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,599
that is draw a circle

1376
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,240
this circle has a couple of conditions

1377
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,839
we need to know the x position

1378
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,440
the y position the radius and then

1379
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,280
we need to know the stroke weight

1380
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,920
in fact we'll come back to stroke weight

1381
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,040
all we need to know

1382
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,200
is the x position the y position and the

1383
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,160
radius

1384
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,440
cool we are initializing our canvas

1385
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,599
we have a background we have our

1386
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,599
canvas drawn and now we're creating a

1387
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:48,720
draw circle function

1388
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,880
so just the same as our draw and setup

1389
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,839
functions we

1390
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,000
open our function with these brackets

1391
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,839
and then inside of our function

1392
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:59,119
we are going to give our circle

1393
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,079
a stroke i'm going to make our stroke

1394
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,040
255

1395
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,119
so white which also means to add some

1396
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,400
contrast to the piece i'm going to make

1397
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,559
this just a little darker

1398
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,880
the next thing i'm going to do is add no

1399
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,480
fill

1400
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,559
no fill will just make all of our shapes

1401
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,079
empty we're going to focus just on the

1402
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,839
stroke today

1403
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,160
next we are going to create we're going

1404
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,000
to use the ellipse command get a little

1405
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,359
wild

1406
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,720
utilizing x y r and r

1407
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,640
so ellipse is basically the same as a

1408
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,720
circle only it can be wide and tall

1409
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,319
we are just going to create an ellipse

1410
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,839
that is the same width as

1411
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,160
height but if you wanted to take this

1412
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,400
function into an ellipse direction

1413
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,000
you could do that too so we're setting

1414
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,160
it up in a much more broad way

1415
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,440
okay now we can use

1416
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,480
our function to call the function inside

1417
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,599
of itself

1418
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,280
i suppose before we do that we should

1419
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,599
just test to make sure it works right so

1420
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,559
let's go ahead and draw ourselves

1421
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,800
a circle remember we are doing

1422
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,040
and then i am going to create a

1423
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,720
variable called radius

1424
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,480
so that i can change it outside of this

1425
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,280
function call

1426
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,000
which is best practice for later

1427
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,400
we'll initialize our radius at the value

1428
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,200
we want it to be

1429
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,319
let's say 10 and then

1430
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,079
let's see what we get here beautiful

1431
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,480
we have a circle drawn in the center of

1432
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,520
our canvas

1433
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,559
that is a radius of 10.

1434
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,200
it's exactly what we're looking for so

1435
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,319
the next thing we're going to do is

1436
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,040
actually

1437
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,760
call in some recursion into our function

1438
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,440
you will remember that we need to have a

1439
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,040
stopping condition

1440
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,559
and that is true here as well because we

1441
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,000
want to make sure that we don't

1442
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,960
overload our computer inside of this

1443
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,960
recursive beautiful space

1444
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,839
so our stopping condition is going to be

1445
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,240
we never want a circle to be drawn

1446
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,440
if its radius is greater than 40.

1447
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,800
so basically what we're going to do is

1448
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,559
we're going to take our radius we're

1449
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:11,680
going to increase

1450
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,319
its size and then we want to make sure

1451
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:15,200
that our radius

1452
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,520
never gets any bigger than 40.

1453
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,480
so if that's true if our radius

1454
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,760
is oh yikes

1455
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,119
i'm backwards if our radius is

1456
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,839
less than 40 we are going to draw a

1457
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,280
circle

1458
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,160
and we're going to draw our circle at x

1459
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:40,720
plus

1460
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,160
r y

1461
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,520
r times 2

1462
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,880
and basically what we're going to see

1463
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,280
here yeah is our circle

1464
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,760
moving outward and then getting larger

1465
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,520
so i hope this is tracking for you

1466
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,119
basically we're not drawing our circles

1467
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,800
bigger than 40 so this is

1468
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,839
smaller than 40 radius and then

1469
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,520
each time we draw our circle we're going

1470
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,839
to move out by radius and we're going to

1471
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,680
increase the radius so that's how we

1472
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,680
approach our stopping condition

1473
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,720
i think i'd like to make this just like

1474
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,160
bigger so we can go farther next

1475
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,200
i think that because we're looking for

1476
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,400
something that has

1477
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,280
a beautiful and balanced composition we

1478
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,880
should repeat the same process

1479
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,079
in all four cardinal directions so let's

1480
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,359
draw a circle at x

1481
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,640
minus r y and then r

1482
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,040
times two so we'll see the same thing

1483
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,480
wow that's so cool

1484
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,760
on both sides of our screen and then

1485
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,800
i was gonna draw vertically as well

1486
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,559
if you were to do that you would just go

1487
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,000
ahead and do the same thing except for

1488
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,520
in the y condition so we'd keep

1489
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,800
x fixed we would add r and then we'd

1490
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
multiply our r by 2.

1491
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,400
so you'll see that i'm moving into the y

1492
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,760
direction

1493
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,400
however i think this is getting a little

1494
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,599
busy

1495
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,119
so we're going to keep it simple and

1496
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,400
we're going to move only in the x

1497
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,240
direction and in the interest of keeping

1498
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,839
it even more simple i'm going to

1499
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,359
max out our circles at a little bit

1500
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,079
smaller size and maybe spread them out a

1501
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,160
bit more so we'll do like two times r

1502
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,240
instead yeah that looks great

1503
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,440
okay so cool so the

1504
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,440
thing we need to do to add some sort of

1505
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,800
animation

1506
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,160
to our piece

1507
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,960
is we need to change our radius size

1508
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,040
utilizing the frame count

1509
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,960
so let's explore a radius

1510
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,000
that is i don't know

1511
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,040
let's do like

1512
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,839
[Music]

1513
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,680
hmm

1514
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,800
something like this cool okay

1515
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,880
it goes a little fast so let's slow it

1516
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,040
down a bit just so we can all like

1517
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,800
process what's going on here cool

1518
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,200
i think that's super cool the only thing

1519
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,520
that i don't like about this

1520
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,559
is the way that we get sucked into the

1521
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:17,440
center circle

1522
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,680
just like you would see in that simpsons

1523
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,640
piece

1524
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,119
and then now it's kind of gone which is

1525
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,160
a shame

1526
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,440
so we could improve that

1527
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,280
by potentially increasing

1528
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,680
the size so that'll make it take a

1529
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,800
little bit longer

1530
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,839
we could improve that by making it even

1531
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,319
slower

1532
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:39,920
i'm going to propose however that we

1533
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,920
improve that by utilizing sine

1534
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,599
and cosine so i'm going to use sine

1535
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,720
you'll remember from your old school

1536
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,680
math class

1537
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,720
that sine is

1538
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,200
a number that varies between 1 and

1539
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,079
negative 1

1540
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,520
as is cosine so basically it's a wave

1541
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,119
and we're using this wave function to go

1542
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,880
close and far and close and far or at

1543
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,640
least to simulate the experience of

1544
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,880
close and far and close and far

1545
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,200
so i think it's going a bit fast for us

1546
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,640
the best way to do that is the same way

1547
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,240
we solved this problem before

1548
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,720
which is changing the angle mode to

1549
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,279
degrees

1550
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,599
so now we're moving at a rate that is

1551
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,200
going around the 360

1552
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,520
angle rather than looking at the rate

1553
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,480
that is

1554
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,520
two pi so we're going much slower now so

1555
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,559
now you can see we kind of like go big

1556
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,960
and then we should reach a peak and then

1557
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,920
come back down

1558
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,680
you just have to trust me it's taking my

1559
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,960
computer a while it's starting to get

1560
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,599
tired

1561
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:46,960
hopefully you see the same thing on your

1562
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,520
screen okay

1563
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,000
so this is a great way to explore

1564
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,119
recursion

1565
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,680
i might take this even farther on my own

1566
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,720
time

1567
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,280
you could also go ahead and flip-flop

1568
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,880
this that's another great way to add

1569
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,160
some tweaking so

1570
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,879
instead of

1571
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,119
doing less than we're going to do

1572
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,000
greater than

1573
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,240
we're going to subtract r and then

1574
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,720
we are going to divide r by two so

1575
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,119
instead of our stopping condition being

1576
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,799
related to how big things get we're

1577
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,000
gonna make our stopping condition

1578
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,079
related how small things get

1579
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,319
and then of course because we've got a

1580
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,000
radius of 10

1581
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,119
i'm going to start us up a little bigger

1582
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,799
not 600 holy cow 60.

1583
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,559
and then i'm going to make our minimum

1584
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,559
or our

1585
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,559
maximum radius closer to

1586
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,559
let's say 100

1587
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,280
so now we see a totally different effect

1588
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:55,680
but

1589
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,640
still recursion so we're seeing things

1590
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,359
zooming in

1591
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,680
getting bigger and then now because

1592
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,200
we're using the sine function

1593
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,520
we're going to eventually zoom out on

1594
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,040
our screen

1595
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,200
just for the sake of time let me speed

1596
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,960
this up for you just a bit so we can all

1597
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,839
see the full

1598
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:15,440
effect cool so it goes up and then it

1599
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,559
goes back

1600
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,280
and i can tweak all of these numbers so

1601
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,000
i could do like 400

1602
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,839
just to see a different effect out of

1603
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:26,079
this

1604
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,599
i hope that makes sense for you i hope

1605
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,680
you understand how recursion sort of

1606
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,640
works

1607
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,680
um again sort of with the spinning

1608
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,240
squares

1609
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,119
you could take this and go incredibly

1610
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,240
far with it

1611
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,319
so it's all a matter of just exploring

1612
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:45,520
kind of what you feel called to explore

1613
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,839
and doing some art so just doing some

1614
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,920
play and seeing kind of what

1615
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,720
comes out of it so again i'm at office

1616
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,520
hours if you need

1617
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,359
anything from me i'd love to help you

1618
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,040
with your code but this is just

1619
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,960
a basic overview of the ways that you

1620
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,040
can start playing around and creating

1621
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,480
some

1622
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,240
really cool recursive and generative art

1623
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,319
pieces that i think are fun to play

1624
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,280
around with and

1625
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:12,319
super super cool so yeah um

1626
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,440
thanks for joining me for class two of

1627
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,400
art and code and next week we're gonna

1628
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,799
jump even deeper into utilizing this

1629
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,000
like breathing

1630
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,760
sine motion for creating natural motion

1631
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,119
and then like i said before we're going

1632
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,720
to look into purlin noise which is a

1633
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,839
type of noise

1634
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,760
so it's randomness but it's a type of

1635
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,520
randomness that is meant to be

1636
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,440
more natural so we'll explore that

1637
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:43,920
inside of this motion graphics space
