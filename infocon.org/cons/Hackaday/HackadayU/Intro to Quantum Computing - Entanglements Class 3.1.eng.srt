00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,519
hello everybody

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,160
thanks for coming to the third quantum

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,960
computing session and hackaday

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,240
we do this every sunday this time for 30

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,800
minutes

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,279
today i know it's easter a lot of people

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,560
are off

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,039
but everyone's staying at home anyways

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,240
so

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,800
uh i hope this is fun so people wouldn't

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,119
consider this as work

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,480
the class today will talk about

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,000
entanglement but this is an overview of

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,440
what happens in this sunday classes

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,480
we have 30 minutes each day

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,440
talking about one topic and that topic

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,559
is based on

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,520
my comics of the week if you have

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,160
already

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,199
followed my project on hackaday or on

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,480
social media you

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
know that today we're going to talk

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,840
about entanglement

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,879
because this is the third class

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,159
we have already covered a few

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,240
basic concepts and if you miss them

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,799
don't worry there's the link to the

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,520
hackaday

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,799
project also brian has posted it

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,920
in the chat you can follow and find

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,840
the links to the recordings from before

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,280
in the files section and i also

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
include a couple links useful links that

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
you can look up

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,320
for self learning and we also gonna use

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,079
these later

38
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,840
did someone want to ask a question just

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,079
now

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,720
okay let's put questions in the chat and

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,280
i will

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
go through the materials on the slides

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,200
with you

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,759
uh remember that we talked about

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,320
superposition before

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,640
this is from last week we had

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,719
some examples showing we can

48
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,520
have different numbers of qubits and

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,000
then

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,200
that would determine how many

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,480
configurations we will have

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,080
so remember if we have one qubit

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,920
it can have two states in superposition

54
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,480
if we

55
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,840
have two qubits then we will have

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,000
four configurations in superposition

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,920
if we have three that would be eight so

58
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,879
n qubits will have 2 to the n possible

59
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,879
configurations it scales

60
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,760
exponentially

61
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,920
so that gives us a

62
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,840
degree of freedom to manipulate our

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,000
system

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,640
remember when we talked about

65
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,599
interference

66
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,800
last time when we have a

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,480
superposition enabled interference that

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,879
was

69
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,959
one of the strange things about quantum

70
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,159
mechanics

71
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,360
now because of superposition is

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,800
possible in quantum mechanics there's

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,239
yet another strange thing today

74
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,480
is entanglement so what is it

75
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,920
if we have a two qubit

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,599
system we would have four different

77
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,280
types of configurations that also means

78
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,959
that we could

79
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,440
have defined certain configurations to

80
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,760
be

81
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,200
in superposition so

82
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,319
there are two very interesting special

83
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,840
states that we can put the system in

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,360
if we have the

85
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,599
two qubits in the same

86
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,120
either zero or one we have this option

87
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,319
to have these two in superposition so

88
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,799
your first qubit could be zero second

89
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,319
cubit could be zero

90
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,760
or plus the superposition of

91
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,000
the first qubit being one and the second

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,360
cubit being one

93
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,799
so this is one possibility and another

94
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,238
possibility is that

95
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,720
they are different so first qubit and

96
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,440
second

97
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,720
qubit are opposite then you could have a

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,000
zero one plus one zero state

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
so it's basically this four but then

100
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,880
you can assign

101
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,880
b and c to be zero or a and b to be zero

102
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,639
so you get these two and why is it

103
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,000
special so look at this then if you want

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,400
to do an experiment

105
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,120
you just look at one qubit say the first

106
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
qubit if you measure it to be

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,320
zero then you don't have to do a

108
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,759
measurement of

109
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,199
the second qubit you already know your

110
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,320
second qubit would be zero

111
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,360
because each of this is

112
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,479
represented with a amplitude

113
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,720
we remember is squared is the

114
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,080
probability

115
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,880
if your first qubit is already zero you

116
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,080
know there's no

117
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,120
possibility that you will have this

118
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,600
configuration so you would know that

119
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,960
your second qubit is

120
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
must be zero you could do the same thing

121
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,520
with your second qubit you just measure

122
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,360
the second qubit you would know what

123
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
your first cubit would be

124
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,560
and in this case similarly if you have

125
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,120
you know

126
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,479
you have entangled set

127
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,680
then if you measure your qubit to be

128
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,240
zero

129
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,639
first one then you know your second one

130
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,080
will be one

131
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,440
and vice versa this is

132
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,520
called entanglement basically means the

133
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,280
qubits are correlated

134
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,680
when you do the measurements their

135
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
results will be correlated

136
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,000
and we have two special entangled

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,280
oh sorry four special entangled states

138
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,000
when you have two

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,080
qubits these are called the bowel states

140
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,280
it's showing you that so plus

141
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,560
or minus of the 0 1 and

142
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
1 0 combination or a plus

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,039
or minus zero zero one one so the

144
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,000
special

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,080
thing about it is that the amplitude

146
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,759
here now is equal

147
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,280
so it's equally likely to get um

148
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
the either outcome

149
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,360
so if you take these as an example

150
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
if your first qubit when you do the

151
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,120
measurement is zero

152
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,479
just pick pick one of the states

153
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,319
for example this one with a plus

154
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,520
then you know you would definitely get

155
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,599
a second qubit to be zero

156
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,880
with the probability of half and oh

157
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,280
and remember why do we have a square

158
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,919
root here

159
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,240
because of the normalization condition

160
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
we have to

161
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,039
make sure that all the probability add

162
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,520
up to

163
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,280
one so while you have

164
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,680
two super two states in superposition

165
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,120
that would be a square root of two

166
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,000
and if you measure your first qubit to

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,479
be

168
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,440
one then it's not possible to be this

169
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,840
one

170
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,960
it will be this one here so

171
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,280
your probability will be

172
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,960
half to get one one state out

173
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,280
so again this is

174
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,319
a repeat to say that if

175
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,440
you measure one qubit you would know the

176
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,680
other qubit without even looking at it

177
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,879
and mathematically what does

178
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,639
entanglement mean

179
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,240
we can write everything out nicely

180
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,840
into this vector which we introduced

181
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,599
in the first class so

182
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,599
remember that if we had two independent

183
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,960
qubits how you represent the system

184
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,800
is to do a tensor product so

185
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,479
these could be your two qubits and you

186
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,520
do a tensor product to write out

187
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,559
your resulted vector four by one vector

188
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,880
and that is to say if you have two

189
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,479
separate qubits and you put them

190
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,839
together

191
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,360
they could form a system

192
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,720
using a tensor product but if

193
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,959
you already have two qubits that's

194
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
entangled

195
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,200
it's impossible to break them apart into

196
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
two

197
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,880
independent qubits so if you try to

198
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,240
equate

199
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,440
this four by one qubit this is

200
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,480
uh the one of the bell states

201
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,200
and then equate it to a representation

202
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,160
this way

203
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,480
you will never get a solution

204
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,240
it is impossible to write this state

205
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,839
the bell state into a

206
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,120
individually separated two qubits

207
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,399
so that's how you can also test

208
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
if something is in entanglement is that

209
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,880
once they are entangled they cannot be

210
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,839
separated

211
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,920
into two independent cupids anymore

212
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,360
there is a very common mistake when

213
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,600
people talk about

214
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,399
entanglement it always sounds very

215
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,160
strange

216
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,680
when people say if we have cubits

217
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,959
entangled

218
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,360
you can separate them infinitely far

219
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,160
away

220
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
and if you change one of them the other

221
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,640
one would automatically

222
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,079
change that's not right that's not true

223
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,760
that cannot happen that would imply that

224
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
information can transfer

225
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,640
faster than light you have two

226
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,200
cubits infinitely far away and if this

227
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,680
one

228
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,839
changes and the other one immediately

229
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,320
feels the change and change itself

230
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,800
that's a information transfer that's

231
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,480
prohibited we know that

232
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,760
information cannot travel faster than

233
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,240
like

234
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,680
but so many people talked about this

235
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
when they mention entanglement so next

236
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,880
time if they

237
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,200
say this then you know that they don't

238
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,399
actually understand

239
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,440
quantum mechanics or quantum computing

240
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,800
so the picture of

241
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,600
measurement has the concept of

242
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,720
measurement has to be

243
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,959
in the picture or at least you know that

244
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,720
what entanglement

245
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,880
implies is a correlation between your

246
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,640
qubits

247
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,880
so

248
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,880
what happens is when you have two

249
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,160
entangled qubits

250
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,959
you if you poke this one i that's what i

251
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,920
was trying to show

252
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,519
is the other one doesn't feel anything

253
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,640
and if you separate them far apart

254
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,839
nothing is changing if because

255
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,959
the two cubits are still correlated

256
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,399
the correlation entanglement is not

257
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,760
a function of distance so

258
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,880
if you do a measurement of your qubits

259
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,600
infinitely

260
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,880
far away you would know the answer to

261
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,920
the other one

262
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,640
without looking at it that that's what

263
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,320
it is that's all it is

264
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,760
there's no spooky interaction as people

265
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,079
say

266
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,440
in popular science there's just no

267
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,760
interaction there if they are entangled

268
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,800
and separated

269
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,160
then nothing is changing

270
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,680
so we can use this to make

271
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,720
useful things you

272
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,320
if you can prepare a pair of

273
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,600
entangled qubits and separate them

274
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,279
to two different people one of them

275
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,279
if they take a measurement of their

276
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,399
qubit

277
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,720
they can know what the other person will

278
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,120
get when they make a measurement

279
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,320
so here alice and bob prepared

280
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,760
a pair of bell states they separated

281
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,560
them

282
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,839
and added if she measures and gets

283
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,360
zero she knows if bob measures he will

284
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
get a 1

285
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,760
because the state will be

286
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,120
in this one

287
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,399
now if she wants him to obtain 0

288
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,279
instead she will just ask him to flip

289
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,560
his cupid

290
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,880
and there are ways to flip cupid's which

291
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,839
we'll talk later

292
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,519
so this is basically

293
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,480
what entanglement implies is very very

294
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,720
useful we actually use it in every

295
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,600
single

296
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,320
algorithm

297
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,480
so this is repeating the idea there

298
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,000
you start with one of the entangled

299
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,440
pair alice makes a measurement

300
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,480
and she will know bob has a particular

301
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,920
one

302
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,839
and if bob measures his

303
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,120
he would know what alice has and if we

304
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,040
can entangle two cubits there's no

305
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,880
reason we cannot entangle

306
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,959
more more qubits so a bell state

307
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,800
counterpart for multiple qubits

308
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,800
is the gh set states

309
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,959
when you have three this is the simplest

310
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,440
form of g h flat states

311
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,880
is these one one one and zero zero zero

312
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,240
in superposition and if you have n

313
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,279
qubits you can just have

314
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,399
many many many of them and put them into

315
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,040
this

316
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,519
particular state to entangle them so

317
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,040
this is a shorthand

318
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,040
mathematical way to write this

319
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,760
you can imagine even though it cannot

320
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,440
communicate it cannot

321
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,680
be used to communicate information

322
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,360
faster than like it can still be

323
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,880
useful for example in encryption

324
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,680
you would know if you establish a key

325
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,839
using entangled qubits you know what the

326
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,760
other person will have

327
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,000
so you can encrypt your message and

328
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,279
decrypt your message

329
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,360
using a specific sequence

330
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,480
and some other examples also include

331
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,440
teleportation

332
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,760
this is one of the ways to demonstrate

333
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,399
uh if you have entanglement between your

334
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,760
qubits

335
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,320
but it also is a way of communication

336
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,959
so i just said that they cannot be used

337
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:03,760
to

338
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,320
communicate communicate faster than

339
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,199
light

340
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,519
so there needs to be some information

341
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,120
that's transferred

342
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,880
using classical ways of communicating

343
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,600
so i'm not showing you any details of

344
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
the

345
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,000
this algorithm yet i'm just using this

346
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,399
to tell a story with cartoon we'll go

347
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,079
into this

348
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,560
to see this step by step once we learn

349
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,800
how to manipulate cubits

350
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,759
so just look at this picture here what

351
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,079
is happening is when alice and bob they

352
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,560
pre-prepare

353
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,519
the bell state they separate them and

354
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,639
they go as far

355
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,920
away as they want

356
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,959
then alice now

357
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,000
has one cupid but if she wants bob to

358
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,800
know about

359
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,600
some unknown qubit that she later

360
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,639
obtains

361
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,680
she can actually entangle her now

362
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,560
two qubits and then she can do a

363
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,839
measurement of

364
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,000
her qubits and she finds out

365
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,279
the answer and call bob

366
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,279
not directly telling him what she has

367
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,279
but telling him what to do with his

368
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,399
cupid

369
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,720
when bob does the measurement he will

370
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,440
get

371
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,560
the same new qubit that alice

372
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,079
obtained using his only cubit

373
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,079
so that's what teleportation is about

374
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,519
it's basically because with

375
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,639
a starting point any of the ball states

376
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,839
you would be able to build out

377
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,120
a table or grid of what to do to bob's

378
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,199
qubit you know everything

379
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,720
in between in this grid and

380
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,240
you can just do a manipulation to bob's

381
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,759
qubit to obtain

382
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,360
what alice wants him to know we'll go

383
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,560
into this x

384
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,599
and z later these are gates that's

385
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,760
the way to apply a change to a qubit

386
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,119
so that would be our next few sessions

387
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,839
is about

388
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,439
how you can manipulate qubits

389
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,799
another similar algorithm

390
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,720
is the super dense coding it's kind of

391
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,119
the opposite so what just now

392
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,720
alice and bob did was they

393
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,480
exchanged classical information in order

394
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,760
to exchange quantum information so they

395
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,600
did not directly send qubits

396
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,679
they send classical information by

397
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,720
calling bob or

398
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,840
sending him a letter but in effect

399
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
bob gets the quantum information alice

400
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,840
wants him to know

401
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,679
super dense coding is kind of the

402
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,520
opposite where

403
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,679
they were sending quantum information

404
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,640
but what alice wants bobs to note is

405
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,760
a classical piece of information so

406
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,360
again you have to know

407
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,200
what type of gate you have to establish

408
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,280
a table of possible outcomes

409
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,559
when they prepare a

410
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,919
entangled pair alice

411
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,240
can then come up with a way to

412
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,400
let bob obtain her classical information

413
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,120
by sending him uh her

414
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,640
her cubit after she does a

415
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,559
manipulation on her qubit so

416
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,280
bob can obtain like classical

417
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
informations like zero zero

418
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,400
zero one one zero one one uh it

419
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,520
is cost super dense because they are

420
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,880
sending one qubit but then

421
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,679
it contains information of two classical

422
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,039
bits

423
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,520
so this is another place where

424
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,840
entanglement is used

425
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,120
so i'm just showing some of these

426
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,160
simple kind of toy models

427
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,520
to show that they are useful

428
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,200
if you can come up with clever

429
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,880
algorithms

430
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,840
and entanglement is used in every

431
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,760
algorithm we're going to talk about

432
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,200
and coming back to this multiple qubits

433
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,480
i just want people to absorb this here

434
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,679
if you have n

435
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,039
qubits you can entangle them all

436
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,160
and if n equals to 5 that would be

437
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,520
2 to the power of sorry if n equals to

438
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,400
500 that would be 2 to the power of 500

439
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,919
possible states your system could be in

440
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:52,559
that's

441
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,320
the total is more than the number of

442
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,880
atoms in the universe

443
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,160
yet only

444
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,080
500 qubits are needed to

445
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,280
contain all these information if you

446
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,200
entangle all of them

447
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,600
and that's what nature has been doing

448
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,559
that's

449
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,400
what our universe is having a lot of

450
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,600
fundamental quantum particles that are

451
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,200
in entanglement and they are just doing

452
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,679
this

453
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,200
calculation behind our back with

454
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,559
when we do a observation it

455
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,960
we use the term collapse last week but

456
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,000
it's really a

457
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,520
result of interference we are making

458
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,760
a observation to find out what's the

459
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,799
most possible

460
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,200
outcome but that at the same time all

461
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,280
these

462
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,640
particles are doing their own thing

463
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,240
without us looking so that's

464
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,799
really cool and then the last

465
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,080
piece is a word of caution here

466
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,360
is that entanglement can be can be

467
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,640
very useful if we know what we're doing

468
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,720
if we establish our organism that

469
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,760
we know each step what the qubits

470
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,360
would do then we will get the

471
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,679
results very efficiently if we do one

472
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,799
measurement

473
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,200
you will know what the rest of your

474
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,520
system will be at

475
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,360
but entanglement can be also very

476
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,200
dangerous

477
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
because your qubit your system has to be

478
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,480
perfectly isolated

479
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,559
if you prepare this very nice entangled

480
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,080
system you want them to be

481
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,799
totally uninterfered with your

482
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,840
environment

483
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,440
if there is any uh imperfection

484
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,240
it could very easily entangle with its

485
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,440
environment

486
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,559
and the environment is also made up of

487
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,760
all those quantum

488
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,120
particles so there's

489
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,280
you have to have prevention but then

490
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,480
measurement is an act

491
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,520
of destroying your

492
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,799
system so because

493
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,360
all of the measurement devices are made

494
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,480
of physical things

495
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,880
and they're all at the fundamental level

496
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,480
of quantum

497
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,720
then when you approach your system with

498
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,559
your measurement device

499
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,120
it would be entangled with your system

500
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
as well

501
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,000
so you have to build in this mess up

502
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,360
in your measurement in order to get

503
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
the correct information you need so

504
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,799
there's a huge

505
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,840
field about error correction when you do

506
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,440
measurement or you have unintended

507
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,559
errors when the cube is entangled with

508
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,559
its environment you have to be very very

509
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,600
careful

510
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,520
and have additional circuitry building

511
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,600
to correct the errors that could be

512
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,000
caused by the environment

513
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,120
so we will also talk a bit more about

514
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,520
this

515
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,720
in the hardware sessions because

516
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,840
different types of hardware will have a

517
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,120
different tendency

518
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,320
to is

519
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,760
entanglement with its environment

520
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:28,640
so that's what we're gonna show today
