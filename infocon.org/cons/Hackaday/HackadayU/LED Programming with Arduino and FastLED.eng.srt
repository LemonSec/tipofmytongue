hi

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,000
i'm mirabelle jones and i'm an

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,360
interactive artist working with new

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,320
technology

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,080
i'm also a software developer and

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,519
educator

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,760
and i'm kathy laughlin i'm a software

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,840
developer and interactive artist

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,600
and a senior exhibitions creative

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,039
engineer at meow wolf

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,119
where i create room scale interactive

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,320
installations

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,840
i'm excited to be partnering with

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,679
hackaday to bring you this class

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,320
on developing your own led animations

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,960
using tools like arduino and fast led

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,559
in this class students will make their

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,320
own beautiful lighting animations

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,320
using the onboard leds of the circuit

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,239
playground microcontroller

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,920
we'll also learn how to work with strips

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,840
and matrixes to create more complicated

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,960
lighting patterns

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,879
and we'll learn how to use sensors to

26
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,039
make our projects interactive

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,039
this course is suitable for beginners as

28
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,640
well as experienced developers and

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,840
makers

30
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,920
who are familiar with microcontroller

31
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
programming but want to learn more about

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,879
leds

33
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,559
we hope you'll join us for this exciting

34
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,080
course in led lighting

35
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,400
using arduino
