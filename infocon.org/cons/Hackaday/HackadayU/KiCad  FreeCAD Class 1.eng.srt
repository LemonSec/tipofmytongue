1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,010
hi my name is Luz Maria and thanks for

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,500
joining me on this first session on

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,080
introduction don't cry can't speak at

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,860
all the next four weeks to walk you

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,599
through the basics of these two programs

6
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:22,259
so once you're over the first initials

7
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:27,399
it becomes easier as you crept in so I

8
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,829
hope all of you help checked out the

9
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,309
hackaday road IO project page so here's

10
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:35,440
the entrance command my thought was to

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,270
use an eighty tiny 85 to drive a couple

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:46,270
of RGB LEDs uws on to peace I'm broken

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,090
up the sketch into four sections as a

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,680
controller which is the eighty tiny 85

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,470
you're going to use one pin as an output

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,820
that tries the RGB LEDs and we are

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,030
planning to use the second pin connected

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,189
to a switch which can act as a user

19
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:08,680
control of sorts next to the controller

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,610
we have the ws2812 LEDs but it's likely

21
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:19,720
that these LEDs external in output C pin

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,810
header we need a way to program be a de

23
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,240
tiny so that's our interface programming

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,060
and once we're done with programming we

25
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,340
can still use all of those pins that

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,140
have broken off and it is a pretty

27
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,070
simple and straightforward power supply

28
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,590
there's a few 2:03 two batteries in

29
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:44,080
series to give a 6 volts and you get us

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,320
a 5 volt that is located acquires you

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,970
know a 6 volt input and if I would have

32
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,280
put the cage will it making sugar which

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,640
using LTO which has the lowest possible

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,229
about voltage to pin header where we can

35
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,570
attach an external battery source so

36
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,360
that's essentially the plan so with that

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,790
let's get started

38
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,140
I can today the plan is to replicate the

39
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,480
engine schematic in packet to get all

40
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,049
the paths

41
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:17,109
wire it all put all the values and

42
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:18,860
references and so on

43
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,090
you look at how we can create custom

44
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,250
symbol library specific to this project

45
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,470
and how you can possibly edit and create

46
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,069
your own symbols or packet

47
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:36,560
and when you do is you already used it

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,030
earlier you might have an existing

49
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,569
project you want to start off with a new

50
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:44,689
project which you can do by a big file

51
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:46,969
menu or there is the new project icon

52
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:52,599
over here let's create one is my desktop

53
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,189
and we our new folder

54
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,099
I could eat you and putting that create

55
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,510
an insulator Paul

56
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,120
I can't and within here I'm going to

57
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:13,470
create a project tiny crystal blinky

58
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,550
and silver

59
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,160
once you do that calculate ps2

60
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,330
placeholder finds one plus two B and

61
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,430
this is what you see on the left side

62
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,520
indeed in the folder view I'm going from

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,100
left to right it is in progression of

64
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,990
how we would be using the different

65
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,560
programs the first icon is the key

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,720
scheme a schematic capture was edited

67
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,230
there is a simple editor then there is

68
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,020
the pcbnew which is the layout editor

69
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,170
and you shouldn't editor which you will

70
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,030
use to create your custom footprints

71
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,070
there is a built-in view through which

72
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,500
you can verify your design before you

73
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
send it out for fabrication if you'd

74
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,280
like to add custom logos to your project

75
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,490
there is a handy utility called pic map

76
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,880
component converter there is a bunch of

77
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,230
calculators available which lets you

78
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,420
calculate several things like this one

79
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,660
for example let's use of resistors if

80
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,738
you have an adjustable voltage regulator

81
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,170
there is a track with calculator there's

82
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,930
a transmission line leader and there's a

83
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:35,540
nice handy boat glasses table that's and

84
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,750
there's a custom designer design your

85
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,590
own page layout the other thing to do

86
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,810
before you get started is in preferences

87
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,620
depending on your past you have three

88
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,070
github repositories these symbols be

89
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,740
footprints and the same packages and you

90
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,750
need to cut up like it the location of

91
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,740
those directories over here so that's it

92
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,900
let's fire up a schema which is here and

93
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,460
you're presented with a blank slate

94
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,590
there are three toolbars

95
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,440
that you essentially use on the left a

96
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,900
couple of system parameters that you set

97
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,300
for example the first one I know shows

98
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,669
or hides the grid dots you need to

99
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,169
stretch the measurement units that

100
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,970
you'll be using with kinematically

101
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,760
literally is irrelevant use metric or

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,250
imperial you can have long or short

103
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,200
process rates you can

104
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,500
so hidden pins so that's the toolbar on

105
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,390
the left the top is the commonly used

106
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,980
tools and icons that you would find in

107
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,290
most programs it is pay to save files

108
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,660
there are a couple of zoom buttons you

109
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,530
can zoom in zoom out zoom window you can

110
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,430
redo and undo changes you can cut copy

111
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,970
paste important ones for us is an icon

112
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,439
which says edit page settings

113
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,290
if you want to

114
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,490
scroll and zoom in bracket your Colby

115
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,830
lumia mouse will zoom in and out like so

116
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,289
if you press the shift key and then use

117
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,479
the scroll button you will scroll when

118
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,599
the vertical Direction likes this and if

119
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,460
you use the control and the scroll wheel

120
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,250
you move in the horizontal direction

121
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,639
that's left and right so let's first set

122
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,750
the page settings click on the edit page

123
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,960
settings

124
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,789
icon and that brings you this dialogue

125
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,460
if you want to use the current state you

126
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,110
can push it to be issued it if your

127
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,380
design is going to have multiple layers

128
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,050
of hierarchy you can make sure that this

129
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,240
information gets exported all of those

130
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,889
sheets to

131
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,740
provision in this case version 1 so

132
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,830
let's put that in title you know the

133
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,150
projector is tiny

134
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,319
this poor blinky

135
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,990
company you can put whatever I put her

136
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,289
today

137
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,680
I meant that sample match

138
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,540
traduction to

139
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:25,500
kid and PK I can say okay zoom in over

140
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,380
here you can see that this information

141
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,690
has been updated of you at the dock we

142
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,540
also have a couple of other guy kept

143
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,200
specific pike ones and they have been

144
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,870
placed in the order in which you won't

145
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,830
use them while working on a project it

146
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,680
is a couple of points that refer to

147
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,990
libraries that the first one is to

148
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,540
create delete and edit genetic symbols

149
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,170
and this takes you to a symbol editor

150
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,100
Excel it is also a browser if you just

151
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,910
want to look at the various symbol is

152
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,190
similarly a food container so this is

153
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,880
for the PCB footprints and then there is

154
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,480
a schematic symbols icon

155
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,750
like it when you place any component on

156
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,120
the schematic it doesn't number it right

157
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,420
away so you can keep adding components

158
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,570
and they will all be without any

159
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,170
reference designations once you are done

160
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,159
with your whole layout then you can call

161
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,909
up the annotation with feature and

162
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:39,230
annotate the various component

163
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:43,070
there is a little jiggle which perform

164
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,320
some basic electrical rules like

165
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,470
checking if two power outputs have been

166
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,050
connected together or if you haven't any

167
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,970
unconnected pin left floating in your

168
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,330
schematic and it wants you about those

169
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,730
the next tool is the assign PCB French

170
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,130
systematic symbols again

171
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,370
usually when you place a symbol on

172
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,550
somatic kaika doesn't automatically

173
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,560
assign a footprint which with the

174
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,970
current version of package

175
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,280
rurals parts often come with their

176
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,590
footprints associated with in politics

177
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,420
but some of the common ones like a

178
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,360
resistor or a capacitor so things aren't

179
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,070
the same once you have done the

180
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,200
annotation once you the sign know the

181
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,660
footprints your schematic is pretty much

182
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,540
done and then you are ready to create a

183
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,030
netlist which is basically the glue that

184
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,130
connects schematic editor to the

185
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,670
physically ordered it is also a below

186
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,490
material generator which uses several

187
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,300
different scripts to generate fill

188
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,980
materials depending on what your

189
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,160
requirements are and we look at back

190
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,830
import later on and then finally on the

191
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,690
right side is the actual tools that

192
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,330
we'll be using to draw the schematic the

193
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,960
selection point to note at the top and

194
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,940
there is a highlighter next to it you

195
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,600
can play sports using this icon power

196
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,730
connections are chips a bit separately

197
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,470
in cricket and special libraries

198
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,000
connections you can then draw coils

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
using the draw bar or the place wire

200
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,880
come on you can also place buses and if

201
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,280
you using buses you need to have first

202
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,980
entries makes it you can combine

203
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,500
multiple buses and pick off a pass into

204
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,680
some buses if you have any pins that are

205
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,930
not connected for any of the symbols it

206
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,590
is essential to place no connection flag

207
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,920
over there so that the rules checker

208
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,760
doesn't

209
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,960
these junctions most of the time I carry

210
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,680
and place junctions automatically net

211
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,620
names on a tables this is a is extremely

212
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,900
handy all the connections that you make

213
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,050
in your circuit you should try and name

214
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,450
them as much as you can so let me just

215
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,970
use find where those connections are

216
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,040
going

217
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,560
that also allows you to have a

218
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,079
hierarchical layout for your skin.i

219
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,910
which means you can have a sheet and

220
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,920
then you can embed a sub sheet which has

221
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,870
some other section of portion of your

222
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,560
whole circuitry you can have a sheet and

223
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,050
then multiple sheets within that and so

224
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,050
on and there are two icons here that let

225
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,870
you navigate to your hierarchy there is

226
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,319
a navigator and a list of sheets that

227
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,509
you can choose so the next couple of

228
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,940
icons over here allow you to create a

229
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,470
spreadsheet

230
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,560
within this design and then finally

231
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,319
there is a couple of drawing tools and

232
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:49,290
you can add descriptive text on your

233
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,460
rescue Mary

234
00:11:51,460 --> 00:12:08,730
so with that quick internet started and

235
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,810
we start off with facing a needy tiny

236
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,380
that's gonna be her first action as far

237
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,290
as possible I will be using commands

238
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,450
that will be visible to you so click

239
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,490
like this so that you can see what

240
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,480
action ungli but most of these can also

241
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,339
be done using hotkeys for example

242
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:33,040
centered is X for this domain is s1 and

243
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,800
soumada left in spot and as you get

244
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,270
proficient with the program you will

245
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,850
find it much more efficient to start

246
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,490
using these hotkeys she would like to

247
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,740
have a look at all of the existing what

248
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,270
Keys you can do preferences

249
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,660
under preferences again

250
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,030
under what keys you will find a list of

251
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,060
all of the existing hotkeys so them are

252
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,520
pretty cells explained like in moves

253
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,030
particular item see copies it duplicates

254
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,510
it if you want to add a simple user the

255
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,880
expect a few hundred a power symbol you

256
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,330
read I use p alright so we good to go

257
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,970
with creating the schematic first thing

258
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,430
you're going to do is use this toolbar

259
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,770
icon called place symbol once you click

260
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,880
on it your cursor changes to a crosshair

261
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,760
with a pen you can bring that somewhere

262
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,320
within your sheet in the center let's

263
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
take like once it shows up the list of

264
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,670
all of the libraries that are installed

265
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,470
on your system so these are your

266
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,380
schematic symbol libraries and we're

267
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,810
looking for an 80 tiny so let's try and

268
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:45,230
use the search bar to look for it a tiny

269
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,230
but I don't find any and the reason is

270
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:55,529
if you look down here under MCU

271
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:59,279
microchip kinda does 80 mega and here

272
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,430
but no eighty tiny that's because I

273
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,120
haven't enabled that library and to

274
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,490
enable Christian libraries where you do

275
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,550
it is you go to preferences you click on

276
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,560
manage symbol libraries

277
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,079
but there are basically two types Doble

278
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:18,970
average that are available for any an

279
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,370
epic project that you open up a calendar

280
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,310
system and project specific libraries

281
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,459
that limited only to the current project

282
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:30,009
that you are working so as you can see I

283
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:34,540
have in this case let's go down and see

284
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,420
here it is eighty tiny it is unchanged

285
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,939
which is where I can't use it put a

286
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:42,459
checkmark and MgO microchip eighty tiny

287
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:46,689
and say okay and now if I click here

288
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,649
again to place apart and in the search

289
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:54,699
bar type Katy tiny I get a bunch of

290
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:58,269
eighty tiny still a long list I won't

291
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:02,110
use any tiny 85 let's make that list

292
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,410
shorter and there is six versions

293
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,910
available so this 85 - 20 a new PU and

294
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:16,240
Su and a Dustin mu P 1 s you the PU is 8

295
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,200
pin package which is what we want to use

296
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,380
I'm gonna click ok and it's still

297
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,480
floating you can move it around to where

298
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,070
you want to place it

299
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,350
and then you click at one final time and

300
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,760
it gets placed over it

301
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,529
so that's your eighty time the next

302
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:37,930
thing I need to add is a switch and a

303
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,310
sister to act as the input so I can just

304
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,160
click somewhere else it brings up the

305
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,720
library browser I need a switch so I can

306
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,120
just start searching for it as SW

307
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,829
shortened our list if you want to use a

308
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:00,490
push-button switch push and yeah the

309
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,399
first one I get is what I want to use

310
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,310
the push-button switch all right so

311
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,670
let's choose that is okay it's still

312
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,949
floating because I can move a turn-on

313
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:15,010
and I will introduce you to the new come

314
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,380
on here before you place it if you press

315
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,170
the are key you can rotate this

316
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,209
single-issue right click 'add you can

317
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:28,839
under orientation choose what

318
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:31,740
orientation in deeds to be

319
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,060
it's split cancel and rotate it once and

320
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,380
place it somewhere over here press shift

321
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,520
and scroll to spill down

322
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,360
the other thing you can notice this if I

323
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,209
click on this symbol and I place the

324
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,220
mouse cursor here and press the N key I

325
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,180
can now move it

326
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,370
at the bottom of your taskbar you will

327
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,860
notice the coordinate system there is an

328
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,339
absolute x and y which is capital X and

329
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,790
capital y and you will also notice

330
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,130
relative pH and ey ordinates but

331
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,170
relative can be useful for example it

332
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,750
said I want to place my switch at this

333
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:19,420
location which is X 6.5 and Y 1.7

334
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,390
I can't place it here and at this point

335
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,420
if I press the spacebar once you'll

336
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,910
notice the DX and dy accordionist become

337
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,650
zero which means these are relative

338
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,210
coordinates now with respect to the

339
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,300
center of the switch and this can be

340
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,670
handy because I can now

341
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:40,090
choose to place another single come down

342
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,650
here

343
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:47,380
click once search for a resistor despite

344
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,440
our and I got it first symbol which pops

345
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,720
up is the resistor symbol click OK now I

346
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,720
can place this such that it is oriented

347
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,420
in the right position with respect to

348
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,340
the switch

349
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,080
we need another resistor which acts as a

350
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,130
current limiter for the RGB LEDs now

351
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,900
since you already have a resistor we can

352
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,670
just grab this and place it somewhere

353
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,660
else you can do that using be Hindu

354
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,750
right-click and say to click it or you

355
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,660
can use the see what key see once you do

356
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,760
that and you move your mouse key you can

357
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,650
film place it somewhere else we need to

358
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,059
rotate this 90 degree rotate it once and

359
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,370
it needs to be in line with pin number

360
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,830
three just bring it here then you see

361
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,150
arrow keys to move it like so and place

362
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,929
it here so that's the resistor placed

363
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,730
over here we are pretty much done with

364
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,800
placing parts for this section so let's

365
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,059
wire it up by adding wires that is using

366
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:57,520
this icon pearl place while you click on

367
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,270
that once your personal being genius -

368
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,880
crosshair with a pen you start off with

369
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,510
pin number age of your eighty tiny

370
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,700
people up like so click once then bring

371
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,470
it to the switch Drexel

372
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:21,540
the other end of the switch resistor in

373
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,070
this resistor this pin has around hollow

374
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,650
circle that indicates that this is an

375
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,110
unconnected pin you can notice that on

376
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,170
all of the other pins pin number four is

377
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,940
unconnected once there is a valid

378
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,030
connection made to such a pin the circle

379
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,330
disappears like like on this pin of the

380
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,600
resistor I start with drawing my wire

381
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,280
from here click once

382
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,960
go down and click once who left and go

383
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,630
up to the same time until I reach this

384
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,870
point and then click once you noticed

385
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,700
that we who circled on both of these

386
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,040
pins have now disappeared which means we

387
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,360
have made a valid connection between

388
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,860
these two pins

389
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,230
it's also join up with the realistic on

390
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,299
this once

391
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:16,049
people here once nearby history as you

392
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,509
can see these two where as a post but it

393
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,429
hasn't put a junction over here it's

394
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,019
smart enough to know that you don't want

395
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:24,629
that connected we since this is going to

396
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:28,349
be going to be led which also need a

397
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:32,729
brown 5 volts we probably ought to bring

398
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:34,769
those wires here as well so we have a

399
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:35,729
nice Pippen

400
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:39,469
so we can start with

401
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,220
he'll kick once

402
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,220
or down like so

403
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,220
once

404
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,820
and

405
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,360
double-click over here

406
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,720
so that ends people drawing process and

407
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,030
you'll notice the wire now has a hollow

408
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,850
square here which again indicates that

409
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,760
this end of the wire is unconnected

410
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,740
let's draw a similar ground where we

411
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,600
start from this point

412
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,220
and they move up EXO

413
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,190
you

414
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,580
it's ended but we missed on one wire so

415
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,210
let's add that the input to from the

416
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,200
switch is number two a key confident to

417
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,760
once bring my wire here tip once it adds

418
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,010
a junction let's add netlabels now which

419
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,590
is done using this icon over your place

420
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,070
netlabels again the way it works is once

421
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,340
your name will be labels icon here

422
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,800
crosshair and a pin and you can then

423
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,100
select where you want to add the net

424
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,470
label so in this case let's add an a

425
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,560
table too

426
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,830
this way which is the input so I can

427
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,100
click on this meanwhile it brings up

428
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,530
dialog box where I can put labels so

429
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:12,530
this is switch in custom UI n you can

430
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,080
also control its orientation and then

431
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,450
you can also make it bold or italic

432
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,890
stands for click OK it's still not place

433
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,450
where you want it because you can still

434
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,860
really move it around

435
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,279
if I place it you'll notice it gets all

436
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,279
square over here which means this is an

437
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:34,559
unconnected label

438
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,230
and if I want to make sure that it is

439
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,019
that it should be I bring it and place

440
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:43,169
it on this wire over here once you do

441
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:46,080
that it gets connected to this fire and

442
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,519
these three wires now have a label on as

443
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,730
SW and a score I n so let's add a

444
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,210
similar label to the output so I choose

445
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,559
placed net label I place my cursor over

446
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,749
here on this fire and give it a name of

447
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:08,740
let's say LEDs

448
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,380
say okay

449
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,010
once

450
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,900
make sure that I see this

451
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,330
and now let's add into the remaining

452
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,440
netlabels place wire over here end it

453
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,300
over here by double-clicking it like so

454
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,690
then click on the net level iPhone place

455
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,210
it on this hollow green square over here

456
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:38,430
give it an X P in select okay and I can

457
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,890
still move it around so I can rotate it

458
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:45,180
place it over it but still got a way to

459
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:49,200
extend wires so if you right click on a

460
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,640
wire like so

461
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,770
use expose option which is right this

462
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,230
lets you

463
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,280
right

464
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,389
what aspects

465
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:06,279
expecting this other wire is will click

466
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:10,270
on G extended outbreaks though

467
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,510
and then let's add neatly with these two

468
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:18,260
wireless respect pick on base level

469
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,879
and misters finals

470
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,299
in place

471
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:29,320
I can copy a label right click and say

472
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,980
you

473
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,030
is to do here I can edit this by

474
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,310
pressing the e key or right click and

475
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,250
fill it

476
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,410
and change the name to GND it goes next

477
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,200
thing we need to do is add the power

478
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,680
information and they are accessed by I'm

479
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,510
new taking on the P alpha T or this icon

480
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,340
symbol over here which is placed the

481
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,100
power pot so let's bring the cursor here

482
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,310
where the VCC pin number 8 is click once

483
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,330
and you'll notice error just two

484
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,820
libraries here but mostly what you will

485
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,070
be using is the ones from power we will

486
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:17,290
just use five words plus Phi B as our

487
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,420
symbol click on OK

488
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,650
basic here then I need to add ground

489
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,730
symbol as well that will come here pick

490
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,170
away at once

491
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,780
brings up again the power libraries

492
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,140
click on our or in filter just look for

493
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,700
TNT and place it here

494
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,650
it makes it a better visual experience

495
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,300
if you don't have a wire connecting

496
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,270
every ground connection only of doing

497
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,279
that is I can right click on this

498
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:59,369
plastic material and say break the wire

499
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:04,270
right click on this

500
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,309
horizontal wire say delete this file and

501
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:12,910
I can delete this virus when I go to us

502
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:16,360
because I use the require function so we

503
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,360
have ground here we can just copy this

504
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,920
using C move quick ones to place it

505
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,760
both of these pin points are at the same

506
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,549
ground pitch then I can

507
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:35,239
add one over here is that I can click

508
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:39,639
here to copy no click here once to place

509
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,039
then I can delete this by pressing the

510
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,399
Delete key

511
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,970
so that completes the controller part

512
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:53,100
let's quickly and the LEDs and we can

513
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,560
put them in line over here and in order

514
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,260
to do that we might want to add some

515
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,210
space over here to add those components

516
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,570
which means moving this block towards

517
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,390
the left that's pretty simple as in most

518
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,780
of the problems you click once you draw

519
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,230
a block cover the whole area you want to

520
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,280
select click a second time and then

521
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,690
using the arrow keys or the mouse you

522
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,120
can just move it like so then click it

523
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,410
once and touch base all right so let's

524
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,290
go be LED spot now pity you know that

525
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:33,060
please let me please symbol icon we

526
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,830
bring it approximately where we want to

527
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,950
place it click it once and in our finder

528
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:45,780
look forward of years wait one is the

529
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:51,350
LED library has a ws2812 P and a zoom in

530
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,860
and I place it like so so that's one and

531
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,950
I need three of them I can either copy

532
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:04,620
and paste this or I can just click here

533
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,340
once and you'll see the first entry is

534
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,560
recently used so that has some of the

535
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,850
parts that you've been using here

536
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,610
already you can click on SS we want to

537
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,660
be pick on okay let me just bring it

538
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,290
here

539
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:23,440
and then christosp I once to make the

540
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,530
relative coordinates 0 and then use the

541
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,370
arrow keys to move it

542
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:33,940
1.3 inches along the x-axis it lines up

543
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,510
nicely

544
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,780
and then I can use the right-click here

545
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:45,149
if i duplicate place it at 2.6

546
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:48,839
that gives us our three piggies it makes

547
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:51,029
sense read and output keeping new

548
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,609
connector over here so we are still in

549
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:57,359
Lille is first option we can just split

550
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,219
your ones and you look for a connector

551
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:04,979
so seokhun should bring us a lot of

552
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:08,159
connectors which would be a three pin

553
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,309
sockets 1x 0 3 this is the one that

554
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:15,149
we're looking for bring it here and we

555
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:18,479
can place it like so please you want to

556
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:21,929
mirror this along the x axis you can

557
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:25,229
press X and you'll notice pins 1 and we

558
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:27,899
have now kiddo and if I press X again

559
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,429
the clip over again

560
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:32,190
if I press Y it will flip along the y

561
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,739
axis so the pins will be pointing on the

562
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:35,580
other direction

563
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,539
I press Y again comes back so we have

564
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,940
everything that is needed for the LEDs

565
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,799
let's fire it up quickly choose the

566
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,559
place wire come on let's touch from the

567
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,239
output pin over here click once row like

568
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:54,200
so click once

569
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:01,408
dragon going to kill ones

570
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:08,920
and then double-click then we join

571
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:15,720
each of the three entities for this one

572
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,740
and three

573
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,750
let's join the output

574
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:29,750
this pen

575
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,230
the input of this to the output of this

576
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,400
one input of this the output of this one

577
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,750
a strong piece of wire here and

578
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,750
dominated

579
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,750
and then let's draw the ground

580
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,270
connection so we start here

581
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,090
drawler on click points prolong your

582
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,990
clip once

583
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,070
in putting here to the end

584
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,178
akia ones

585
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,520
once enjoying the LEDs to this ground

586
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,970
where one

587
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,860
to

588
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,010
and

589
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,740
three

590
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:18,320
all that's left is to place net labels

591
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,850
over here we can easy you just join

592
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,620
these wires but since we're trying to

593
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,650
figure out how next labels will take in

594
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:29,120
this copy to it but now we want to

595
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,660
rotate this labels to press R twice and

596
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,179
place it here you know the mouse over DL

597
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:38,450
C to copy move it

598
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,860
nice to rotate

599
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,220
place it over here over over ground see

600
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,610
the copy

601
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,860
good boys and

602
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,460
that completes the LED part we'll save

603
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,280
this schematic now and we need a way to

604
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,070
program this each I look at hundreds

605
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,990
which you can see pin number five this

606
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,980
name out and secondary in pin number 6

607
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,780
is main and secondary out

608
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:16,040
number seven is clock and number one is

609
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,890
beset so let's add those labels over

610
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,310
here a couple of buyers first like I

611
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,020
said this is purely for aesthetic

612
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,510
reasons but you can add a label directly

613
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,260
to the pin as well so I am good at for

614
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,310
fire strikes

615
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,070
and then I'm going to add neatly with

616
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,040
the piece or worse so you use the place

617
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,060
in a table

618
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:45,280
people who hear once and this one is

619
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,030
inside to point deliver on suppress are

620
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,630
twice to get here

621
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:59,040
the next one is is open smart learn how

622
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,020
to press the Alt key twice I'm going to

623
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,770
select orientational is left okay liquid

624
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:10,290
away next one is clock testicle and

625
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,050
orientation space left so things become

626
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,880
faster now lastly the pin number one is

627
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,740
we said rst

628
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:26,289
save it we have everything labeled I see

629
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:28,870
the next thing to add is the programming

630
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:36,250
header is 16 to go male header and

631
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,350
people to use the place opponent icon

632
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:46,840
here it is 2 columns and 3 rows

633
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,940
or even this is what you want this is

634
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:55,030
obviously in HD number this click okay

635
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,200
to cure once the story was your pity and

636
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,010
then place netlabels presume in but to

637
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,300
now select a spire

638
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:12,870
profile once and double click here to

639
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:16,310
end it so they'll process key

640
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:20,179
let's look at copy and paste now I can

641
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,359
so a block here like this and say

642
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,569
duplicate bring it to OPM and paste same

643
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:32,340
thing right click

644
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,589
extra

645
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:39,010
you click it face it on pin number

646
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,840
I can grab all of these be right

647
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:47,389
release key right

648
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:50,989
you keep it this stop and place it over

649
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:51,440
here

650
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,440
let's place netlabels open number two is

651
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,280
you should be if I won't

652
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,210
this is five words you can also copy

653
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,190
labels from somewhere else in this room

654
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,480
the most

655
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,050
yes Brown became and click once to place

656
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,280
it over here

657
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,690
and between my wooden club is a main out

658
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,380
second week in so mosa let's go to know

659
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:24,060
I say you see the puppy shifts through

660
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,600
to move

661
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,809
is

662
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,089
let's bhatia the others is also based on

663
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:37,690
Surya C for copy shifts prune

664
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,040
you want to rotate it

665
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,430
and place it on pin number 1 x1 is clock

666
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:54,540
ACK we are also nasty a copy shifts roll

667
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:00,220
okay twice they secure then there's when

668
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,680
you reset so happy

669
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,960
rotate

670
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,230
yes so that's a program header and let's

671
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,990
save it now if you'll notice each part

672
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,340
has two important pieces of its mission

673
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,980
visible one is its reference designator

674
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,950
which right now has a question mark for

675
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,540
all of the parts and these are the

676
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,870
values this one is the 80 tiny 85 - PDP

677
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,480
you this one doesn't have a value here

678
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,790
it is just called our this one as it is

679
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:38,320
for our annotation - I don't use the

680
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,210
schematic symbols once you do that it

681
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,920
brings up a dialog box where there are

682
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,230
several options there is really nothing

683
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,840
much to be done in this box except

684
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,780
select candidate so you can play around

685
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,850
with the different sort position and see

686
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:56,500
how things change but as of now this

687
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,660
would help II numbered some of the value

688
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,450
not yet set so we will have to do that

689
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,330
for example this resistor is going to be

690
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,070
a pinky again there are many different

691
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,070
ways of editing this the fastest way is

692
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:15,990
to go your mouse over the value and

693
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:19,390
double-click that brings up the label

694
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,580
properties the other way is to right

695
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,850
click somewhere on the symbol and under

696
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,609
properties select

697
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:31,059
edit the value unless like this whisper

698
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:35,390
and the text is

699
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:39,200
and click OK

700
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,280
this resistor is right click and edit

701
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,450
value' say v0e

702
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:51,230
for ohms the other thing I want to name

703
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:56,619
is this connector click on e in it and

704
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:59,680
be out put it out

705
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,609
so that's my output connector let me

706
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:09,290
also rename the program header to I can

707
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,109
pull my mouse over this text and click

708
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:15,980
on the B key or anywhere on this

709
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,940
component and press B xx the value back

710
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,680
so let's follow it

711
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,380
SPI here which program

712
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,460
and the switch making us rename it value

713
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,420
yes keep it short

714
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,110
let's save it

715
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,320
let's look at how to end of make things

716
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,110
a bit easier to read in the schematic by

717
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,750
moving things around so I can hold my

718
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,580
mouse on this piece of text where you

719
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,310
click on em to move it and you can see

720
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,930
where the Anchor Point which is the

721
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,960
center of this I see so I want to let us

722
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,790
say rotate it and keep it along the left

723
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,590
edge I will press R to rotate

724
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,990
bring it where I need to place it and

725
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,780
click it once and that's how you move

726
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,450
that piece of tape over my mouth were

727
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:13,650
you one press em to move it way to a

728
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,150
location it once in leave it

729
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,490
same thing with the resistors remove the

730
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:23,390
values references inside the rectangle

731
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,799
so Oh mom has all the reference kick em

732
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:32,240
ones rotate ones and place it here in

733
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:38,640
the center and take the value em so

734
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,680
and then click to place them so that's

735
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,089
making it slightly more legible and

736
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:47,760
readable when you printed out of the PDS

737
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,250
written at this point let me save it

738
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,099
again and then let's figure out how we

739
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,519
can add a bus but before I do that

740
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,650
because I want to add the bus to these

741
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,660
pins and connect that bus with this

742
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,099
program header

743
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:05,309
let me make some space over here to draw

744
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:08,700
those wires and in order to do that I

745
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:14,010
click once a rectangle like the pivot

746
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:18,210
and I can right click and do drag look

747
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,640
and then you see arrow keys too

748
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,890
without practice

749
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,809
notice that

750
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:32,719
we ended up with two issues here it it

751
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,939
tracked these two wires as well but

752
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:39,980
that's an easy fix I can grab this

753
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:45,740
and bring it here acumen grab this bring

754
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,320
it you all right so we have enough space

755
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,770
here to draw maybe bus entry points in

756
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,660
then we can figure out how it connects

757
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,500
over here so buses you first had where

758
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,869
the entry points which is this icon over

759
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:02,510
here please wire to bar centric so you

760
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,630
will you're connecting a wire to a bunch

761
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,960
of otherwise known as a bus you can at

762
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,640
once

763
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,260
it's moved over here

764
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,810
and look at the end of the square once

765
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:20,400
that places this first entry here if the

766
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,680
orientation isn't right you can go your

767
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,950
mouse over this person tree right-click

768
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,910
and say change the shape which kind of

769
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,570
mirrors it

770
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,150
and now to make things easy we can just

771
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:39,359
right click and duplicate it again to a

772
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,000
block right click

773
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,940
duplicate people

774
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,330
then

775
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,310
we did one more time for a for plan

776
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,160
right click

777
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,350
duplicate

778
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,250
Rep - but it's okay I can take one and

779
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,100
delete this one and then I'll need to

780
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,680
change the orientation right-click first

781
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,250
where entry set this and we actually

782
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,470
have two of them over here create the

783
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:14,670
other one so we have these person trees

784
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:18,760
here let's add person trees

785
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,010
to these 16 dispels I pick on me wire 2%

786
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,760
you icon here

787
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,730
once

788
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:36,499
here once here once

789
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:43,910
okay once once once so in orientation

790
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:47,660
that have no tried again

791
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:53,380
directly change the shape right click

792
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,500
insufficiently

793
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,730
change the shape for these are Indus

794
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:02,740
right-click and move it thanks

795
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:10,630
right click click move place so we have

796
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:15,570
these entries Yona six over here

797
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,050
IKEA for over here you don't need and

798
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,340
the two for the power

799
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:25,119
let's get those two don't need this

800
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,690
and it's just going to connect these

801
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,960
four words from this connector to be

802
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,769
sport wires on dat tiny and we have the

803
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:38,470
bus increase prepared next step is to

804
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,720
click on this icon which says place a

805
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,189
bus and

806
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,789
from here

807
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:48,939
and

808
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,520
check your once

809
00:43:56,859 --> 00:43:59,289
once you come home here and click it you

810
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:01,209
can press the Enter key on your keyboard

811
00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:05,259
who in the bus you'll notice that the

812
00:44:05,259 --> 00:44:07,269
circle at the end of this person to you

813
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,120
has disappeared

814
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,370
we circle at the end of these

815
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:15,270
percentages of disappeared but not over

816
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:17,250
here so we learned we had a bus

817
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,490
connection from here to this bus using

818
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,320
the same tool starts from here

819
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,600
and in the end it over here and it added

820
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,120
a bus to bus junction a wheel so now

821
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,200
what God has done is take these four

822
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,280
wires from here and pipe it to a single

823
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,310
common bus and then spread it out with

824
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,160
this program pin network and if you were

825
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,530
pretty complicated sheet radio working

826
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:48,470
on and your lots of buses you can use

827
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:52,190
this tool to make your kinetic easier to

828
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:57,080
to be save it so that was description of

829
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:02,050
our buses automatic hierarchal seats

830
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:05,120
there is a certain method to the madness

831
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,600
over here so let me try and see if I can

832
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,180
make it as simple as possible so first

833
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,430
step is to create a higher arch pushy

834
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:16,340
choose their icon

835
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,560
click somewhere on your sheet once and

836
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,290
you'll notice a block offset you can now

837
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,050
change specialist eyes something like

838
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,860
this is good enough it's important to be

839
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,540
reasonably descriptive name rather than

840
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,960
the time stamp based name that it

841
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,490
selects for you so let's call this the

842
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:41,950
power supply all right what is it and

843
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:47,859
give the same name to the sheet

844
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,490
the sign name and a sheet name can be

845
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,320
different but is usually best for keep

846
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:57,180
them both the same click OK and your

847
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,210
Eyre article sheet is now placed over

848
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:03,780
here if you look at navigate schematic

849
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,290
hierarchy you will need navigator that

850
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,450
will list all of the sheets that you

851
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,060
have in your current canary and you can

852
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,980
click on one of those and enter that

853
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,740
sheet the other one is

854
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,839
this icon to leave a sheet or interest

855
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,750
as with every command in fact I've got

856
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,339
several pieces of doing the same things

857
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:27,339
I can hold my mouse inside of this block

858
00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:30,160
right click once and click on enter

859
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,400
'sheet but the faster way of doing that

860
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,650
is also by just double-clicking over

861
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:39,820
here next oh and we have a fresh blank

862
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,190
sheet here is used to look at the file

863
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,930
name it says power supply

864
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,530
rocketskates power supply pass over here

865
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,660
and then connected to the sheet at the

866
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,510
top which you can see is the route

867
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:57,910
so as usual we choose the place simple

868
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:00,380
click once bring it somewhere between

869
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,280
your sheet click once the library is

870
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,260
open search for

871
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,200
battery let's choose this because we are

872
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,880
going to be using two batteries in

873
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,160
series this is a good representation of

874
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,640
that click on OK

875
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,220
zoom in a bit and first here thank so

876
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,579
that's your battery

877
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:27,880
exponent vinegar is polarized capacitors

878
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,349
let's look at typing C brings us if you

879
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:36,549
look at this symbol CP is the polarised

880
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:38,310
capacitor

881
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,480
let's like that

882
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:50,690
we're here press C and select PE

883
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:55,339
unpolarized version and place fit here

884
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,870
let's place one connector over here

885
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,720
a bit too pain

886
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,730
let's rotate it so it faces the right

887
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:11,740
direction let's flip it along me

888
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:15,490
it's successful number one is akuto then

889
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,700
place it here so most of the bus here

890
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,240
except for the ideal occurrence he

891
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,980
looked for LD oh and we have quite a lot

892
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,860
of choices over here there is a part

893
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:36,280
number that is useful only triple one-77

894
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,360
this this one looks like a good choice

895
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,950
ap triple one 7 - 5 0 and let's use a

896
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,980
surface mount device footprints what is

897
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,550
good practice to in terms of placement

898
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:55,650
and routing click on OK

899
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,920
place it here

900
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,880
give all the parts that he for the post

901
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,690
planner

902
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,770
we completely then choose misfire and

903
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,480
start drawing our connection we start

904
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,440
with the input connector

905
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,920
and connected to a input on the voltage

906
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,310
regulator

907
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,250
connect the output to the capacitor the

908
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,710
other end to the capacitor two turns

909
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:30,400
back to the input header the batteries

910
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,540
so

911
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,920
is that you

912
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,040
at this one net brand

913
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:49,340
- pin 1 so that's power supply let's

914
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:54,140
quickly name unemployed values for the

915
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:59,380
components of this one is call it B in

916
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,820
input voltage

917
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,369
there were sleepin battery and pull it

918
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:10,609
TR 20 32 times two

919
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:14,290
the polarised capacitor I developed on

920
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:19,570
CP and put a value let 470 I prefer 25

921
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,230
volts

922
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:29,050
so okay output filter can be 100

923
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:35,280
you can okay and of the pots values now

924
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,260
we need to annotate this section now

925
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,630
let's click on the energy like one

926
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:47,269
click on annotate close and we are these

927
00:50:47,269 --> 00:50:50,220
butts number

928
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,280
so here's the second sheet and if I

929
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,000
directly cure and say leave she I go

930
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,450
back to my route sheet and now the trick

931
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,690
is how do you make those connections

932
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:07,240
between the power supply

933
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,509
to

934
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,610
Bloodshy

935
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,690
in order to do that we enter a subject

936
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:18,760
purse that I will click on horseplay

937
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,510
a zoom in a bit so you want to connect a

938
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:26,020
hierarchal able to or net label let me

939
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,859
show you how this works I click on

940
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:31,500
original label

941
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:36,590
and I can just visit any that to kill us

942
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,140
there are three connections going

943
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,210
between this street and the route that's

944
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:46,220
a to be in which is the input voltage

945
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,780
the other one is the output voltage

946
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,510
which is 5 volts and third one is ground

947
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,299
those are the three things that I need

948
00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:56,460
to get wrong in fact I don't even need

949
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,750
to be in because it's only limited to

950
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,839
this sheet it doesn't go anywhere else

951
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:06,150
in the circuit except over here so I can

952
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:10,650
ignore being as the herati but the 5

953
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:13,880
volt and the ground needs to be

954
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,849
connected to the external would choose

955
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:19,380
energy label

956
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:26,610
the cure once and all the spy words it's

957
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,850
an output because it's going from here

958
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:33,150
as the power supply to the rest of the

959
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,880
circuit and

960
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,080
click on okay

961
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,170
I'm going to rotate it and I'm clicking

962
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,630
it here wants to place it like so so

963
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:47,830
that's my first iron label gonna create

964
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:51,310
a second one here over brown click here

965
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:55,090
once people it does GND that's also an

966
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:58,870
output rotate it place it here now I can

967
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,780
either just connect to the 5 volt and

968
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:04,750
ground over here or we can just add

969
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:08,020
little stubs of wire over here like so 1

970
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:14,430
& 2 then use net name

971
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:18,760
you care once all this I won't

972
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:25,240
and the other one G&E basica you still

973
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,630
missed out on adding net levels to these

974
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:31,390
buyers let's quickly do that I just will

975
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:35,260
just copy this 5-wood and

976
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:39,800
they secure copy this ground

977
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,970
and place it here but the VL needs the

978
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,940
fresh neck label gonna flip on this

979
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,370
net-lib you like one click here once and

980
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:52,960
call it be

981
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:56,220
rotate it twice keep it here

982
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:01,190
so that makes this pretty much complete

983
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:03,869
we are so next-gen left to be done on

984
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:06,890
the route sheet let's exit this sheet

985
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:09,329
and you can see it this one is still

986
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,339
blank empty there's really nothing we

987
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:14,339
get up but those two hierarchical labels

988
00:54:14,339 --> 00:54:16,200
that we added we need to bring it out

989
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,090
over here

990
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,910
the way it works is you can write it

991
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:23,430
over here or there is a tool here that

992
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,010
does the same thing for you which says

993
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:29,120
please and I've been imported from the

994
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,470
corresponding hierarchically so right

995
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:35,160
click here it says import sheet pens you

996
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,650
can at once you'll notice it's brought

997
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,980
this by won't be below for a selector

998
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,880
she did once here so it gets placed

999
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,579
right click once more you can import

1000
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:50,519
shipments and you get the second one

1001
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:54,730
which is ground you place it over here

1002
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,500
repeating the process until you reach

1003
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,650
this point where it says no new

1004
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:03,380
heritable

1005
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,810
at this point what's left is let me

1006
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,260
click on the baseball record throw a

1007
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,660
shortstop like so

1008
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:16,299
a second step like so remember to place

1009
00:55:16,299 --> 00:55:19,119
net label

1010
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,589
you kill ants pick five ones

1011
00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:27,369
rotate it so it lines up like so here

1012
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:32,740
the one sequence of GND inter

1013
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,550
rotate twice click and please

1014
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:41,170
so that places is the net labels on

1015
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:44,380
these corresponding parity labels that

1016
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,090
finishes the whole process of drawing a

1017
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,760
higher exposure and at this point I

1018
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,710
think we have pretty much done the a

1019
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,500
complete circuit we can run the

1020
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,660
electrical rules check now to see if

1021
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:58,930
there are any errors that it detects and

1022
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:01,630
throws up so click on this a t-bird icon

1023
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:04,720
or performing a little pulse check that

1024
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,330
brings up a dialog there are several

1025
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,790
options but the default ones the ones

1026
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:12,340
that work the best so let me go back to

1027
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:16,590
ESD and then click on run

1028
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,650
there and you'll notice it's one of two

1029
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:25,250
errors let's wait for them it says our

1030
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,340
pain is connected to another pin but is

1031
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:31,730
not driven by any pin now seems a bit

1032
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,950
put but what's happening is something

1033
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:38,180
that I can describe visually let's close

1034
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:41,540
this if I click on this hyperlink a few

1035
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,580
where the error is then let me close

1036
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,280
this so here's the error these two green

1037
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,000
arrows that you see what it means is

1038
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,130
this one is a wattage regulator and if

1039
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:56,170
you look at this symbol let's open the

1040
00:56:56,170 --> 00:57:01,150
symbol library which is

1041
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:05,230
it still will be

1042
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,810
first icon lets you search for its one

1043
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:09,910
constable

1044
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:15,859
and we use the AP triple 1 7 click ok so

1045
00:57:15,859 --> 00:57:19,160
this is the symbol that we use you'll

1046
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,040
notice that the three pins our input

1047
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,570
Oh Vivian

1048
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:28,450
in words for ground and power output for

1049
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:32,070
people which is as they should be

1050
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:34,590
which means a vegan is expecting a power

1051
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:37,680
input coming from some source there has

1052
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,980
to be a source that has a power output

1053
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,550
pin that is feeding this as a power

1054
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:49,140
input but if we look at a battery symbol

1055
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,890
for exam

1056
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,350
this is the one we use you notice a

1057
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,480
booth the pins of the battery facets

1058
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,700
which means you're not really power

1059
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,920
output pins at all

1060
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,619
and if we look at our connector couple

1061
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:09,430
then we had a hidden socket they are

1062
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:12,490
also passive pins

1063
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:16,510
so what it effectively means is this one

1064
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:20,470
is an input a power input pin which is

1065
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:23,080
expecting to be supplied with juice from

1066
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,890
an external source but everything that's

1067
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:29,020
connected to this pin the capacitor the

1068
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:32,140
battery and this two pin header don't

1069
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,390
have any power output pin on the barrel

1070
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:38,020
passer principle it's it's not able to

1071
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:42,430
be concerned to that error and the same

1072
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,609
thing with the ground pin is but there

1073
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:48,040
are two ways of resolving this one has

1074
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,280
to make the pins on this battery symbol

1075
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,970
as power outputs but other preferred way

1076
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:58,720
in racket is to add a flag here which

1077
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,060
tells the circuit that this particular

1078
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:06,099
net is a powered net and we do that

1079
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:08,890
using the power symbol its batteries

1080
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:12,550
pick on the base power put it click here

1081
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:16,660
once and what we're looking for is the

1082
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,900
flag that's flag and you'll get this

1083
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,570
symbol called

1084
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:24,110
pwf flag

1085
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:27,700
select that click on okay

1086
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,400
place it on this wire anywhere let's

1087
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,540
place it at this Junction

1088
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,920
and let's repeat that please one more

1089
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,790
power plants

1090
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:44,610
on the ground so we picker ones recently

1091
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:49,340
use power flag okay

1092
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,940
or twice to rotate it place it here and

1093
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,670
we have these two objects

1094
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:57,640
now what has happened is the power flag

1095
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:02,230
has a pin which is a power output which

1096
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:04,269
means when you connect it here this

1097
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:07,990
becomes a powered net and the same thing

1098
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:11,580
with the dummy in

1099
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:15,190
and now it's be on the est

1100
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:18,099
even order that finishes speedy check

1101
01:00:18,099 --> 01:00:21,760
and he analyst peers up she closed this

1102
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,619
you'll notice the green markers from

1103
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:25,620
Europe

1104
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:28,290
that's how the whole schematic capture

1105
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:31,860
process works I have pretty much covered

1106
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,590
almost everything there is to it except

1107
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:37,830
the custom library parts let's look at

1108
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:41,460
how that works first of all let's see

1109
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,400
what I can pass by default here's our

1110
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,000
schematic and if I open the folder where

1111
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,390
we have

1112
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:53,600
created this project which is here my

1113
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,410
desktop there is also a library file

1114
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:01,310
which is a cache that contains all the

1115
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:03,680
symbols that you used for these

1116
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,710
schematics and that can be a useful

1117
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:10,160
thing to add to your project so what

1118
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,480
we're going to do is

1119
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,080
under preferences - symbol libraries and

1120
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,280
the project-specific libraries I will

1121
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,440
click on the add existing library -

1122
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,740
table

1123
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:28,330
and I can slip this cash library and

1124
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:34,460
clip on open so that makes it listed out

1125
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,200
over here under a project specific

1126
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,220
library and click on OK

1127
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,619
and that's one way of making sure that

1128
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:48,230
your project always opens up with using

1129
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:51,109
symbols from the cache memory so the

1130
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:52,940
best way is to actually grab all of

1131
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:56,080
these symbols and dump them in your

1132
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,180
personal library let me see if I can

1133
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,270
quickly show you the easiest way to -

1134
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:06,520
the space open the symbol editor

1135
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:14,030
which good and the sing-off I created a

1136
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:18,530
new library which I call tiny under

1137
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:21,700
spoon clinking

1138
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,950
and save it

1139
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:28,609
as a project library not a global one to

1140
01:02:28,609 --> 01:02:33,140
cook it scroll down you should see both

1141
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,900
of those libraries listed out here so

1142
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,869
they start by dumping all of these pots

1143
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:44,000
into tangibility library I can open up a

1144
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,400
symbol that I used also notice that

1145
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,040
multiple symbols have appeared for one

1146
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,260
part that we use we use only the AP

1147
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:57,530
triple 1/7 but their sustain alias for a

1148
01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:00,260
lot of other three pin regulators which

1149
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:03,050
have the same symbol so all of them have

1150
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,810
ended up here you don't have to copy and

1151
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:08,480
paste all of them let's select this one

1152
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,250
the triple one 7-5

1153
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:15,410
and save it as

1154
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:20,359
this library I am popping it from the

1155
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:22,220
cash library to the maintainability

1156
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:25,520
library and saving it and it brings all

1157
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,640
of those aliases into my tiny blinky

1158
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,840
library so that's the oldest wrigley

1159
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,200
same thing with the 80 tiny I can just

1160
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,210
let any one of them but let's select

1161
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:43,210
8520

1162
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,290
file save as select tiny blinky still

1163
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:53,430
and then that brings all of the 80 tiny

1164
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:58,399
symbols into my tiny blinky library

1165
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:03,910
connector now here's where things get a

1166
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:08,530
little bit odd the cache library when it

1167
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:12,340
sails a component or a symbol adds the

1168
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:17,080
name of the library in front of the name

1169
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,350
of the symbol from that library and

1170
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:22,930
that's sensible but when we save it

1171
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:25,070
locally

1172
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,350
project library we don't want to have a

1173
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:29,360
library name you just want in be a

1174
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,720
symbol person

1175
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:35,579
so I'm going to edit this name by

1176
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:38,650
double-clicking on it and deleting this

1177
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:40,600
net

1178
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:46,060
sleeping okay then say save it as tiny

1179
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:49,460
blinky stay

1180
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,849
and that brings this connector over here

1181
01:04:51,849 --> 01:04:55,400
from the cash-strapped I can keep

1182
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,359
repeating that

1183
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,490
process and then finally the push-button

1184
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:06,290
switch select the switch file save as

1185
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:09,620
push it to the new library instrument

1186
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:12,720
double-click the name I did the name to

1187
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,840
remove reference to the library click OK

1188
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:20,660
and save file

1189
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:25,370
but let's see what the cache where it

1190
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:29,990
was before changes and then right-click

1191
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:34,870
on this library to save it

1192
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:39,500
and as a final step we can now make sure

1193
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,510
that all of the paths within this

1194
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:45,260
mattock used fresh library that we

1195
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:47,390
created which is a project library

1196
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:50,420
instead of the Doble library this handy

1197
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:52,310
tool that lets you do that give our

1198
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:57,080
tools and a built libraries single

1199
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,040
references

1200
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:02,070
or in der allows you to do is take an

1201
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:05,250
existing component which is a symbol on

1202
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:08,670
an existing battery and replace it with

1203
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:11,490
a symbol from the new library so it's

1204
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:13,190
already filled out the current library

1205
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:16,380
column and then the new library is the

1206
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,140
ones that I need to now add a

1207
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,460
double-click here

1208
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:25,589
open the library browser

1209
01:06:26,189 --> 01:06:29,300
finding blinky of the cash

1210
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:33,940
and choose the 1x2 socket

1211
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:36,130
double-click on that so it's going to

1212
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,830
replace from the connector library and

1213
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:40,810
replace it with the same man from the

1214
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,990
tiny meter then will be this process for

1215
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:46,330
all of these parts one by one it's a bit

1216
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:50,260
early we can leave the power single just

1217
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:54,640
so once I have made the table I can if

1218
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,900
you can apply you can okay

1219
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:01,230
sale and if I look at any of these

1220
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:04,620
symbols if I press E to edit right-click

1221
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:09,510
properties properties you notice the

1222
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:12,300
library reference is now tiny blinky so

1223
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,250
all of these symbols are now being

1224
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:17,640
Duff's on my local library this also

1225
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,730
allows us to actually modify our symbols

1226
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:23,540
so let's look at that example this one

1227
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:27,630
switch the library browser so let's go

1228
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:31,730
to the creating deleting editing symbols

1229
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:37,000
which opens up this hold on

1230
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,040
to our library

1231
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:44,300
and let's take peace which is an example

1232
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,770
double-click on this

1233
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:49,020
say we want to change this symbol with

1234
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:54,360
something more fancy I can delete these

1235
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:59,160
two clients and on the Left I have a

1236
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,600
couple new drawing tools that I can

1237
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,050
place fresh spins fresh text at Poly

1238
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:08,750
Pomona's the pros are let me choose the

1239
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,410
graphic rectangles

1240
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:13,589
and

1241
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:18,739
click once drag

1242
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,979
and click another time and I get a

1243
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:23,799
spokes here instead of a single line as

1244
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:29,080
value and will be what you can learn and

1245
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,469
I can just select that polygon icon

1246
01:08:32,469 --> 01:08:38,069
the cure ones that we cure close it

1247
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,399
now if you have founded entities like a

1248
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:45,040
circle or a rectangle like this you can

1249
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,800
double click on the edge to bring up a

1250
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,450
couple of properties one is the line

1251
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:53,560
width so we can change language to miss

1252
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,480
to 10 or 20 in this case

1253
01:08:58,189 --> 01:09:01,640
and you can fill with the outline

1254
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,569
villain which is read in this case or I

1255
01:09:05,569 --> 01:09:07,670
can change it to a background color

1256
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:11,620
which will make it light shade of yellow

1257
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,509
let's make it a solid red background

1258
01:09:14,509 --> 01:09:16,549
I can even add in arrow here by

1259
01:09:16,549 --> 01:09:19,460
selecting the polygon tool clicking here

1260
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:25,600
once on two three

1261
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,319
dougies meaning a triangle I can double

1262
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:32,779
click on the edge of the triangle and

1263
01:09:32,779 --> 01:09:35,920
fill it with

1264
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:42,899
let's just say this let's say does it

1265
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:45,658
even is that a new symbol is reflected

1266
01:09:45,658 --> 01:09:49,408
over here so I'll leave it to you to try

1267
01:09:49,408 --> 01:09:50,939
that out if you have questions on that

1268
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:54,690
you can always ask so this point I think

1269
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,480
which slows down today's session thank

1270
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,629
you
