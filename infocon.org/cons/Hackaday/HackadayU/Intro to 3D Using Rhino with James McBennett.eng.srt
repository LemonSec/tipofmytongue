hi i'm james and i've been using a wide

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,000
variety of 3d software for more than a

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,880
decade

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,240
the coolest project that i've ever

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,079
worked on is homocon ski jump in oslo

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,160
norway by julian de smet architects

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,600
for that project the team used one of my

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,760
favorite softwares rhino

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,199
more recently i've been obsessed with

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,359
cnc machines and furniture making

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,119
i use rhino almost daily to design

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,840
geometry and export it as tool paths

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,199
i've partnered with hackaday to bring

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:31,920
you this course

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,840
introduction to 3d using rhino as part

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,440
of their hackadayu program

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,800
on this course we'll start by learning

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,320
how to navigate 3d for the very first

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,879
time

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,079
then we'll learn how to create and edit

22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,920
different kinds of geometry and finish

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,440
by learning how to export that geometry

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200
to make something useful

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,440
you might want to 3d print or laser cut

26
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,800
something for a project you're working

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,440
on

28
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,120
or print an illustration on a t-shirt

29
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,800
you can download a 90-day free trial

30
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,320
from rhino but don't download that trial

31
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,079
too early so as to maximize the full use

32
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,280
of the 90 days

33
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,559
i look forward to working with you and

34
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,360
hope you'll join me on this course
