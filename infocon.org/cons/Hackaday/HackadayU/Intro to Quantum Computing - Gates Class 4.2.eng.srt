[Music]

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,800
welcome

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,759
and welcome back this is our fifth

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,960
session

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,039
at hackaday on quantum computing

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,600
and i know there are newcomers every

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,480
week so

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,600
just to show people there are a lot of

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,640
resources

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,840
you can find most of the links through

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,560
the

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,079
hackaday project is the introduction to

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,120
quantum computing

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,040
so every wednesday and sunday i post

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,719
some comics you can read about the topic

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
the topic is usually what we talk about

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,920
during this

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,360
class on sunday so if you

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,239
look at it on social media or hack a day

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:48,879
you

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,920
figure out what topic we'll talk about

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,399
so every sunday we meet for 30 minutes

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,199
describing

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,960
one concept and we would

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,399
also use some of the microsoft official

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,120
resources

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,240
for practices and

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,320
references so

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,360
i know um there

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,040
are newcomers and we have recording

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,759
four recordings so far from the past

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,560
class

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,360
so if there's anything from today's

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,439
class that's not clear to you

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,080
feel free to ask questions and also go

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,079
back to the previous recordings

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,320
so just now i heard there might be some

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,439
problems for

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,119
people not being able to view previous

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,280
recordings if that happens to you feel

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,720
free to let me know and

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,520
i'm trying to check if i can view those

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,320
videos also

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,360
so just to recap from last sunday

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,360
we discussed the concept of gates

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,240
and we introduced a graphical

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,680
presentation

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,799
called the bloch sphere to show

49
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,399
that any qubit is representable

50
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,598
on these sphere that is

51
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,360
telling us what the state vector is

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,239
so anywhere on this sphere we can

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:16,800
describe

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,720
it with angle theta and phi the

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,040
angle would then tell us the amplitude

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,080
of each

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,440
state how much of zero is in there and

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,080
how much of

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,000
one is there and zero and one are two

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,040
states in superposition and they are in

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,519
these

62
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,280
special locations on the poles

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,200
and because we can describe

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,599
uh if anyone's not muted please do so

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,800
right now

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,160
and after the 30 minutes we'll do the

67
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
question and discussion and you can

68
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,720
unmute yourself then thanks

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,080
the blog sphere because it shows us the

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,879
angles

71
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,560
that in order to manipulate the state

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,080
is basically manipulating the point on

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
the sphere

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,640
you can use a

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,000
matrix a 2 by 2 matrix

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,080
one of them can change the angle phi

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,280
phase phi the other is changing the

78
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,640
angle theta

79
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,680
and you can apply to this vector that's

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,519
describing qubit

81
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,920
that's what we talked about last time so

82
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,959
we introduced

83
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,840
a few

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,798
is the slice not full screen

85
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,360
i see full screen here sorry maybe you

86
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
can expand it a bit

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,480
sorry about that so last time we

88
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,760
also introduced some commonly used gates

89
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,120
the hard mark h gate remember that's

90
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,280
applying to either it can apply to any

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,120
vector but if you apply it to 0

92
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,560
or 1 you can see that they

93
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,720
change the location to this middle point

94
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,760
we call them plot state and minus 8.

95
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,280
this is a single qubit gate and we also

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
introduce

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,680
those x y z

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,400
polygates that are also single cubic

99
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,280
gates

100
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,320
they can rotate your state around

101
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,719
these x y and z axis

102
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,440
and

103
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,720
we mentioned that single qubit states

104
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
can be represented on block sphere and

105
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,400
then you can use

106
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,520
these two by two matrices

107
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,080
to manipulate them but of course there

108
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,040
are more

109
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,840
qubits that we need to worry about and

110
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,160
the

111
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,560
bloch sphere will no longer be used when

112
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
we expand to

113
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
multiple qubits and also there are gates

114
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,360
that

115
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,880
are used to apply to multiple qubits

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,160
now the uh

117
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,320
one of the most popular mostly used

118
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,560
multiple two qubit uh gates is the c nut

119
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,680
this is a four by four matrix

120
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
and i think there might be something

121
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,960
similar in

122
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,560
is now joining okay

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
i think there's something similar in

124
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,840
classical computing

125
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,199
there's something like controlled

126
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,440
not gate so it's the same idea that

127
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,120
is basically allowing your first qubit

128
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
to be a controver qubit

129
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
and your second qubit to be a target

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,199
and what it does is they say if the

131
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,320
control qubit

132
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,400
is zero then the target qubit doesn't

133
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,520
change

134
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,360
if the control qubit is one then

135
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,960
the target qubit has to flip we can see

136
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,520
this

137
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,120
from this four by four matrix

138
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,720
the form of this is almost a

139
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,759
identity matrix which doesn't change

140
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,319
anything

141
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,440
however the last quadrant is flipping

142
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,680
the location of zero and one

143
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,560
and what it does is really switching

144
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,120
your

145
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,240
vector these uh one by one

146
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
here is a two by two with the

147
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,479
two ones here in the first quadrant is

148
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,039
telling us it's preserving the first

149
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:37,919
qubit

150
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,479
but then when you applied it to the

151
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,560
second qubit it depends on your first

152
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,120
qubit

153
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,240
what to do with it the effect

154
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,120
of xenon is that if your first qubit is

155
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,080
zero

156
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,680
then your second qubit doesn't change

157
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,000
if your first qubit is one your second

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,880
qubit will be

159
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,199
different i would ask people to

160
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,479
try the math to to try of

161
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,680
exiting this four by four cubits

162
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,680
to your vector and this c naught is very

163
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,560
important

164
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,160
that almost well all of the

165
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,880
the algorithms that are useful that

166
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,400
we're going to look at

167
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,039
would use it and there's something that

168
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,039
i mentioned earlier that also

169
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,840
does that is some

170
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,360
manipulation uh some property for

171
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,319
quantum

172
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,360
mechanics that is being used in

173
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,440
every algorithm and

174
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
i would introduce you later so this is

175
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,160
just to show you

176
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,800
the matrices here for the interest of

177
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,280
time

178
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,759
i would not force you to do this matrix

179
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,759
but if you don't remember

180
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,440
the this is how you do matrix

181
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
multiplications

182
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
and please do try this at home

183
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,400
so we don't use

184
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,039
block sphere anymore as a graphical

185
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,479
representation

186
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,440
i have already explained last time that

187
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,120
it won't be

188
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,759
very helpful because block sphere can

189
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,800
only

190
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,560
represent in a three-dimensional space

191
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,240
for a vector and when you have

192
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,039
multiple qubits that's a

193
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,360
multi-dimensional

194
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,800
more than three dimension

195
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,399
geometry space so

196
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,880
for us we can't really see anything

197
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,080
beyond three dimensions

198
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,719
so we're not going to use block sphere

199
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,519
it's not

200
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,640
it's only helpful when you want to see

201
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,200
how that one qubits can change

202
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,720
but we can introduce another

203
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,480
graphical representation that

204
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,279
can help us when we have a few more

205
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,040
qubits

206
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,160
it's very simple it's like the music

207
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,200
notes where line would

208
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,320
represent how your music progress

209
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,920
over time we also use the line

210
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,000
to represent the progression with time

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,880
but this time is to just use a line to

212
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,519
represent

213
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,360
a cubit so the state a here is our qubit

214
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,800
and you can draw a line to represent it

215
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
if you have two cubits that's two lines

216
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,480
three qubits three lines

217
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,080
and qubits you draw and n lines

218
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,640
so in terms of the c naught gate that we

219
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,360
just

220
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,120
talked about it has a symbol that

221
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
connects

222
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,440
the two lines because it's a four by

223
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,320
four matrix

224
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,080
it acts on two qubits

225
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
and it also tells us the top line

226
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,240
the one with the black dot is the

227
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
control

228
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,800
and the one with this circle cross

229
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,079
is target

230
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,079
that's it this is the circuit

231
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,000
representation

232
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
very straightforward and especially for

233
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,959
the single gate qubits

234
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,680
you can just write it down like a box

235
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,079
with

236
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,360
the label with the letter and there are

237
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,079
a lot

238
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,120
of gates out there

239
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,839
you can just do a search online you see

240
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,240
this

241
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,120
graph in wikipedia this is showing some

242
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,160
of the most

243
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,399
commonly used gates and you can see the

244
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,279
there are other control gates and there

245
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,320
are also these

246
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,720
swap gates that basic swaps the two

247
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,440
qubits

248
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,560
you can also have this cc knot that is

249
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,000
having two controls and one target

250
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,040
so if you're interested you can try

251
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,680
these math

252
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,640
and see how they do what they do to your

253
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,120
qubits

254
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,519
and gates we also mentioned is a

255
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,920
reversible

256
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,200
property but measurement is not

257
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,640
reversible

258
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,880
yet we can still use a graphic

259
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,160
presentation to

260
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,440
represent the measurement is

261
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,720
it looks like a probe dial so this is

262
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,600
how we

263
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,120
draw measurement is also

264
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,079
what's different is that it's not

265
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,040
reversible

266
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
and after a measurement of a cubic you

267
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,720
get a piece of classical information out

268
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,360
you because you cannot then reverse it

269
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,160
back to

270
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,680
quantum so we use two lines to represent

271
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,240
the

272
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,279
output is classical

273
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,839
that's it so here

274
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,120
is what i mentioned there's something

275
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,720
that we using

276
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,440
in all the algorithms is entanglement

277
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,320
we have actually used what you have

278
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,880
learned

279
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,760
so far to construct entanglement

280
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,680
and namely bell states when you have

281
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,920
two qubits and that's the

282
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,040
mostly used

283
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,800
property in a quantum algorithm

284
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,839
you always want to entangle your qubits

285
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,440
to make your algorithms

286
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,880
useful and to

287
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,920
entangle two qubits all you have to do

288
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,959
is to first

289
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,959
apply a hard mark gate and then

290
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,959
put a c not gate to combine the two

291
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,399
states so let's take a look at

292
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,760
how this really works step by step this

293
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,560
table already tells you what your

294
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,120
outcome

295
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,480
will look like so if you have these four

296
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,720
possibilities your outputs

297
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,079
will be those four bell states

298
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,200
thousands if you haven't learned it it

299
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,120
is introduced in i think

300
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,360
the third session

301
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,120
so please take a look after class if

302
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,760
this is

303
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,120
a new term for you let's just take a

304
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,760
look at

305
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
the math how everything works out so

306
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,959
that also

307
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,399
can help you and remind you how

308
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,160
it works what happens if you apply

309
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,320
a h gate to a qubit so say if you had a

310
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,880
zero

311
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,399
in your first qubit you apply a h gate

312
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,160
then this is the first

313
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,920
super position you will get is equally

314
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,720
distributed

315
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,040
among zero and one like what i showed

316
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,959
earlier in the block sphere they

317
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,399
flip they would move the bases

318
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,600
for this top down

319
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,120
zero and one on the z axis to

320
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
the middle one along the x-axis

321
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,240
basically

322
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
each the harmona gate changes your basis

323
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,639
of the system if your first

324
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,760
bit is one you get the same thing except

325
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,160
the minus sign there this is our minus

326
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,040
state so

327
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,279
okay so that's our first step applying

328
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,600
to the first

329
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,959
qubit then it depends on what your

330
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,719
second qubit initially is

331
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,120
this is how you can write it out

332
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,519
h times your first qubit

333
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,880
you write the outputs there and then you

334
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,279
do

335
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,079
your second qubit you just add it in

336
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,040
here

337
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,079
so having the zero and one

338
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,360
inside the same bracket or the two

339
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,240
separate bracket

340
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,079
is the same thing so you write this

341
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,440
out here then you will need to

342
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,959
apply a c naught so given

343
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,040
your first qubit is zero

344
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,199
if then your second qubit wouldn't

345
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:19,680
change

346
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,399
in this case so it would be zero zero

347
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,839
here

348
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,160
but if you are looking at this

349
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,440
possibility

350
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,720
here if your second if your first qubit

351
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,279
is one

352
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,680
then your second qubit have to flip so

353
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,000
it becomes one right here

354
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,120
so now just um

355
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,399
you could write out all the matrices

356
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,600
to do the full calculation if you want

357
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,480
but just by looking at this you already

358
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,199
can see

359
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,240
why the answer is this so 0

360
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,600
1 staying there one that

361
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,639
this one will be zero so that's one zero

362
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,000
similar here with the minus signs so

363
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,480
now that's how you make a thousand state

364
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,839
once you put this

365
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,680
into a bell state then they are

366
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,040
entangled

367
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,759
two qubits you cannot separate them out

368
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,240
until

369
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,440
you do a reverse so remember all the

370
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,079
gates

371
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,320
are reversible you could then

372
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920
disentangle them

373
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,360
by applying a cena and then age gate

374
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,959
so try it out yourself

375
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,240
let's put everything together into a

376
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,560
full algorithm

377
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,519
this is the teleportation circuit

378
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,720
i mentioned teleportation before

379
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
without really showing you any of the

380
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,160
mass and

381
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,920
and these circuit representation

382
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,639
so let's review the story here when we

383
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,680
have

384
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,240
two entangled qubits so say alice and

385
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,720
bob they are trying to

386
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,639
communicate they first would prepare

387
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,559
a pair of entangled vowel states

388
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,400
and then alice then obtains a new

389
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,160
cubit a plot dash

390
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,439
and she wants bob to know what this is

391
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,400
but

392
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,559
she can't directly tell him just for for

393
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,000
the sake of argument

394
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,480
she maybe doesn't want other people to

395
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,199
see it or

396
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,439
whatever reason she cannot directly give

397
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,039
bob a

398
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,559
dash but then she could

399
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,919
entangle her two cubits that she has in

400
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,480
her possession

401
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,880
then she does a measurement to her

402
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,480
cubits

403
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,520
based on her results

404
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,679
she can tell bob what to do with his

405
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,120
qubit

406
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,160
basically applying some gates

407
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,200
to change bob's cubit to

408
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,640
a dash so this is the teleportation

409
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,000
circuit this is

410
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,360
how teleportation oxidism works is that

411
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,039
there's no direct exchange of qubits

412
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,080
but then you use

413
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,720
entanglement to let the other person

414
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,520
know

415
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,160
the information the new information that

416
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,919
you want them to know

417
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,799
so it's kind of teleported your

418
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,919
information to them

419
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,799
without the physical exchange and

420
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,760
because

421
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,799
they they can do this because

422
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,760
they know what the outcome would be

423
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,840
based on the initial

424
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,919
entangled state that they put their

425
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,160
qubits in

426
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,559
so let's look at the circuit again i

427
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,080
just

428
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,880
went through the story but this is how

429
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,000
they can do it

430
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,440
in the inner algorithm they can

431
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,559
entangle to give bits using the h and

432
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,280
c naught and then she can entangle hers

433
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,240
using

434
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,440
h and c naught and then she just do

435
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,000
a measurement of both of her qubits

436
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,440
based on the result

437
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,799
um bob would either do an x gate

438
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,960
or a z gate or x plus that k

439
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,600
or nothing so this table shows

440
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,280
if alice's two qubits

441
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,480
after she does the measurement becomes 0

442
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,520
and 1 then

443
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,240
we know bob's qubit will be this one

444
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,679
and he he doesn't have to do anything

445
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,600
if the first two cubits are zero and one

446
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,880
the third qubit would be

447
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,000
this one oh i didn't mention

448
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,440
that just say using

449
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,039
this as alice's new

450
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,400
qubit i will show you in detail how it

451
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,480
works in a bit

452
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,400
so if bob gets this state then he has to

453
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,280
apply

454
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,480
the x gate in order to get to this

455
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,679
state similarly with the other

456
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,320
two options so let's just take a look in

457
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,919
detail

458
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,600
what this is all about so

459
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,159
let's just for the sake of argument this

460
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,120
table

461
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,400
applies to the bowel state

462
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,720
if they start their entanglement with

463
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,760
this bowel state

464
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,679
this is this is the table that they will

465
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,120
get

466
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,880
step by step they first prepare

467
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,280
their qubits in this plus bell state

468
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,120
and then we say just let a

469
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,559
dash be this arbitrary state we don't

470
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,840
know what alpha and beta

471
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
are

472
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,240
then you have alice's new

473
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,080
state a dash and um

474
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,200
part of one of

475
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,240
this first qubit belongs to alice so the

476
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,360
whole system

477
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,640
is a dash and

478
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,440
five plus if you write the whole thing

479
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,640
out

480
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,840
this is your phi plus this is your a

481
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,880
dash

482
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,080
and you can expand it it becomes four

483
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,240
terms

484
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,559
these are also you can see this is the

485
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,200
what you would get just by writing down

486
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,559
the qubits one by one so zero

487
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,799
zero zero zero one one one zero zero

488
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,320
one one so you get four possible terms

489
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,720
in superposition

490
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,440
now you want to entangle alice's two

491
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,400
qubits which

492
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,679
are the first

493
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,039
qubit and the second qubit

494
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,400
you do a c naught there which would then

495
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,600
apply to the first

496
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,080
two gilberts and change the setup

497
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,080
into this state here

498
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,080
and then you apply uh each gate

499
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,240
so i should slow down this

500
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,840
a lot of zeros and ones um

501
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,320
so i'm gonna talk slowly here when you

502
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,039
apply

503
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,039
a h to the state here

504
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,159
you is only applying to

505
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,039
the first qubit so you just write out

506
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,400
what you would expect from zero

507
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,919
and once

508
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,559
so that's what your whole system

509
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,080
the three qubits become after you

510
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,840
do this

511
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,640
entanglement

512
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,720
now this is what your system looks like

513
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,919
after this step

514
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,840
so then what happens if you do a

515
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,039
measurement

516
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,840
so alice has these two qubits she would

517
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,960
do a measurement for each

518
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,280
if the first qubit is zero

519
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,480
the state after the measurement will

520
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,039
only

521
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,159
have these two terms

522
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,440
because the other two terms have one as

523
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,400
their

524
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,600
outcome so those would cancel out if

525
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,880
if her outcome is zero then it's not

526
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,120
possible to have these terms still in

527
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,840
your

528
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,200
system so only these

529
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,720
two terms are left

530
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,799
and this is written in a way that it

531
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,080
shows you these

532
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,960
two qubits first that belong to alice

533
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,320
then she does another measurement

534
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,440
if again she gets so this measurement is

535
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
now on the second

536
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,760
uh sorry um yeah on her second qubit

537
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,880
if she gets another zero then this term

538
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,159
is then eliminated it's not possible

539
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,840
that she would measure zero when

540
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,360
when this term is one here so you only

541
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,559
have this term

542
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,559
left in your system after these two

543
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,880
measurements

544
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,720
now look at this form here

545
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,240
this is where

546
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,360
we want bob to know

547
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,120
this is a dash this aperture state so

548
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,320
without doing anything bob's

549
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,240
state we know when he does a measurement

550
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,880
he'll get this

551
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,799
it automatically comes out as a result

552
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,720
that this arbitrary

553
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,919
state is the same thing

554
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,540
in bob's hand so

555
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,600
[Music]

556
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,720
this is a very interesting thing about

557
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,919
in a teleportation circuit

558
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,640
that shows you how entanglement works is

559
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,720
that there's no

560
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,960
exchange of circuits but then you know

561
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,120
what bob will get

562
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,559
so this is just saying using

563
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,080
this first example here but then if you

564
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,760
pick a another one like 1 0 if alice

565
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,880
first qubit is 1 then these

566
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,480
two are the terms that the system will

567
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,039
be left

568
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,360
with after the first measurement and

569
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,240
then if your

570
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,600
second qubit is zero then this

571
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,840
would be the term so what bob will have

572
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,360
will be this bell state here

573
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,600
and alice looks at her table

574
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,880
knowing that this would be what bob

575
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,159
gets she calls bob and tell him

576
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,600
do a set gate to your

577
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,720
state then you will get what i want

578
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,760
you to have so that's

579
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,679
it this is our famous teleportation

580
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,960
algorithm there are a lot of

581
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,640
other algorithms and it will get

582
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,679
more and more complex

583
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,520
when we have a small number of qubits we

584
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,400
can

585
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,520
represent the system nicely with

586
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,039
a circuit however when we

587
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,919
have more complex algorithms that we

588
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:36,640
involve

589
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,000
large number of qubits we would

590
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,520
get into a very messy stage where

591
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,880
we have to draw all of the cubits and

592
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,200
see

593
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,760
how they change every step that becomes

594
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,520
not scalable

595
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,120
so these are some of the

596
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,440
most famous algorithms

597
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,159
that really build the foundation of

598
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,000
quantum computing

599
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,240
we would go into a few of them

600
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,440
in the next classes

601
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,039
um we can still write circuit

602
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,320
representations for them when we pick a

603
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,640
small number of qubits but then think

604
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,000
about the

605
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,320
possibility you have to handle a

606
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,399
thousand cubit to really write something

607
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,600
useful

608
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,080
then it's not really scalable that's

609
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,200
when we

610
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,200
really need to have a high level

611
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,640
quantum algorithm to represent those

612
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,440
sorry high level quantum language to

613
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,760
represent those algorithms

614
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,360
that that's like when you write

615
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,559
a classical auxin nowadays you don't

616
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,200
look at

617
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,279
how your individual transistor behaves

618
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,159
so same thing in quantum computing you

619
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:00,720
wouldn't

620
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,039
want to look at how each individual

621
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,720
qubit behaves

622
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,840
when you do a really complex

623
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,120
quantum algorithm so we would

624
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,320
get into q sharp the language

625
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,480
that is high level and is full stack

626
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,080
specifically designed for quantum

627
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,000
computing we would

628
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,120
try to learn it and use it

629
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,159
for constructing circuits or

630
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,960
and build much bigger programs

631
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,080
last class i showed people there are

632
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,320
some very nice exercises

633
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,679
that we developed to teach people about

634
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,799
q sharp

635
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,000
this is quantum catas you can go to this

636
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,640
link

637
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,159
the slides will be shared on hacker day

638
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,399
but you can also just search quantum

639
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,880
cutters this will pop up

640
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,279
they have a nice set of

641
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,799
very interesting problems

642
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,440
building up from very simple to

643
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,760
gradually more complex

644
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,919
and we have tutorials to guide you

645
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,679
through those

646
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,640
based on what we have learned so far in

647
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,919
the past five sessions

648
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,399
including today these are the ones that

649
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,520
you can already

650
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,039
take a step at with not

651
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,080
much looking for new for information

652
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,159
just follow the tutorials you should be

653
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,080
able to do a lot of the

654
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,960
basics gates and the superposition and

655
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,600
measurements

656
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,880
teleportation cutters

657
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,480
and we have some um other algorithm

658
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,880
that we haven't talked about in this

659
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,159
sessions yet

660
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,039
you can also just take a look at it it's

661
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:49,600
got

662
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,000
a very nice self-paced explanation

663
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,120
try to do some of these before the next

664
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,679
few classes but we will we would get

665
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,480
into

666
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,679
some of these later

667
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,080
and i think because of the interest in

668
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,159
this class

669
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,440
i wonder perhaps before we go into those

670
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,000
algorithms we should

671
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,799
take a detour and talk about some of the

672
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,520
hardware

673
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,159
systems yeah i think people will like

674
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,120
that

675
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,640
and there might be a twitch live stream

676
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,279
for

677
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,919
this class starting next week i'm still

678
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,840
trying to figure out how that works

679
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,559
i haven't done any twitch streaming

680
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,600
before but

681
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,240
microsoft has this channel that i could

682
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,880
use

683
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,720
so maybe once if that's set up then

684
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,440
i could add a link there and i don't

685
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,720
know how that works

686
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,600
uh combining a twitch streaming with the

687
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,279
teams

688
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,640
uh so we'll figure out the technical

689
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,360
things and see what works back i think

690
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,360
teams works really well so we may keep

691
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,480
this and have

692
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,880
twitch open at the same time but if it

693
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,159
doesn't support

694
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,760
two tools then i may update a twitch

695
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,799
stream on the hackaday projects

696
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,559
thanks yeah um thanks aaron yeah i would

697
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,279
ask you questions if we like we can't

698
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,880
solve it

699
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,159
and then we will also have some sessions

700
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:20,559
on

701
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,640
learning q sharp and writing some

702
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,840
algorithms

703
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,960
using the quantum development kit and

704
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,640
the cutoffs

705
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,840
okay that's it for today
