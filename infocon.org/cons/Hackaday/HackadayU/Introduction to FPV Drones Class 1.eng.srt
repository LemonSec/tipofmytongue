when a drone flies in 3d space

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,800
and digital signal processing uh how rc

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,879
link work and so many things and

18

started so

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,280
i'll quickly show you the setup which

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,879
i'm going to be using for this course

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,079

i'm trying to

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,600
teach here so it's here's my setup and

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,320
you can see

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,080
this is the main camera which is

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,840
recording and here i am recording my

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,640
screen

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,560
so on the screen we have different

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,840
setups i have set up an

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,720
overhead camera so this i will be using

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,080
for teaching

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,640
anything which is related to the drone

38
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,240
parts and showing different components

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,159
that goes inside the drone

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,040
then this is a hybrid kind of view where

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,159
you can see the overhead camera and

42
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,880
alongside

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,320

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,199
showed in uh last slide so

174
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,639
i'm always happy to help and uh the

175
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,440
friend uh the one page which is your

176
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,080
best friend

177
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,600
for this course is the link that is

178
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
flashing at the bottom of the screen

179
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,240
so this is the main hacker day page

180
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,960
course

181
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
uh where you can find every information

182
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
related to this class so this is a

183
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,160
project called introduction to fpv

184
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,600
drones where

185
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,560
i will be posting all the slides which

186
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,000
i'm showing i will be posting all these

187
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,479
videos and everything here you can find

188
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,080
and also some reading materials which i

189
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,919
will be sharing starting i believe next

190
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:02,639
class or so

191
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,280
as uh they are still a work in progress

192
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,319
so

193
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,039
bookmark that link and use that wisely

194
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,240
so

195
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
that is about the weekly class and this

196
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,720
office servers apart from that

197
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,800
there is a structure to this entire

198
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
course so this course is divided into

199
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,080
two parts part a which

200
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,560
we have started today and thereafter the

201
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,440
part b

202
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,160
so in each part we have four classes in

203
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,000
the class one that is today we are going

204
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
to talk about introduction to

205
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,479
unmanned aerial vehicles and propeller

206
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,600
selection process

207
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
so data is about today's class and in

208
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,440
the next class we will be talking about

209
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,759
frame selection and transmitters and

210
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,039
receivers

211
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,039
uh after that we will be talking about

212
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
motors electronic speed controllers and

213
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,919
batteries

214
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,720
so this is the third class and in the

215
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,639
final class of part a we will be talking

216
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,120
about

217
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,880
flight controller and digital signal

218
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,800
processing so that will conclude the

219
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,680
part a

220
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,440
after that we'll start the part b in

221
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,880
which we will be talking about

222
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,639
introduction to first person view and

223
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,080
telemetry in class

224
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,319
fifth and in the class six we'll be

225
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,520
talking about putting everything

226
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,800
together where we take all the

227
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,919
components and

228
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,280
put it together to make a drone just

229
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,240
uh like you can see here so a complete

230
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,759
drone with everything which would be

231
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,800
able to fly

232
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,000
uh and then in the seventh

233
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,160
seventh class we will be talking about

234
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
software comes into the picture

235
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,919
uh because the drone is not only about

236
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,440
the hardware there are also software

237
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,039
component that is involved a lot of

238
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,960
programming a lot of

239
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,720
control system and digital signal

240
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,560
processing needs to be coded which goes

241
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,919
inside this and makes

242
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,720
it stable and flyable in the air so

243
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
we're going to be talking about that in

244
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,199
the class seven

245
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,880
and in the final class we will be taking

246
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,560
the first flight we will be talking

247
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
about tuning uh because every drone is

248
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,080
different every part is different you

249
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,400
need

250
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,840
tweet you need to tune your drone

251
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,759
according to your needs uh we were

252
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,440
talking about safety checks and basic

253
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
mistakes which you can avoid so that

254
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,039
concludes the entire course and

255
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,520
the part b so to take the part b the

256
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
prerequisites are

257
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,720
part a which is already

258
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,639
started here so let's talk about today's

259
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,039
agenda and the agenda for today's class

260
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,160
as i already mentioned

261
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
so first of all we'll start by talking

262
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
about the kit because a lot of people

263
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,479
would have a question that what part

264
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,080
should i buy if i want to make a drone

265
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,520
so i'm going to clearing

266
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
i am going to be clearing that doubt in

267
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,160
the very beginning of this class after

268
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
that we were talking about drone laws

269
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
around the world because

270
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
that is where the legal part comes into

271
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,519
the picture and nobody

272
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,479
wants to be get sued for building or

273
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,919
flying drones so we will be talking

274
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,240
about drone laws around the world

275
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,080
then i will be sharing some applications

276
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,360
of uavs because

277
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,800
of course if you are taking the course

278
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,839
you should be knowing what are the

279
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,680
different applications of uavs and how

280
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,440
drones are being used around this world

281
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,320
for

282
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,720
different purposes so that we will also

283
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,120
cover in today's class

284
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
after that we will be talking about what

285
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,240
are drones so uh

286
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,880
what exactly is a drone world exactly is

287
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
a technical scientific correct

288
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,160
definition of a drone because

289
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
when we talk about drone it's a very

290
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,680
very wide thing it involves a lot of

291
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
different things so what counts as a

292
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,160
drone word count

293
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,519
what doesn't count as a drone we will

294
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,200
talking about that in

295
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,839
this section of this class uh then we'll

296
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,360
start the real fun thing

297
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,519
uh talk about physics which keep a drone

298
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,279
in there and we will be going back to

299
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,440
some basic fundamental of physics forces

300
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,880
and what not so

301
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,720
that is also we will be covering in

302
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
today's class

303
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,640
after that we'll we'll continue with the

304
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,399
physics and talk about degree of freedom

305
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,760
and what degree of freedom a

306
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
flying body has in terms of your pitch

307
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,279
and role and

308
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,920
how they are achieved how these motions

309
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,040
are achieved by different

310
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
kinds of drones or uavs

311
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,399
after that we'll be talking about basic

312
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,760
innovation the signal processing and

313
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,440
sensor involved there is an

314
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,160
entire class dedicated to this topic but

315
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
i will be touching upon this in today's

316
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,920
class because it's important to have a

317
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,680
basic understanding of

318
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,760
why these things are required when we

319
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,600
are flying a drone using a remote why

320
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
do we still need signal processing why

321
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,200
do we need sensor when we can manually

322
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,399
control with the remote

323
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,760
so i will be touching up on that in

324
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,000
today's class but uh definitely we will

325
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,959
be talking about

326
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,279
much more details in future classes uh

327
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,200
then we will be having a basic talk on

328
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,040
all the components so drone is

329
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,240
a multi uh processor system where

330
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,839
different kinds of things happening at

331
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,079
the same time at a very high speed

332
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,240
uh we were talking about motor csc

333
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
flight controller and all kind of things

334
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,640
and how all these things comes together

335
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,760
to make a drone a make a uav

336
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,519
we will be talking about in greater

337
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,279
details in their respective chapters as

338
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,560
i showed you before but

339
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,320
uh today we will be just touching upon

340
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,079
them and just giving you a basic

341
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,279
introduction about how

342
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,480
these things uh work together

343
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,160
then in the last part of this class we

344
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
were talking about propeller selection

345
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,720
guide and

346
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,560
if you talk about this propeller this is

347
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
like a small

348
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,360
uh plastic fan and this is

349
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
like the cheapest component of the drone

350
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
but still the most important

351
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
component in my opinion and in today's

352
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,560
class we'll be talking about

353
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,800
how to choose a propeller based on what

354
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,399
are different types of propeller what

355
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,839
are the material used to make these

356
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,720
propellers

357
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,120
and size of propellers and how that

358
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,279
matters in your drone selection

359
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,399
the pitch of the propeller and whatnot

360
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,360
so let's start this class by talking

361
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,320
about the kit

362
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,040
and if you want to make your own drone

363
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,800
and if you have already make your

364
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,160
head make your own drone in the past

365
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,000
then you know that a lot of different

366
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
things are required to build a drone you

367
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,279
need a transmitter you need a receiver

368
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,519
you need a frame you need motors

369
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,360
electronic speed controller and all kind

370
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,800
of things so

371
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,320
it is not cheap it is very expensive

372
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,920
hobby to build a drone

373
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,839
and hundreds of dollars and thousands of

374
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,839
dollars can be invested to

375
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,560
make the right drone for your choosing

376
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:50,959
uh

377
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,040
but i want to convey here that the only

378
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,519
reason i have not given any list

379
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,000
of parts which i recommend is because of

380
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,360
multiple reasons so

381
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,920
the biggest reason of among all is the

382
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
availability

383
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,760
so uh people have joined this class from

384
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,720
everywhere in

385
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,959
the world and if i recommend one

386
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,240
particular frame

387
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,600
that may not be available in your

388
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,279
country the seller might not ship into

389
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,720
your country

390
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,800
that you need to find the alternatives

391
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,440
uh same goes for motor same goes for esc

392
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
then you have if you import then you

393
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,720
have some custom issues because there

394
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,839
are some

395
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,519
frequency related things that are

396
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,040
involved in these things and

397
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,959
not every country has very suitable

398
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,320
rules for that thing

399
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,040
if i talk about india it's not legal to

400
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,639
import anything that is

401
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,480
doing any frequency transmission which

402
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,000
has a radio in it without getting

403
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,839
a license from communication in uh

404
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,360
ministry so

405
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,959
maybe your country has some similar

406
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,760
rules and some countries are also banned

407
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,320
importing uh any parts which is stacked

408
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,839
as a drone so that is also another

409
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:50,880
problem

410
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,320
uh then the other thing which hinders me

411
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,480
from recommending any particular kit

412
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,800
is uh because of different requirements

413
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,760
so

414
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,160
a lot of people have joined this course

415
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
with the hope that they will be able to

416
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,040
build the drone but

417
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
not everyone would be willing to make a

418
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,720
same kind of drone

419
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,480
uh for example there could be some of

420
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,160
you out there who wanted to make a drone

421
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,040
for drone racing for drone freestyle

422
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,279
uh first person view video or just

423
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,880
getting the adrenaline out of fast

424
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,440
flying fpv racing freestyle drones

425
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,200
but there may also be some of you that

426
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
want to build an autonomous drones maybe

427
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,519
to do some application like

428
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,600
deploying a payload at a particular

429
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,120
latitude and longitude

430
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,760
at particular gps location or you will

431
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,399
be

432
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,320
wanting a very stable platform for

433
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,639
aerial videography platform

434
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,880
aerial videography drone with the glim

435
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,959
with gimbal to make uh stabilize your

436
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,079
footage

437
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,680
or maybe there are some of you who wants

438
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,079
to just build a drone which

439
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,079
is used for indoor flying just like the

440
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,320
one you can see on the screen on the

441
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
right inside the small drone which

442
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,000
is like a toy drone which is used

443
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,680
indoors so

444
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,760
that is the reason i have not provided

445
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,199
any kit so

446
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,880
a lot of you are out there having

447
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,399
different requirements of different

448
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,560
application you want to build drone

449
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,880
but one thing i can promise you is if

450
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,560
you take this course very seriously by

451
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,160
the end of this course you would be able

452
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,199
to choose

453
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,680
and mix and match your own parts you

454
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,639
would know that

455
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,800
what size of propeller goes with which

456
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,639
motor and which motor goes with which

457
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,279
esc

458
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,680
and what frame should be right for you

459
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,399
and

460
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,880
what are different uh let's say the

461
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,720
flight controller available for you if

462
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,160
you want to make an autonomous

463
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,360
drone you don't need to buy a

464
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
transmitter you can send the commands

465
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,680
using your computer your laptop

466
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,800
but then you will need to buy a bit more

467
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,399
advanced flight controller which can

468
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:40,880
take

469
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,160
gps sensors which can take magnetometer

470
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,480
and barometer and whatnot if you want to

471
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
want to build a drone for fpv drone

472
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,519
racing then you need to

473
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,399
have a small frame with five to six inch

474
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,600
of propeller

475
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,399
but you need to take a very fast flight

476
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,920
controller which can do processing very

477
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,560
fast because the drone fly very fast and

478
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,120
the drone frame should also be solid and

479
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
rigid enough to take some beating

480
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,560
because if you fly at the speed of

481
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,600
150 200 miles per hour then

482
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,199
if you crash then your frame is going to

483
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,120
crash then you need different kinds of

484
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,440
frames which are made of carbon fiber

485
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,360
but while if you are making a drone for

486
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,720
autonomous navigation

487
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,959
which is very stable platform you can

488
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,959
save some money and you can buy a wooden

489
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,600
frame

490
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,760
which is more suitable for that kind of

491
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,800
application

492
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,720
so that is the entire reason i have not

493
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,800
recommended any kit here and

494
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,000
trust me if you take this class

495
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,160
seriously and if you go through each and

496
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,560
every

497
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,320
class then at the end of this course you

498
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,160
would be in a position to

499
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,199
mix and match your own parts and

500
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,800
i'll definitely share some of the

501
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,480
websites i know from different part of

502
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,759
the world and some of the website that

503
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,440
can ship worldwide

504
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,360
from where i have i have bought the

505
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,600
parts but one thing is there that

506
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,440
i cannot recommend any particular kit

507
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,079
and i cannot guarantee if these parts

508
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,160
work together so you need to take this

509
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,920
class seriously and of course i will be

510
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,440
there to help you in the office hours

511
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
and then you can pick your own parts and

512
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,480
you can make your own drone

513
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,639
uh based on what requirements you have

514
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,399
what applications you have in mind

515
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,519
so for now please don't buy the kit yet

516
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,160
okay so moving on before the fun stuff

517
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
start let's talk about drone laws around

518
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,360
this world and why it is important so

519
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,279
when you have a flying camera in there

520
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,959
which is sending a live feed

521
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,639
on your goggles on your screen on your

522
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,639
laptop then it becomes a liability for

523
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,120
local law enforcement to see that you

524
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,240
are not misusing it

525
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,399
you are not using it to invade anyone

526
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,360
privacy

527
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,279
you are not using it for any illegal

528
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,759
purposes so that is why the aviation

529
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,680
bodies around this world has

530
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,000
made some laws which suit their local

531
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
law enforcement so

532
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
if you talk about india there is a body

533
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,519
called dgca which regulates all the

534
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,040
flying activity in the country it's

535
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,480
called directorate journal of civil

536
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,519
aviation

537
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,160
which has formulated the laws for indian

538
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,040
subcontinent

539
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
uh regarding the drones if you talk

540
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,160
about the united states there is faa

541
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,000
which has formulated the drone laws and

542
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,760
different sections and different

543
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,799
licensings which you need to

544
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,599
need to take an exam to get some license

545
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:13,919
to

546
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,959
legally fly drone so with this course

547
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,480
the motive is just to give you

548
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,240
the information to make your own drone

549
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,439
the knowledge which goes inside the

550
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,240
drone the physics the mathematics the

551
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,919
programming the signal processing and

552
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,359
the control system

553
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,360
but when you make drone that is

554
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,200
completely your liability and

555
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,960
you need to be a responsible pilot you

556
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,120
need to be a responsible engineer to fly

557
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,840
it

558
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
you need to be very responsible so you

559
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,200
are not using it for any illegal

560
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,120
purposes you are not using it to invade

561
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
anyone privacy and

562
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,120
that is totally up to you as a drone

563
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,000
builder as a drone

564
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,240
pilot to make sure that you're not doing

565
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,160
anything wrong or illegal using your

566
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,880
drone

567
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,200
so before flying any drone or even in

568
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
some countries before building any drone

569
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,600
do check out your local laws and make

570
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,440
sure you are in the limits of

571
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,120
the law before uh taking any flight

572
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
and if you need any license to carry the

573
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
drone if you need another license to fly

574
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,320
the drone make sure you also have that

575
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,679
before you do so

576
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,960
uh i as an instructor or this hacker deu

577
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,880
platform or any of the related entity

578
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,720
will not be responsible if you use your

579
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,440
drone in

580
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,440
any uh purposes which are not legal so

581
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,039
make sure you do check out your legal

582
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,440
laws around in your country and

583
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,280
you do abide by that before flying your

584
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,520
drone so that is a small thing which i

585
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,120
wanted to communicate before starting

586
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,160
this course

587
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,120
uh now we can move ahead to the fun

588
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,400
parts and let's talk about

589
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,320
applications of uav so when you have a

590
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,160
flying camera in air and especially one

591
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,440
which is sending live

592
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,280
real-time video feed in your ground

593
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
station it opens a door for a lot of

594
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
different applications around this world

595
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,440
and

596
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
a lot of different problems can be

597
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,840
solved from disaster management to

598
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,160
sending quick help to monitoring

599
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,039
wildlife

600
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,520
and for avoiding poaching and a lot of

601
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,200
different things and these kinds of

602
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
applications drone has been deployed

603
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,960
around this world and

604
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,640
i have shortlisted a few to share with

605
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,480
you uh different applications around

606
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,919
this world

607
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,080
which are where the drones are being

608
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,960
used to solve some

609
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
sort of problems and uh there are few

610
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,200
which i have shortlisted but there are

611
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,799
hundreds and thousands of application

612
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,799
where drones can be used to solve any

613
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,520
problem

614
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,200
and maybe you can get some ideas seeing

615
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,039
these applications and you can also

616
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,799
solve some sort of problems so let's see

617
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,919
the very first one

618
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,840
is from a university in netherlands

619
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,679
called tu delft and

620
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,200
they have created a concept drone

621
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,360
ambulance so

622
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,600
as you can see a person here is

623
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,679
suffering from a cardiac arrest and

624
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,480
in situation like this getting quick

625
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,039
help is

626
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,280
all that is needed to save someone life

627
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,400
and

628
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,760
in a country with a lot of traffic

629
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,440
especially like india ambulance can take

630
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,039
a lot of time to reach and

631
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,240
a lot of people die every year just

632
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,320
because they cannot get help on time

633
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,400
so here this lady called the hospital

634
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,080
where they sent a

635
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,960
drone a very high speed drone so as i

636
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,840
can see it's a

637
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,480
y6 kind of drone where you have three

638
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
motors on up and three motors on the

639
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,440
down and you get

640
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,000
a very high payload carrying capacity

641
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,919
and as soon as a drone lands it fold

642
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,960
itself and

643
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,520
this can be picked up by the lady so the

644
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,039
gps coordinates of this

645
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,600
lady was set as you can see in the one

646
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,159
glimpse

647
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,600
where they use that gps coordinate to

648
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,880
send the drone and the drone is carrying

649
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,400
some sort of emergency

650
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,280
equipments which are being used and the

651
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,240
directions are

652
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
being provided by the doctors live the

653
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,400
camera is mounted on the drone

654
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,840
so you can see in about 1 minute 58

655
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,280
second

656
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,200
this concept has been demonstrated to

657
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
show how drones can be quickly used to

658
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,120
send quick help and

659
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,200
that's a very very good application and

660
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,400
if these kind of things can be

661
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,120
implemented

662
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,080
a lot of lives can be saved every year

663
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,960
so

664
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,559
moving ahead to the next application

665
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,000
this might already

666
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,840
uh you have been seen in lot of

667
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,480
different things so

668
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,320
drone are being tested to use for

669
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,960
quick delivery and this is an amazon

670
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,360
prime

671
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,840
air they called and they promise so it's

672
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,120
a concept again so

673
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,720
but the but the concept promise to

674
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,799
deliver your parcel in 30 minutes if it

675
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,080
is under a certain

676
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,000
uh weight limit which a drone can lift

677
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,240
so this is a standard packaging the

678
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,760
standard dimensions

679
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,000
which matches with the drone and as soon

680
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,039
as you order this

681
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,679
amazon prime air drone it gets coupled

682
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,640
with the package

683
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,400
and it will take a flight so

684
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,039
again a concept but trust me a lot of

685
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,760
different companies around the world has

686
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,480
already been testing uh this kinds of

687
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,039
concept

688
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,240
for delivery packages and even in india

689
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,120
someone a few years back in mumbai

690
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
tested the pizza delivery successfully

691
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,480
with this drone

692
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,159
the drone laws were not there at that

693
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,520
time but uh

694
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,080
so that was not something mainstream but

695
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,440
yes as the drone

696
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,280
laws grows uh mature uh these things can

697
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,679
be

698
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,919
can become mainstream so you get the

699
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,440
package in 30 minutes it

700
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,280
gets delivered in front of your house

701
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,360
and that's the concept

702
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,280
uh similarly uh that was using a

703
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,200
multi-rotor kind of a drone

704
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,640
and we will discuss what different kinds

705
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,240
of drones are there multirotors and

706
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,760
fixed-wing and whatnot

707
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
one of them for the same application

708
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,280
google is testing in

709
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,440
i guess in australia it's called project

710
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,120
wing and it's a v

711
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,520
tall uh kind of drone so vtol stands for

712
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,200
vertical takeoff and landing so these

713
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,360
kinds of drones have capability to take

714
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
off vertically and then convert into a

715
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,880
plane and then

716
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,080
do their uh do their journey and you can

717
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,799
see so

718
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,400
let me just rewind and you can see so

719
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,840
it's taking off vertically

720
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,440
and once it again some altitude it

721
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,480
converts into

722
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,760
a plane and continue the journey

723
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,080
and when it needs to land it again can

724
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,000
land vertically so that's a hybrid

725
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,480
of a multi-rotor and fixed-wing drone

726
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
which we will shortly discuss

727
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,919
in today's class so again using gps and

728
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,919
different sensors it can navigate and

729
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,840
i think it will also show how it will

730
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,760
deploy the payload so once it reaches

731
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,039
the destination

732
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,240
uh it can launch a parachute kind of

733
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,120
thing i believe

734
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,880
where the the people can

735
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,679
just take the parcel from there so yes

736
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,400
that is

737
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,840
the project wing so recently

738
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
uh the corona virus pandemic took the

739
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,240
world uh by surprise and everything

740
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,720
uh is being locked down everything uh

741
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,640
needs to be sanitized and this is a very

742
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,240
tedious task especially if you need to

743
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,840
sanitize something

744
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,799
uh uh something to get rid of the virus

745
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,120
and

746
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,200
it's in the high altitude maybe or some

747
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,159
reason where

748
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,360
humans cannot reach and maybe in in an

749
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,320
area where

750
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,720
it's very risky for people to go such

751
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,840
like these so

752
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,880
uh italy and china and france and

753
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,039
countries like this even in india uh

754
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,640
drones like this are being used to spray

755
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,159
to spray the the antiviral liquid

756
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,000
the sanitizers you you say to different

757
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,640
different parts where it's not safe for

758
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,080
humans to go

759
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,919
similarly these kinds of things are not

760
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,279
very recent in the past

761
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,279
in india i've seen a lot of different

762
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,039
people using drones for

763
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,760
spraying insecticides for irrigation of

764
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,640
crops

765
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,000
and just now recently india was under

766
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,120
the attack by

767
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,400
a swarm of locusts this uh

768
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,039
small insects which eats up the crop and

769
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,200
drones are being used to

770
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,679
to send them away so a lot of different

771
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,799
applications of drones

772
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,440
where you need to deploy some payloads

773
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,000
or you need

774
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,120
to spray something so that is there

775
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,200
now uh one application which is very

776
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
near and dear to my heart

777
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,640
is using drones in sports and this is

778
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,400
becoming more and more mainstream these

779
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,200
days so

780
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,600
here is a short video of third person

781
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,360
view of how a night drone racing looks

782
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,320
so you can see

783
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,640
these the drones are flying uh very high

784
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,400
speed with leds and are

785
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,279
passing through the gates at very high

786
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,960
speed and a lot of different drones race

787
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,080
together they

788
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,400
make multiple laps and these kinds of

789
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,320
drone sports are becoming so mainstream

790
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,080
that espn and different

791
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,880
drl drone racing leaks are coming up in

792
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,559
india we also have indian drone racing

793
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,240
league and around the world different

794
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,919
uh drone racing leagues are getting more

795
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,360
and more popular

796
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,120
comparatively this is a new sport so

797
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,400
just compare yourself if you want to

798
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,080
become a formula one pilot what kind of

799
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,840
training you need to go through

800
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,240
and uh how much money you need to invest

801
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,880
on it and

802
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,360
if you want to get into sports like this

803
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,120
like drone racing all you need is some

804
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,720
knowledge of flying drones and

805
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,480
building drones and repairing it and

806
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,840
since there is a

807
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,960
a very less learning curve compared to

808
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,880
something like formula one racing

809
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,799
uh this is uh getting more and more

810
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,880
popular and people are exploring it as a

811
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,480
as a career opportunity and a lot of

812
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,240
people are already doing

813
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,400
that uh so another thing which

814
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,480
i use drone for and a lot of people use

815
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,679
a drone for is

816
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,960
fpv freestyle video so if you if you

817
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,640
if you if you have some drones which are

818
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,039
used for aerial cinematography platform

819
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,760
like dji phantom and dji inspire then

820
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,440
those are very stable and slow drone

821
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,799
which has a gimbal and

822
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,400
those are good for for capturing

823
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,200
let's say cinematic landscape or oceans

824
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,960
or mountains but

825
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,840
there is a gap in uh in sports

826
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,600
photography and sports videography where

827
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,960
you need a drone

828
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,240
uh to capture the the bird's eye view of

829
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
sports of getting into the action but

830
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,520
you cannot go very close to it because

831
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,360
you don't have much agility and much

832
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,080
speed

833
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,159
that is the gap which is being filled by

834
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,840
the fpv drones because they can

835
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,679
fly very fast and they can get very

836
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,440
close to the action and very high speed

837
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,240
these are

838
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,760
very good for capturing something like

839
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,840
drifting of cars on race tracks so see

840
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,320
this is being captured by a drone uh by

841
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,880
a very

842
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,520
uh famous freestyle pilot uh cinematic

843
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,080
pilot

844
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,120
uh johnny fpv so uh just uh imagine

845
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,960
uh people are there in the stands and

846
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,880
these cars are drifting and

847
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,720
just imagine getting the live feed from

848
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,799
this drone into the big screen and

849
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,919
how close you are to this action so that

850
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,679
is another thing which are

851
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,840
being used and as i already mentioned

852
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,520
you can still do landscape and you can

853
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,080
do landscape

854
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,000
in a whole new dimension so look at this

855
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,520
beautiful video by beautiful

856
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,559
destinations

857
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,480
and how they are using fpv drones again

858
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,720
by the same pilot to

859
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,200
do all kind of different dimensional

860
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,880
thing which is not possible with a usual

861
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,080
drone which is not possible

862
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,880
by usual cinematic cameras but an fpv

863
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,720
drone because it's it can get very close

864
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,760
to the action

865
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,360
you're getting the live feed in your cam

866
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,880
in your camera and your goggles you're

867
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,600
flying by

868
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,919
seeing it in real time these are the

869
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,760
kinds of shots which you can take and

870
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,320
it totally blows away the mind and it is

871
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,039
totally

872
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,279
uh movie directors and producers and

873
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,120
cinematographers are exploring these

874
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,760
kinds of areas where they can use fpv

875
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
drones so

876
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,559
i'll try to share the links of this

877
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,679
video so you can check

878
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,399
in full detail so coming back so these

879
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,080
are the different applications of drones

880
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,279
and these are not just

881
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,440
the only applications of drone i am sure

882
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,480
there are

883
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,159
other thousands of application where

884
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,520
drones are being used

885
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
uh drone swamps are being used these

886
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,640
days i am sorry i missed that video so

887
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,679
in a drone swam thousands of drones uh

888
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,840
they fly together and they do some kind

889
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,279
of maneuvers there

890
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,840
where they can form some shape in the

891
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,279
night sky where they can

892
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,919
do some light painting they can post a

893
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:36,559
messages

894
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,480
drones are being used for marketing by

895
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,880
flying banners and whatnot so

896
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,039
the applications are endless and if you

897
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,080
have a flying camera

898
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
with the real-time feed you can do a lot

899
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,440
of different things so

900
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,279
i'll leave it up to you on what problem

901
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,559
you are looking to solve

902
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,640
uh using the drones and now let's talk

903
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,039
about buy versus diy

904
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,240
so this topic is uh uh

905
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,399
make people really curious because uh

906
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,159
some of you might already be thinking

907
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,120
that

908
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,559
there are a lot of different drone

909
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,720
choices available uh in the market

910
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,559
a lot of different companies uh have

911
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,080
their drones and

912
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,600
their software development get open

913
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
source uh they are uh

914
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,679
they are not very expensive they are

915
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,720
easily accessible

916
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,360
you can get them off the shelf so when

917
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,399
there are so much

918
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,679
of drones already available in the

919
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,600
market why someone should

920
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,039
make their own drone why someone should

921
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,679
diy so i'll give you a small example

922
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,120
here so i'll quickly

923
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,360
shift to the overhead camera and this is

924
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,880
the drone which i bought

925
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,080
from the market it's a dji mavic mini

926
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,159
and this drone is almost like my racing

927
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,520
drone it's very small

928
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,960
it has a camera with gimbal inbuilt and

929
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,080
it can do 30 minutes of flight time

930
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,200
so and these are the drone which i which

931
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,320
i made here

932
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,200
so this is the fpv racing drone and this

933
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,480
is the drone which i made

934
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,399
with the frame the motors i soldered

935
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,919
everything together i programmed it and

936
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,120
i fly it so

937
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,600
uh the question is why someone should

938
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,279
diy so the answer is

939
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,320
very simple so uh if your

940
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,440
application is just constrained to

941
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,760
taking aerial photos taking aerial

942
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
videos then yes you can

943
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,000
go and buy these kinds of drone they are

944
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,440
having good camera they are having

945
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,760
stabilized gimbal cameras which

946
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,520
make life much easier their software is

947
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,039
very mature

948
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,279
but if you are someone like me who have

949
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,080
a special

950
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,159
application like fpv racing high speed

951
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,159
drone flying freestyle

952
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,520
getting in from small gaps or i

953
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,159
also made autonomous drones where i

954
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:36,720
program

955
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,440
some gps coordinates where my drone go

956
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,000
and

957
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,799
deploy something especially in times of

958
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,240
disaster some

959
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,640
drones have thermal cameras to do some

960
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,399
search operation some rescue operation

961
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,200
in hills

962
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,880
if you have these kinds of application

963
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,559
then you need special

964
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,640
drones with special sensors which can do

965
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,320
something which you really wanted to do

966
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,200
which

967
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,600
drones available in the market are not

968
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,120
supposed to do so that is the only

969
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,320
reason if you have any specialized

970
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,360
application then you can consider diy

971
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,600
also one good reason to diy your drone

972
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,480
is that

973
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,240
you get to learn a lot of different

974
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,919
things you get to learn the physics of

975
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:12,960
flying object

976
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,559
you get to learn the program that

977
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,360
involved the hardware

978
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,880
soldering if you have not done soldering

979
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,000
before there is a lot of soldering

980
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,240
involved in building a drone and

981
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,919
you learn a lot of different things so

982
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,320
you learn about the optics the camera

983
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,840
the kinematics and i'm going to just

984
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,440
throw a lot of different words and these

985
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,000
are available

986
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,840
in the drone so it's a very good

987
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,200
learning platform

988
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,440
and if you build your own drone then if

989
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,039
you crash a drone because sooner or

990
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,559
later trust me you are going to crash a

991
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,039
drone because

992
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,720
when you mature as a pilot when you

993
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,159
mature your piloting skills then you

994
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,600
take more and more risk

995
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
you go closer to the object and

996
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,440
oftentimes you crash a drone so

997
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
if you have made your own drone you have

998
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,559
the ability to

999
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,480
repair it you know what inside it and

1000
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
you can replace one part you can put

1001
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,279
another part

1002
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,120
so basically if you diy your own drone

1003
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,440
you will have an experiment platform

1004
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,559
using which you can do a lot of

1005
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,480
different things and you know ins and

1006
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,760
outs of that thing and you can do

1007
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,720
whatever you wanted

1008
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,320
so that's uh take from by versus diy

1009
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,240
so this is a small graphic which i

1010
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,519
created to

1011
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,559
show the life cycle of

1012
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,640
a drone builder and a drone pilot so

1013
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,320
first of all you start by learning the

1014
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,799
physics of flying and

1015
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,159
if you signed up for this class you're

1016
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,760
in the right place and we're going to do

1017
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,360
everything in order so you learn the

1018
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,880
physics of flying and then you build

1019
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,240
your own drone

1020
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,279
so you build it from grounds up and

1021
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,360
uh so i already mentioned that building

1022
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,399
a drone is like building an

1023
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,080
experimentation platform so you can

1024
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,159
always add more and more things up to it

1025
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,080
and scale it to become more

1026
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,480
more useful so let's say you can build

1027
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,360
adjust

1028
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,919
rc drone which fly using a remote then

1029
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,120
you can add

1030
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,279
fpv camera and fp goggles into it to get

1031
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,480
a real-time feed

1032
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,840
then you can add a gps and a

1033
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,279
magnetometer and you can make it

1034
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,559
autonomous and

1035
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,399
then you can add let's say a thermal

1036
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,480
camera or a night vision camera you can

1037
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,760
fly in the night so

1038
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,679
that is the building part comes into

1039
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,679
picture and you tune your own build

1040
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,120
according to your application

1041
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,200
then you fly you know the soft uh safety

1042
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,039
norms in your area and you

1043
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,880
abide by the government legal rules and

1044
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,240
you fly

1045
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,960
and you can also practice and practicing

1046
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,720
you can do it on the simulator where you

1047
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,640
plug in your transmitter you can do real

1048
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,760
time uh

1049
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,840
practice or you just fly with fpv

1050
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,360
goggles and camera and

1051
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,440
become a better pilot with each flight

1052
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,159
and race one is optional if you want uh

1053
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:34,960
to

1054
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,679
race and looking for more fisher

1055
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,799
application but

1056
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,399
again just flying the drone and using

1057
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,840
that in the application that is the

1058
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,480
entire

1059
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,960
uh kind of life cycle of a drone builder

1060
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,440
of a drone pilot

1061
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,159
so uh let's start uh with the the

1062
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,200
definition of the unmanned aerial

1063
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,080
vehicle because

1064
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,840
when we talk about drone drones are

1065
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,279
generally the loser terms so to speak

1066
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:01,840
and

1067
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,159
the more scientific term the more

1068
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,399
technical term the more accepted term is

1069
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,119
the uavs or unmanned aerial vehicle

1070
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,520
and as the name suggests a flying

1071
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,239
vehicle

1072
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,040
which is not uh having any passenger

1073
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,679
which is not

1074
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,639
manned which is not flying by a let's

1075
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,839
say a pilot

1076
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,079
sitting in the cockpit it's called uav

1077
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,520
unmanned aerial vehicle

1078
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,599
you control it uh in from a ground

1079
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,359
station from a distance so

1080
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,440
by definition uh uav is a more

1081
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,359
scientific definition of drone

1082
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,839
meaning a flying vehicle being operated

1083
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,040
by a remote control

1084
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,960
or is capable of flying autonomously

1085
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,399
using on-board computer

1086
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,800
uh with optional feature to take input

1087
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
from ground station so a uav can take

1088
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,960
input such as the gps waypoint

1089
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,839
the throttle the yaw the pitch and all

1090
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,359
kind of things and where to deploy

1091
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,879
payloads

1092
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,839
and the uav k is also capable of sending

1093
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,918
data back to the ground station like

1094
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,640
what is its current speed uh maybe the

1095
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,480
camera feed the current altitude the

1096
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,320
current location how much battery is

1097
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,920
remaining how much flight time is

1098
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,079
remaining what is the status of mission

1099
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,320
on which the uav is being sent

1100
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,800
there is a constant debate in the drone

1101
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,599
community

1102
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,200
whether something which you are flying

1103
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,640
with the remote should be considered as

1104
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,359
a drone

1105
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,079
or only the autonomous uav should be

1106
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,680
considered as a drone

1107
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,240
for me anything which is unmanned which

1108
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,240
can fly and which can do these

1109
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,040
two things is considered as a drone but

1110
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,760
again

1111
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,800
feel free to mold this definition which

1112
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,480
suits your needs so moving ahead

1113
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,160
unmanned aerial vehicles can be

1114
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,079
categorized into a lot of different

1115
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,920
categories but here in this slide i'm

1116
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,520
going to be

1117
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960
broadly showing what are different

1118
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,040
categories you can divide

1119
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,680
uavs so number one is a fixed wing

1120
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,359
category and what i mean by the fixed

1121
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,200
wing is they have a wing

1122
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,560
a wingspan with some some shape

1123
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,440
some size which helps to make it stable

1124
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:57,680
in

1125
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,000
air the other category is called multi

1126
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,880
rotors uh

1127
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,760
which i show you over here so multi

1128
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,400
rotors

1129
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,480
is known as multirotor because these are

1130
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,720
having multiple rotors which can rotate

1131
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,280
so

1132
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,119
multiple rotors which can rotate these

1133
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,839
it's it's called multi-rotor so

1134
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,960
uh it this is a multi-rotor basic

1135
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,880
example a quadcopter because it has four

1136
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,599
motors so a quadcopter

1137
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,280
uh in the uavs you will also find some

1138
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,359
helis the remote control helis

1139
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,680
and i've seen a lot of people who also

1140
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
like to build and pilot healthy so

1141
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,320
i've also included that in this category

1142
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,720
this

1143
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,320
uh these categories can be further

1144
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,920
divided into different categories like

1145
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,880
fixed thing you get

1146
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,400
a pusher and a puller so in a pusher

1147
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,119
category fixed wing the engine or the

1148
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,560
thrust producing

1149
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,880
body is at the back and it is pushing

1150
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,240
the airplane forward

1151
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,240
it is pushing the fixed wing forward

1152
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,680
while in the puller it's in the front

1153
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,960
and it's pulling it

1154
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,839
so you can see on the left i have i've

1155
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,240
pasted a photo of a military drone it's

1156
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,720
a very common military drone where

1157
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,040
the motor is at the back and it has a

1158
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,880
wing so both of them have wings but

1159
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,079
the uh the positioning of the engine

1160
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:08,960
that defines if

1161
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,400
it's a pusher category or a polar

1162
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,040
category uh similarly in helis there are

1163
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,720
two categories called fixed pitch and

1164
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,839
collective pitch

1165
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,040
so helicopters have rotors on the top of

1166
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,880
it which allows them to hover at a

1167
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,760
particular

1168
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,040
place and if the router changes its

1169
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,920
shape it can

1170
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,839
uh change the page its collective page

1171
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,520
itself it's not it's a fixed page but we

1172
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,119
will not be talking about helis a lot so

1173
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,480
that's the only thing which

1174
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,520
is here now there is also

1175
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,280
a specialist category which is the

1176
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,560
mixture of fixed wing and the

1177
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,839
multi-rotor and it's called hybrid

1178
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,040
category and

1179
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,599
uh it's a very good example for vtol or

1180
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,280
vertical take-off and landing as i

1181
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,760
showed

1182
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,480
in a video where google project wing uh

1183
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,280
take off

1184
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,760
like a multi-rotor and it can hover at

1185
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,359
one place and then it can also be

1186
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,119
translated into a plane and it can

1187
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,000
uh take a linear motion so uh what is

1188
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,599
the basic difference which you can see

1189
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,800
uh from this category is multi-rotors

1190
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,119
uh and helicopters and vtol they can

1191
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,280
hover at one place so

1192
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,880
they can stay and they can maintain

1193
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,560
their altitude they can maintain their

1194
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,720
position at one place whereas the fixed

1195
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,280
wing

1196
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,960
will always be in a linear motion it

1197
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,119
will always be flying forward so

1198
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,720
that is the major difference between a

1199
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,320
fixed wing and a multi-rotor

1200
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,599
and we will uh see in uh in coming

1201
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,640
slides that how

1202
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,800
is these uh different kind of motions

1203
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,160
are possible and

1204
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,150
how to design uh these kinds of

1205
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,599
[Music]

1206
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,839
these kinds of thrust producing bodies

1207
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,680
so let's talk about physics of flying

1208
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,520
object and this is where the fun part

1209
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,400
starts so

1210
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,640
now we are actually going to enter into

1211
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,079
the technical details we have talked

1212
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,200
about everything

1213
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,720
non-technical now talking about the

1214
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,240
technical details

1215
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,520
uh everybody uh has uh

1216
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,400
some sort of forces acting upon it so if

1217
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,160
i take an example of this commercial

1218
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,440
airliner so

1219
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,280
the number one force which is acting on

1220
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,640
it is its own weight

1221
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,839
uh because of gravity so gravity

1222
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,839
uh exerts some sort of forces it's

1223
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,599
called gravity force and that is the

1224
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,000
force which keeps us all on the ground

1225
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,720
and in order to escape the gravity you

1226
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,280
need

1227
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,680
to have some sort of thrust so some sort

1228
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
of lift should be there which is

1229
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,760
uh enabling you to escape the gravity

1230
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,880
and flight

1231
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,599
so in case of this airliner the thrust

1232
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,640
is a

1233
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,839
parallel or sorry thirst is uh in this

1234
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:28,480
direction

1235
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,880
compared to the gravity that is why a

1236
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,119
plane needs a runway it needs to

1237
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,119
it needs to run on a runway and gain

1238
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,560
some enough

1239
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,480
kinetic energy and with the help of

1240
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,079
thrusters with the help of engines on

1241
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,160
its wing it is able to fly after some

1242
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,960
time

1243
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,760
so and these are some forces acting on

1244
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,400
it so

1245
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,520
if we talk about uh the gravitate

1246
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,800
gravity is nothing but

1247
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,720
mass time the acceleration due to

1248
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,200
gravity the weight in newtons

1249
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,440
so if the mass of this plane it's let's

1250
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,320
say 1000 tons and the gravity

1251
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,400
is let's say 9.8 then you can calculate

1252
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,599
the how much

1253
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,880
uh acceleration how much uh how much

1254
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,240
newton or forces the

1255
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,680
gravity is acting on it and it needs a

1256
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,560
more thrust to it's it enough thrust to

1257
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,240
escape that so

1258
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,400
let's talk about what happens when this

1259
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,280
body is in

1260
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,079
air or if we want to talk in a more

1261
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,359
scientific terms

1262
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,240
uh every 3d object when it comes in

1263
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,680
contact of a fluid

1264
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,160
and fluid can be air it can be liquid it

1265
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,440
can be anything

1266
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,599
which flows there are certain forces

1267
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,520
that also acts on it so

1268
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,440
one of such force is left and this is

1269
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,240
the lift which is acting in the in the

1270
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,560
perpendicular direction of this body

1271
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,839
and lift is the force which

1272
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,599
enables you to escape gravity which

1273
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,520
enables you to stay stable in this area

1274
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,040
so

1275
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,960
to escape the gravity your lift should

1276
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,640
be more than your weight and

1277
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,040
we will come and discuss to it more but

1278
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,760
if the

1279
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,079
if a 3d object is in a fluid in this

1280
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,119
case the air it

1281
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,960
is also having these components it's

1282
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,560
called the lift component

1283
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,160
and the other component is a track

1284
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,839
component which is uh

1285
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,520
completely in the opposite of direction

1286
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,599
to the thrust so we will talk about more

1287
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,520
uh about left and right in a couple of

1288
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,720
slides later

1289
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,160
now let's talk about the multi-rotor so

1290
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,680
in case of multi-rotor because the

1291
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,359
rotors are mounted on the top and the

1292
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,119
propellers are facing upwards the lift

1293
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,640
is on the top direction

1294
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,440
and let's see where the thrust is so

1295
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,119
this is the direction of this thrust and

1296
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:31,599
uh

1297
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,040
notice why i chose a very uh very

1298
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,920
unique position of angle for thrust and

1299
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,640
by this

1300
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,200
arrow of thrust i am representing that

1301
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,400
the thrust is not

1302
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,760
in a straight up direction or straight

1303
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,640
uh

1304
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,160
right direction parallel direction

1305
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,640
compared to the uh airplane

1306
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,880
that is because there is a concept

1307
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,680
called thrust

1308
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,520
vectoring which we will be talking about

1309
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,960
in a bit so

1310
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,680
multi-rotor what they do they change the

1311
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,200
rpm of the motor and

1312
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,359
according to the atom of the motor they

1313
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,119
do their motion so i'll give a very

1314
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,280
simple example so let's move to the

1315
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,480
overhead camera

1316
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,000
and uh let's let me show you what i mean

1317
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,960
by that so

1318
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,280
this is a multi-rotor which is having

1319
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,560
four motors and

1320
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,640
if all the four motors are rotating at

1321
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,839
the same speed

1322
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,680
it will lift up it will escape gravity

1323
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,599
at one point and it will stay in this

1324
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,079
air

1325
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,079
now let's say my multi rotor wants to go

1326
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,800
in this direction so what it will do

1327
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,200
it will speed up these motors and it

1328
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,040
will speed down these motors so overall

1329
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,400
thrust coming from these

1330
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,640
motors these set of motors will be more

1331
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,240
and overall thrust coming from this set

1332
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,520
of motors will be less

1333
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,040
and the multirotor will go in this

1334
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,280
direction similarly if i want to go in

1335
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,160
this direction

1336
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,880
uh the rpm produced by these motors will

1337
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,200
uh

1338
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,880
increase and the rpm produced by this

1339
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,960
motors will decrease

1340
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,720
and it will generate more thrust and i

1341
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,160
will go in this direction so

1342
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,280
that is how the thrust is

1343
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,040
change in case of multirotor and that is

1344
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,880
why i chose this very weird uh

1345
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,960
angle for thrust and we will talk about

1346
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,880
more uh about thrust vectoring in a

1347
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,920
later slide but

1348
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,960
for now just consider that

1349
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,040
the thrust coming from multirotor is not

1350
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,079
a straight up

1351
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,839
which is a misconception but it keeps on

1352
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,440
changing depending on

1353
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,400
the motion of this multirotor okay now

1354
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,240
let's uh

1355
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,520
talk about the lift and the drag in more

1356
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,720
detail so

1357
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,560
as i already mentioned that the lift is

1358
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,960
the perpendicular component of the force

1359
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,119
acting on a flying body when it passes a

1360
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,280
fluid in this case the body

1361
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,720
is the jetliner and the fluid is the air

1362
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,800
and the drag is the parallel component

1363
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,880
which is acting on this flying body

1364
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,160
and lift is a desirable component

1365
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,960
more the lift easy it would be for the

1366
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,280
body to lift up and escape gravity

1367
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,880
but the drag is a non-desirable

1368
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,400
component and it

1369
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,160
hinders the motion it hinders the

1370
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,000
forward motion for the body so if the

1371
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,880
body is moving in

1372
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,480
this direction the drag will push it

1373
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,480
back so this is nothing but

1374
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,680
uh the third newton law if so every

1375
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,680
force has equal and opposite reaction so

1376
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,720
more the body wants to move forward the

1377
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,800
drag would come into the picture and

1378
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,760
hindering that

1379
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,800
particular uh rectilinear motion

1380
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,720
in the case of drone again the drag is

1381
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,920
the

1382
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,880
parallel component the lift is the

1383
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,119
perpendicular component and

1384
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,520
the objective is same for every flying

1385
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,240
object

1386
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,880
we need to maximize the lift the more

1387
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,560
the lift the better it is for for the

1388
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,480
flying body to keep in air the better

1389
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,960
stability it will get and minimize the

1390
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,680
drag

1391
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,560
the minimum the drag uh acting on a body

1392
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,520
the more

1393
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,599
desirable effect it has it would be more

1394
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,520
stable and the more the track the more

1395
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,520
unstable the body will be in the fluid

1396
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,319
and again the fluid here is air

1397
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,720
so i am going to be talking about a very

1398
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,920
powerful concept

1399
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,800
about her about the lift and that is the

1400
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,599
thrust is to weight ratio so

1401
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,160
uh every body which needs to escape the

1402
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,160
gravity should have a thrust is to

1403
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:02,880
weight ratio

1404
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,119
more than one so what i mean by that so

1405
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,520
let's say a weight of the body is one kg

1406
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,079
so

1407
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,880
it should produce more than one kg or

1408
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,720
more than one newton of thrust to be

1409
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,560
able to escape the gravity

1410
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,119
and if you talk about these drones which

1411
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:17,680
i have

1412
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,079
which i have made so these drones have a

1413
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,040
weight around

1414
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,640
1 kg and each motor at full rpm is

1415
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,880
capable of producing let's say 2 kgs of

1416
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,920
thrust so

1417
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,200
2 into 8 is 8 kgs of thrust

1418
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,960
two into four is eight kgs of thrust so

1419
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,960
one kg is the weight of this drone and

1420
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,440
eight kilogram of thrust it can produce

1421
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,280
so the thrust is to weight ratio of this

1422
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,359
particular tone is eight is to one which

1423
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,480
is very high

1424
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,560
uh and generally speaking a two is to

1425
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,240
one is the

1426
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,359
minimum ratio which is uh expected by a

1427
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:50,720
body to keep uh

1428
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,079
in the air stability so

1429
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,880
i can i can add more powerful motors and

1430
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,920
the overall

1431
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,359
thrust which i can generate with them

1432
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,920
can be let's say uh 10 kilogram and the

1433
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,280
weight of this drone is fixed one

1434
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,280
kilogram so i will be having a 10 is to

1435
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:05,760
one

1436
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,640
thrust to weight ratio so uh more the

1437
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,000
thrust is to weight ratio

1438
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,880
better the body will be stable more lift

1439
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,400
it will produce and

1440
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,079
thrust producing engines or electric

1441
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,319
these all depends on different things

1442
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,680
which will be talking about

1443
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,720
in the motor uh chapter uh

1444
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,920
the second thing which you can do is

1445
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,599
reduce the drag as i mentioned in the

1446
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,760
objective is minimize the drag and

1447
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,920
to minimize the drag we first need to

1448
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,760
learn on what different factors the

1449
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,480
track depends on so drag depends on two

1450
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,400
factors number one is the shape of this

1451
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,240
object and number two

1452
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,280
the viscous force between the fluid and

1453
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,839
the body

1454
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,240
so we all know about viscosity that is

1455
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,200
the force of

1456
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,880
viscous force in the fluid so

1457
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,880
technically speaking we cannot control

1458
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,720
the viscous force between the fluid and

1459
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,400
the body because that is out of our

1460
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,440
control

1461
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,920
we may be able to control it by changing

1462
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,040
the material

1463
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,200
using this body but again what are

1464
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,480
different choices we have when we are

1465
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,680
making an airplane we

1466
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,880
are using uh aero grade aluminum

1467
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,880
and some alloys because that is the only

1468
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,400
option that a lightweight that

1469
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,560
is dense and that is suitable for making

1470
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,599
planes so

1471
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,240
uh technically speaking we cannot change

1472
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,000
the friction between the fluid and the

1473
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,960
body so what

1474
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,119
is the other thing that is remaining

1475
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:24,640
which we can use to minimize the track

1476
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,119
that is the shape of this object and

1477
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,200
trust me when i say we use shape of this

1478
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,280
object by minimize to minimize the track

1479
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,480
and it is happening

1480
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,960
everywhere everywhere you see it's so

1481
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,079
intuitive

1482
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,359
it is so uh programmed into the brains

1483
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,040
of human being that they're using

1484
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,440
uh it everywhere and every invention

1485
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,160
they do in

1486
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,280
everything to do in fact uh we do this

1487
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,800
so intuitively that we also do not

1488
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,640
realize so i'll show you some with some

1489
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,640
examples so

1490
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,760
if you if you look closely to the wing

1491
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,000
of

1492
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
any airplane you will see this kind of

1493
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,520
shape and this kind of shape is known as

1494
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,480
airfoil

1495
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,839
so the the idea behind having the

1496
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,240
wing shaped in such a way is to reduce

1497
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,119
the drag

1498
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,680
so you can see this is some sort of

1499
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,599
teardrop kind of shape and this is very

1500
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,400
efficient

1501
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,520
shape when it comes to reduced drag and

1502
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,440
these kinds of thick reduce drag and

1503
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,200
give some lift to the subject making it

1504
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,440
more stable in this air and

1505
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,839
depending on the application we use

1506
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,920
different kind of airfoil we have ks

1507
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,200
airfoil we have

1508
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,119
all kind of airfoil available depending

1509
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,640
on the application and what kind of

1510
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,000
plane we have

1511
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,640
we use airfoil so this is a very good

1512
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,800
diagram so you can see we have a disc we

1513
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,119
have a sphere and we have a teardrop and

1514
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,319
you can see

1515
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,240
how the the fluid is uh

1516
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,960
is going across the body and you can see

1517
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,119
the small droplets everywhere so

1518
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,000
this is the least hair the teardrop

1519
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,040
structure and

1520
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,720
that is why the teardrop structure is

1521
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,480
one of the structure which has the least

1522
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,800
drag so when all these three bodies are

1523
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,800
passing through the liquid you can see

1524
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,000
passing through the fluid you can see

1525
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,400
that teardrop is having the least drag

1526
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,760
and again this kind of thing is very

1527
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,680
common to see in the nature

1528
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,880
and this is a diagram by

1529
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,359
nasa and you can see the winglets uh

1530
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:18,880
winglets are something at the

1531
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,240
edge of the uh the airplane

1532
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,480
wing and you can see it's tilted upwards

1533
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,160
and it created

1534
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,119
some sort of air vortex and winglet

1535
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,599
reduces the induced drag component so

1536
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,280
again a lot of different places where

1537
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,880
you can see uh

1538
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,559
the application of changing shape to

1539
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,800
reduce drag one such is

1540
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,680
the the body of sports car so you can

1541
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,599
see they are shaped in such a way that

1542
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,280
it cuts the fluid in such a way that the

1543
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,960
drag is reduced

1544
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,119
and i also told you that it is very

1545
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,040
intuitively programmed in our

1546
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,599
in our mind so you can see when we swim

1547
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,720
and if

1548
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,280
we try to we tend to keep our feet so

1549
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,400
parallel to the

1550
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,559
to the to the water surface and that is

1551
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:01,599
why we

1552
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,520
we do that because we want less dry

1553
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,280
acting on it compared to the

1554
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,240
the second picture and this is a very

1555
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,520
good example of

1556
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,960
the fastest animal on this earth it's

1557
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,079
a falcon the alpha predator

1558
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,119
and uh when a falcon dive i believe it

1559
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,200
can dive at a speed of 200 kilometers

1560
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,920
per hour

1561
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,160
and this is the timing shape of a falcon

1562
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,000
it it

1563
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,920
creates this shape using its wings and

1564
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,000
this body and it helps to dive very fast

1565
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,559
because

1566
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,400
the drag is reduced so you can see that

1567
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:34,960
uh

1568
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,359
it's so intuitive and it's in nature

1569
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,280
it's in engineering it's everywhere in

1570
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,040
our mind that

1571
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,520
because we are constantly in contact

1572
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,240
with fluid in contact of air that is why

1573
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,119
we need to keep in mind what a shape

1574
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,160
helps reduce this

1575
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,480
drag so let's talk about

1576
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,960
degree of freedom okay so let's continue

1577
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,559
with the physics of flying object and

1578
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,160
now let's talk about degree of freedom

1579
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,559
so

1580
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,800
every flying object when it's in air it

1581
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,040
has a certain degree of freedom

1582
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,559
and by degree of freedom i mean the

1583
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,200
accesses on which it moves so

1584
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,680
generally speaking in a 3d space you

1585
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,319
have a roll pitch and your accessor

1586
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,480
the role is on x axis the pitch is on

1587
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,280
y-axis and the yaw is on z-axis so

1588
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,800
if you take an example of this drone so

1589
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,520
this is the role access its role degree

1590
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,240
of freedom

1591
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,319
this is the pitch access its pitch

1592
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,599
degree of freedom

1593
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,839
and this is the yo axis it's your degree

1594
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:32,720
of freedom

1595
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,400
other than this if you want to control

1596
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,319
the height you need to control the

1597
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,559
thrust and the thrust produced from the

1598
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:39,520
motors

1599
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,559
and similarly in case

1600
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,839
of an airplane you have the role access

1601
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,839
the pitch axis and

1602
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,119
the your access

1603
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,720
if you want to control the altitude you

1604
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,640
want to control the speed then you need

1605
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,720
to control the thrusters you need to

1606
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,839
control the engines

1607
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,119
uh producing the energy so

1608
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,240
now the question is how uh these bodies

1609
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,079
these flying bodies such as the drones

1610
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,200
or airplanes these

1611
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,000
control uh this degree of freedom so if

1612
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,079
you talk about uh

1613
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,240
uh controlling the yaw pigeon roll axis

1614
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,760
it is done in

1615
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,400
certain ways depending on the body so if

1616
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,800
a body is aerodynamically stable it can

1617
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,240
use a control surface

1618
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,640
it is if a body is aerodynamically

1619
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,319
unstable and i'll come to that what is

1620
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,079
aerodynamically unstable

1621
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,440
it can use something called thrust

1622
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,319
vectoring or using an on board computers

1623
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,040
and sensors

1624
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,240
so let's first talk about

1625
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,240
aerodynamically stable so

1626
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,119
consider uh a passenger jetliner

1627
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,760
airplane such as boeing 747 or airbus

1628
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,960
a320

1629
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,440
uh the application of such airplane is

1630
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,200
to carry passenger and

1631
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,480
to be more efficient on fuel uh to

1632
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,680
to be more stable because the passengers

1633
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,680
wants to enjoy a stable flight they want

1634
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,599
to enjoy a peaceful flight with

1635
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,119
which with less turbulent or uh have a

1636
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:03,680
piece

1637
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,920
in the cabin so that is an example of

1638
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,680
aerodynamically a stable

1639
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,119
uh 3d body now let's uh let's see if

1640
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:11,440
that

1641
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,599
is also true for something like a

1642
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,559
fighter jet so

1643
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,280
do you want a fighter jet uh pilot to

1644
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,079
have a

1645
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,640
good experience to have a smooth

1646
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,680
soothing flight

1647
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,440
if that is the case then they would be

1648
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,680
shot down by an enemy aircraft so that

1649
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,480
is why

1650
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,079
in case of fighter jet you need very

1651
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,760
fast maneuvering you need to

1652
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,079
have something a capability where you

1653
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:32,880
can

1654
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,119
quickly uh escape a missile attack or

1655
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,559
enemy machine guns or whatever so

1656
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,319
therefore you don't need a good

1657
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,559
stability you need to be unstable so you

1658
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,119
can do

1659
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,920
some quick maneuver so that is why uh a

1660
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,319
jet

1661
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,040
by design a fighter jet by design uh is

1662
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,880
aerodynamically unstable

1663
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,800
and uh because of aerodynamically

1664
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,319
unstable it use

1665
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,079
dart for its advantage to make quick

1666
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,480
maneuvers on the other hand a jetliner

1667
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,480
like airbus a320 or a380 they are

1668
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,079
aerodynamically stable

1669
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,119
uh they are a wing structure their

1670
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,960
dihedral which is the angle on which

1671
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,880
wings are bent their airfoil

1672
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,880
all is designed to keep stability in

1673
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,920
mind and

1674
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,520
that is why they are able to do a very

1675
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,520
smooth uh landing a very smooth flight

1676
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,440
and even if the engines are fail they

1677
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,720
can soar at

1678
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,800
uh to some distances so to some

1679
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,400
kilometers they can

1680
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,280
however not however they can keep stable

1681
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:31,920
and they can

1682
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,040
fly for some uh distance without engine

1683
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,119
whereas in in case of drones or in case

1684
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,760
of jet they are aerodynamically unstable

1685
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,839
there is no airfoil here there is

1686
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:42,880
nothing which is

1687
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,720
keeping this body uh stable in this air

1688
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,000
everything is done with the help of

1689
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,520
onboard computer and we'll talk about

1690
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,680
that similarly in case of jets

1691
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,720
they move using thrust vectoring so now

1692
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,640
let's talk about how they move

1693
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,240
so in case of the commercial airliners

1694
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,520
they have something called

1695
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,960
control surfaces so they have ailerons

1696
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,960
they have rudders they have elevators so

1697
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,400
consider it

1698
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,839
this is a an airplane my hand and

1699
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,280
i'm going in the straight direction and

1700
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,240
if i want to ascend the altitude

1701
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,240
i will use my elevator so elevator will

1702
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,000
go up now what will happen

1703
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,079
the air was moving in in this direction

1704
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,119
now air will hit

1705
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,680
this on my tail the elevator and air

1706
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,559
will push it

1707
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,880
down and if this push it down i will go

1708
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,319
up ascending so that

1709
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,160
is how the control surfaces work

1710
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,160
similarly consider this the rudder so

1711
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,079
now it is straight i'm going straight

1712
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,520
now i want to go right

1713
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,440
i will move the rudder right so air will

1714
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,960
push it in this direction

1715
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,839
and now i will uh do a right turn so

1716
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,400
rudder is used to control the yaw

1717
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,880
the ailerons they worked in pair if

1718
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,160
right aileron goes up

1719
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,640
left aileron goes down the wind pushes

1720
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,240
the right one from the tub

1721
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,480
from the up the wind pushes the left

1722
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,400
hand from the down and it will do a roll

1723
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,040
right similarly for roll left uh the

1724
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,359
opposite so rudder is used to control

1725
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,880
the your degree of freedom

1726
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,559
ailerons are used to control the role

1727
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,079
degree of freedom

1728
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,480
elevator is used to control the pitch

1729
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,760
degree of freedom

1730
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,559
similarly in case of jet jet also has

1731
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:15,200
all three

1732
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,440
these uh ailerons runners and elevators

1733
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,240
and more

1734
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,559
apart from that a jet also has something

1735
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,400
called thrust vectoring so what it can

1736
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:22,960
do

1737
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,480
as you can see on the right hand side

1738
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,079
there is a jet engine

1739
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,799
and jet engine can change the direction

1740
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,119
up and down and the overall

1741
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,119
axis on which the thrust is generating

1742
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,160
it changes

1743
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,319
and this is called thrust vectoring

1744
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:37,440
where you change the

1745
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,760
uh axis on which the thrust is acting so

1746
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,799
in a jet it is

1747
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,440
done by thrust vectoring of engine in

1748
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,720
case of drone

1749
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,280
it is done by an onboard computer where

1750
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,119
then onboard computer what it will do it

1751
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,480
will command

1752
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,640
some some motors to spin at a different

1753
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,319
rpm and some motor to spin at different

1754
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:55,440
rpm so

1755
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,559
if we want to do let's say pitch down

1756
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,480
what the computer will do computer will

1757
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,079
spin the back motor

1758
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,400
at higher rpm and the front motor at

1759
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,520
lower rpm

1760
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,520
and the overall rpm will be more from

1761
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,640
the back and it will pitch

1762
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,200
down similarly if i wanted to roll right

1763
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,880
the left two motors will spin up

1764
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,559
the right two motors will speed down and

1765
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:15,920
it will do roll right

1766
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,880
and how much rpm to give to each motor

1767
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,240
is calculated by

1768
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,640
a flight controller and that is where

1769
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,520
the computer comes into the picture so

1770
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,160
you can see uh this is a quadcopter we

1771
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,359
have a

1772
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,079
two green motor uh rotating clockwise

1773
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,200
two blue motors

1774
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,599
diagonally rotating anti-clockwise so

1775
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,359
they cancel each other thrust

1776
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,920
and the overall thrust is in the up axis

1777
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:40,880
so it will move

1778
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,599
it will hover up but if you want to do

1779
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:44,720
any roll your

1780
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,880
uh or pitch then you need to speed some

1781
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,640
motors up and some motors down

1782
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,640
and that's how you do roll flip rotation

1783
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,920
and up and down

1784
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,280
so uh uav multi-rotors are

1785
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,799
aerodynamically unstable

1786
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,799
they don't have any airfoil they don't

1787
00:57:58,799 --> 00:57:59,839
have anything

1788
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,079
which is helping to generate lift to

1789
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,520
increase lift

1790
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,280
so they require a computer connected to

1791
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,359
the sensors and they use mathematical

1792
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,079
algorithms to to have a stable flight to

1793
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,160
hover at one place or to do roll

1794
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,720
right or roll left or your pitch or

1795
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,400
anything

1796
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,000
so that is why sensors comes into the

1797
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,720
picture and accelerometers and gyroscope

1798
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,520
and

1799
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,680
how much rpm each motor should be

1800
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,680
spinning at a particular time and that

1801
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,119
is what we will be learning in this

1802
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:27,760
course

1803
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,400
uh in future chapters uh how the

1804
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,400
mathematics algorithm the digital signal

1805
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,200
processing

1806
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,079
and the control systems work together to

1807
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,040
to make this

1808
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,720
uav multi-rotors fly and that is why

1809
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,400
without sensors without an onboard

1810
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,400
computer you cannot fly a drone

1811
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,920
and if there are some people who are

1812
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,079
thinking they can control the drone

1813
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,480
with their remote without any computer

1814
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,280
sensor

1815
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,520
uh please don't try that home uh because

1816
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,040
that's not what

1817
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,839
uh is supposed to uh fly a multirotor

1818
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,319
so one thing uh i want you to do is from

1819
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:03,040
now on

1820
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,960
whenever i say drone i want you to

1821
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,319
picture this uh

1822
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,200
this quadcopter with four motors uh two

1823
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:09,680
of them

1824
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,520
uh rotating clockwise two of them

1825
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,359
rotating anti-clockwise because

1826
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,760
if you keep saying uavs and drones and

1827
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,440
you keep imagining uh

1828
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,440
the airplanes and helicopters and

1829
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,720
whatnot will become very

1830
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,640
difficult for us to be on the same page

1831
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,000
so uh

1832
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,319
from now on whenever i say drone i want

1833
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,920
you to picture this quadcopter

1834
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,280
and we will be good to go so moving to

1835
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,319
the next uh

1836
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,520
uh next part of this class is we need to

1837
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,880
discuss different components of the

1838
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,280
drone and every component is important

1839
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,839
every component has their own chapter so

1840
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:42,480
in this

1841
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,079
small section i'm just going to show you

1842
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,680
all the components so you have a small

1843
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,079
picture

1844
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:47,680
in your mind that what all things goes

1845
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,359
inside making a drone

1846
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:53,280
so first and foremost is the very uh

1847
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,359
important components of frame of this

1848
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,400
drone which

1849
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,960
house the entire assembly then we have

1850
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,400
the motors and

1851
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,040
if you can see here so these are the

1852
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,480
motors here

1853
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,720
uh in the quadcopter which i told you to

1854
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,960
imagine we have four motors because quad

1855
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,760
means four and this is inside of this

1856
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,599
motor but we will talk more about it in

1857
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:14,000
the motor

1858
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,040
section in the motor chapter uh then we

1859
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,640
have the propeller here as you can see

1860
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,920
these are the propellers

1861
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,359
these are the propellers comes in

1862
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,200
different shapes and sizes and

1863
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,720
today is the day of propeller which

1864
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,119
we'll be discussing a lot

1865
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,640
uh then we have electronic speed

1866
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,559
controller uh here my electronic speed

1867
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,160
controllers are behind this

1868
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,319
electrical tape so you cannot see but

1869
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,839
i'll make sure to show you

1870
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,000
in the esc chapter then we have

1871
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,440
something called power distribution

1872
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,599
board because we have four motors and we

1873
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,040
only have one battery

1874
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,440
so to distribute the power and to

1875
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,799
because there are some other components

1876
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,559
which require a different voltage

1877
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,720
than this motor so to distribute the

1878
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,799
power to get correct voltage we have

1879
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,040
a power distribution board right at the

1880
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,960
center uh which we will also be

1881
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,720
discussing in future chapters

1882
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,440
then we have the brain of the drone that

1883
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,240
is

1884
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,720
the flight controller right here this

1885
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,280
brain

1886
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,000
carries some sensors and some cpu and do

1887
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,799
all kind of computation

1888
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,839
then we have a battery so i have

1889
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:17,119
no battery there but here is a battery

1890
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,400
so this is excuse me a lithium polymer

1891
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,200
battery

1892
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,400
and a very risky thing if not

1893
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,400
used correctly so we will be talking

1894
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,920
about that and its hazards in the

1895
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,760
battery chapter and how to charge it and

1896
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,559
not

1897
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,160
uh then we have the transmitters and

1898
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,400
receiver so receiver goes inside the

1899
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:34,799
drone

1900
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,200
transmitter stays inside uh transmitter

1901
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,799
stays with the pilot

1902
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:41,359
and on the pilot hand so that's how you

1903
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:42,960
control the drone you give command to

1904
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,160
the drone

1905
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,400
in case of autonomous drones where you

1906
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,160
don't pilot the drone yourself

1907
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,640
you need a computer and you also need a

1908
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,680
receiver to send

1909
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,119
data to the drone such as gps or

1910
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,400
altitude data or whatever

1911
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,240
then we have fpv transmission system

1912
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,880
where we have a small fpv camera

1913
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,839
if you can see right here this is a

1914
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:06,319
small

1915
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,760
fpv camera which sends the live feed

1916
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,319
to something uh like this it's a video

1917
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:14,160
transmitter if you can see

1918
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,400
so this video transmitter sends uh take

1919
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,160
signal from this camera and send to

1920
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,319
a ground station receiver and this is

1921
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,079
the antenna that is being used for

1922
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:23,280
transmission it's

1923
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,119
it's called circular polarized antenna

1924
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:27,359
and a good piece of technology right

1925
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:28,559
here we'll talk about that

1926
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,079
in fpv chapters uh then there are some

1927
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,119
miscellaneous

1928
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,039
some optional stuff as you can see so

1929
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,640
you have a telemetry radio

1930
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,400
to check your drone current speed

1931
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,160
current consumption a current

1932
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,200
battery voltage you have a gps receiver

1933
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,760
to know the drone current uh latitude

1934
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,799
and longitude

1935
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,839
then you have excuse me

1936
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,640
a gopro or hd camera with a gimbal if

1937
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,680
you want some nice

1938
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,160
recording you have a goggles or a screen

1939
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,000
where you can see the live

1940
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,640
video feed coming from the drone and

1941
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,839
what's this this is something very

1942
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:02,960
interesting so

1943
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,960
uh this is a race transponder and it's

1944
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,200
used in fpv drone racing so what we do

1945
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:07,520
we

1946
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,119
mount a small uh small transponders on

1947
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,000
our drone

1948
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,440
and when the drone fly at a very high

1949
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,480
speed from a gate

1950
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,119
from the entry the first gate there is a

1951
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,200
receiver there the ir receiver which

1952
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,359
locks the flight uh sorry which locks

1953
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,280
the lap time of the drone and

1954
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,720
this is the transponder which is being

1955
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,240
used for that purpose

1956
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,359
now the star of for today's class is the

1957
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:34,160
propeller

1958
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,640
and uh this is what we are going to

1959
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,559
discuss in grade it is today

1960
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,520
so propeller is the cheapest part of the

1961
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,920
drone while the other things cost

1962
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,280
hundreds of dollars

1963
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,280
you can buy a set of propeller for as

1964
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,400
low as

1965
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,240
three dollars so this is the cheapest

1966
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,160
part but again in my opinion the most

1967
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,280
important part

1968
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,599
and this is the first component in my

1969
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,200
opinion which you should choose

1970
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,520
because this is a component which will

1971
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,839
be the deciding factor for your frame

1972
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:05,280
and why is that to explain that let's go

1973
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,880
to the overhead camera

1974
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,520
so uh the application of my drone is to

1975
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,480
lift something

1976
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,880
is to carry something so in my case i

1977
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,520
want my

1978
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,079
drone to carry a fpv camera and i want

1979
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,880
my drone to let's say carry an hd camera

1980
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,640
in your case it could be you want your

1981
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,400
drone to carry

1982
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,799
let's say a pesticide spray or a

1983
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,160
sanitizer spray

1984
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,640
so you need to calculate how much weight

1985
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,880
your drone should be having at the

1986
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,799
uh before flight so it's called all up

1987
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,079
fit or auv

1988
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,839
so if i if i have an all up wait for 1

1989
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:41,680
kg with the mathematics of

1990
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,440
the thrust distributed ratio i need at

1991
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,520
least 2 kg of thrust to make this drone

1992
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,039
stable in the flight

1993
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:48,960
and where is the thrust coming from

1994
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,359
trust is coming from the combinations of

1995
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:54,559
motors and propellers so let's say

1996
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,240
i have decided my application i have

1997
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,680
decided that my drone

1998
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,599
uh would need to carry this camera and

1999
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,359
the overall weight including everything

2000
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:02,319
batteries and that

2001
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:06,160
camera would be 1 kg so i need at least

2002
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,920
2 kgs of thrust

2003
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,160
for this drone and i also know that i

2004
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,920
want my drone to be this small and not

2005
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,480
very big

2006
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,599
so what is the deciding factor now

2007
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,000
so i need at least 2 kgs of thrust so i

2008
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,039
need a motor which can generate at least

2009
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,200
one by fourth of 2kg or let's say half

2010
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,240
kg of thrust

2011
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,920
so i want one of my motor to generate

2012
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,280
half kg of thrust

2013
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,280
and i have this limitation this is my

2014
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,640
limitation this

2015
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,079
this size so i cannot fit

2016
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:35,920
this propeller here because this

2017
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,440
propeller might be able to generate half

2018
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,559
kg of thrust

2019
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,720
but there is not much clearance here if

2020
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,720
my propeller rotates it will

2021
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,440
uh obstruct by the frame so that is the

2022
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,960
limitation i'm playing with here i

2023
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,599
cannot

2024
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,000
uh put a 10 inch propeller here so all i

2025
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,359
can do is put

2026
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,559
at least minimum of

2027
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,240
5 inch propeller here and not more than

2028
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,079
that so that is where the

2029
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,599
propellers comes into the picture and

2030
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:01,200
that is why it's

2031
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,119
one of the most important component

2032
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,960
because propeller tells you

2033
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,760
uh to what kind of thrust you are

2034
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,880
looking for and what

2035
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,160
is the size which you can go for the

2036
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,640
propeller

2037
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,559
so while choosing a propeller there are

2038
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:17,839
a lot of different things that comes

2039
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:19,680
into the picture and the first

2040
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,680
deciding factor is material and the

2041
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,520
power delivery source so

2042
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,960
uh speaking uh generally there are two

2043
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,480
uh common material for propellers one is

2044
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,200
the wood propeller and they are used for

2045
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,319
gas based

2046
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,119
uavs or engine based uavs where you use

2047
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,359
some gasoline or some gas

2048
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,240
some some sort of fuel to power your

2049
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,039
uavs

2050
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:44,720
the plastic propellers are used for

2051
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,079
electric uavs where you

2052
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,760
are using some electric motors to

2053
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,280
generate thrust

2054
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,119
because the wood has more density the

2055
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,760
wood as uh

2056
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,640
the wood is more let's say solid that is

2057
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,359
why

2058
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,280
it is more suitable for electric base

2059
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,119
sorry that is why it's more suitable for

2060
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,280
gas base because when a gas engine

2061
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,640
generate thrust that is

2062
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,920
not easy for plastic polymers to control

2063
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,359
it that is why what propellers are used

2064
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:09,920
there

2065
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,599
in case of electric plastic is a good

2066
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,240
choice and if i say plastic i mean

2067
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,799
the different polymers of plastic so it

2068
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,200
can be

2069
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,680
sorry it can be glass nylon it can be

2070
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,200
polycarbonate

2071
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,160
so polycarbonate propellers are very

2072
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,760
common in drones such as these

2073
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,720
the second thing which uh you have to

2074
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,920
look for propeller is a direction of

2075
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,880
rotation so

2076
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,440
if you remember i showed the photo of a

2077
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,359
quadcopter and i told you that

2078
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,119
two of the motor spin clockwise and two

2079
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,119
of the motor spin anti-clockwise

2080
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,240
but the overall thrust is upwards that

2081
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,599
is why the

2082
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,680
the propeller and the motor generate

2083
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,520
thrust downwards and as a result

2084
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,880
the the drone goes up by newton third

2085
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,520
laws of motion that is why the thrust is

2086
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,680
uh generated at the downside even with

2087
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,960
the rocket the thrust is generated

2088
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,720
downside and the body moves up

2089
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,839
by the third law of motion so uh if

2090
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:08,160
uh two motors are spinning clockwise and

2091
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,079
two motors spinning anti-clockwise but

2092
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:11,920
to keep the direction of thrust in one

2093
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,720
direction

2094
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,240
uh the shape of the propellers needs to

2095
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,080
be different so that is why

2096
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,839
there are clockwise propellers and there

2097
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:19,600
are anti-clockwise propellers if you

2098
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,759
look at the overhead cam

2099
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:24,080
so you can see there are two different

2100
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,560
shape of this propeller two different uh

2101
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,560
uh angle of the blade so this is a

2102
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,759
clockwise propeller

2103
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,279
uh it spins clockwise uh this way and

2104
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,040
this is an anti-clockwise spin

2105
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,399
anti-clockwise so

2106
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,000
the motor and the propeller spins this

2107
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,439
way and the overall thrust

2108
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,839
on the downwards and it uh helps pushes

2109
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,839
the drone up

2110
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:46,479
so uh this is another category of

2111
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:47,040
propeller's

2112
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,600
direction so in a in a quadcopter in a

2113
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,719
drone uh

2114
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,640
again when i say drone please uh think

2115
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,839
about quadcopter

2116
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:56,399
you need uh two clockwise propellers so

2117
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,560
here i have two clockwise propellers and

2118
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,198
you have two

2119
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:00,960
anti-clockwise propellers so you cannot

2120
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,960
just keep one propeller in every drone

2121
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,439
so

2122
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,040
keep that in mind the other thing here

2123
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,640
is the number of blades so as you can

2124
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,719
see in this drone i have a three bladed

2125
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:11,439
propeller

2126
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,839
in this drone which i bought off the

2127
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:14,799
shelf we have

2128
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:17,120
two bladed propellers so why is that why

2129
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,719
we have different number of blades and

2130
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,399
on the screen you can see something with

2131
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,359
the

2132
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,799
six blades so uh this is because of the

2133
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:27,839
different in application so here is a

2134
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,359
simple rule so

2135
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,158
more the number of blades more easy it

2136
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:34,000
is for you to control the

2137
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,120
drone more easy it is more

2138
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,479
control you have on your drone if you

2139
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:40,158
are flying with the remote

2140
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:42,719
but because more blades means more

2141
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,479
surface area it will consume more

2142
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:45,359
current so that

2143
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,399
is a simple mathematics here so

2144
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:50,399
generally speaking for fpv drone racing

2145
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,399
a three bladed propeller seems like an

2146
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,600
appropriate choice

2147
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,080
a three blade propeller give you enough

2148
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,920
handling give you enough control that

2149
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:58,640
you

2150
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,040
can maneuver your drone at sharp turns

2151
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,120
at very high speed

2152
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,000
and also it not consume lot of current

2153
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
as compared to six bit propeller

2154
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,800
but uh two blade propellers consume less

2155
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,360
current

2156
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,679
it will give you more flight time but it

2157
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,120
will not give you much control so you

2158
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,719
need to find a sweet spot

2159
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,320
and talking about the sweet spot i'm

2160
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,080
going to tell you one thing which

2161
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,800
stands true for everything in drone and

2162
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,440
that is

2163
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,159
trade-off so in drone everything is

2164
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:26,880
trade-off

2165
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,560
you gain one thing you will lose a

2166
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,000
couple of more things so you need to

2167
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,280
find a sweet spot

2168
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,440
in case of propeller number of blade

2169
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,520
equal to three is a sweet spot which

2170
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,199
which don't consume much current like

2171
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,280
six blade propeller but which will give

2172
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:39,679
you

2173
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:40,960
more control compared to two blood

2174
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,560
propeller so a three blade propeller for

2175
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,400
fpv drone racing

2176
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,480
and fpv freestyle is a very sweet spot

2177
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:49,199
which people have found

2178
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,280
now let's talk about propeller sizes so

2179
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,960
talking about the propellers propeller

2180
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,280
comes in all shapes and sizes so this is

2181
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,159
a five inch propeller here this is a

2182
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:01,520
10-inch propeller here as you can see so

2183
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,440
apart from that you also see that they

2184
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,880
have certain degree

2185
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,120
of angle on each side so there are

2186
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,560
certain angle of attack

2187
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,800
let's say here and certain angle here so

2188
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,640
what are these so it's called pitch

2189
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,360
so a propeller has a two different uh

2190
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,679
uh numbers associated with it it's a

2191
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,600
length and it's called a pitch

2192
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,360
a length of propeller is straightforward

2193
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,280
it's the length in inches so

2194
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,520
a 10 inch propeller is 10 inches long a

2195
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,760
5 inch propeller is 5 inches long and

2196
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,159
it is important because if your frame is

2197
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:33,120
small uh

2198
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,719
it can only accommodate let's say 5 inch

2199
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,000
propeller you cannot use 10 inch

2200
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,120
propeller so that is quite

2201
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,400
straightforward

2202
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,880
more the length more thrust it will

2203
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,080
produce because there will be more

2204
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,040
surface area

2205
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,760
more air will be cut and more the length

2206
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,120
more thrust will be produced

2207
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,120
more current will be consumed simple and

2208
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,960
straightforward calculation

2209
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,960
talking about the pitch pitch is

2210
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,239
something as you can see in the right

2211
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:55,120
diagram is

2212
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,600
how much distance the body travel in one

2213
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,480
rotation

2214
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,719
so if your propeller has a pitch of

2215
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,560
eight it will travel eight inches in one

2216
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,199
rotation

2217
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:05,920
if it having four it will travel four

2218
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,280
inches in one

2219
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,280
full revolution so that is a simple

2220
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,560
match and uh

2221
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,199
we do not care about how much it travels

2222
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,120
in one revolution but we

2223
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,199
do care about how the pitch affects the

2224
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,960
thrust so more the pitch more thrust you

2225
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:19,360
will get

2226
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,640
more current it will consume so when you

2227
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,239
are buying a propeller and if i go to

2228
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,280
the overhead cam

2229
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,800
so here you will see that a propeller

2230
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,360
has

2231
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,120
some markings on it i am not sure if you

2232
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,880
are able to see but it says

2233
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,000
10 into 4 cross 5. so a 10

2234
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,560
into 4 cross 5 means the propeller is 10

2235
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,199
inches

2236
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:42,239
long and having a pitch of 4.5 inches so

2237
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,760
in propeller everything is in

2238
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,800
inches similarly

2239
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,400
some propellers have different markings

2240
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,960
so this is having a marking of five zero

2241
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:51,280
four

2242
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,280
five so there are two different kinds of

2243
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,719
marking which is accepted when

2244
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:57,120
uh buying a propeller it's either uh

2245
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,320
it's let's say

2246
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,480
uh in the pp in the presentation you can

2247
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,679
see one

2248
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,159
is five into four cross five or the

2249
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:04,800
other is

2250
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,320
five zero four five so both are

2251
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,880
acceptable both means five inches length

2252
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,800
and four point five inches of pitch

2253
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,960
so generally speaking as a rule of thumb

2254
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,480
for uh fpv

2255
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:18,159
mini quads fpv drone racing uh five

2256
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,679
four to six inches propeller is

2257
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:21,360
something you are looking for and pitch

2258
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,560
should be around

2259
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,679
three to five inches

2260
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,560
so moving to the last section of

2261
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,400
propeller selection fundamentals there

2262
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,560
are also different things that affect

2263
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,600
the overall propeller selection and

2264
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,320
these are shape weight and surface area

2265
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:40,960
so

2266
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,360
of course more the surface area more air

2267
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,400
will it cut

2268
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,239
more thrust it will generate but again

2269
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,000
more amperes will it consume

2270
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,440
and less flight time will you get

2271
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,440
something which some propeller

2272
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,600
manufacturer did a couple of years back

2273
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,239
is take a six inch propeller and cut one

2274
01:13:58,239 --> 01:13:58,719
inches

2275
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:00,159
from it so what you will get is

2276
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,159
effectively more surface area

2277
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:05,040
uh but with the same length so it's

2278
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,480
called bull nose propellers as you can

2279
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,520
see in the second

2280
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,640
photo on the screen uh these are not

2281
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,000
very efficient propeller but it will

2282
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,679
give you more thrust which were suitable

2283
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:14,640
for racing

2284
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,679
i don't think anyone uses it anymore so

2285
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,120
there are bull nose there are hybrid

2286
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,960
bull nose

2287
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,640
now let's talk about the weight of this

2288
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,400
propeller so of course

2289
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,640
the lighter the propeller is the easier

2290
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,199
it will be for your motors to spin it

2291
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:32,960
but again the heavier the propeller is

2292
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,040
it is more difficult for motor to spin

2293
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,960
and the overall effective rpm of this

2294
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,159
motor reduces

2295
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,880
but that is the case and lighter the

2296
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:41,760
propeller the

2297
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,040
more agility it will give you so

2298
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,040
that is a sweet spot again you need to

2299
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,080
find but

2300
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,440
uh one thing that you can be really

2301
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,320
sure of is as long as your motor and

2302
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,000
propeller combination

2303
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,760
is not drawing abnormal amount of

2304
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,520
current you are okay

2305
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,000
to use any length of propeller any shape

2306
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,080
of propeller and any number of blades or

2307
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,040
any material

2308
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,719
whether your propeller is made of wood

2309
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,800
or plastic or carbon fiber

2310
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,719
or it has three blades or six plates or

2311
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,400
whatever it is having uh

2312
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,480
seven inch of length or four point five

2313
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,520
of a pinch

2314
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,159
as long as it is not consuming abnormal

2315
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:19,040
amount of current

2316
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,440
it's okay but once it consumes more than

2317
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,360
a limit of current it can burn the motor

2318
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,000
wire

2319
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,080
it can demagnetize the magnets and it

2320
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,159
can permanently damage the esc

2321
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:30,080
so always make sure that it doesn't

2322
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,600
consume abnormal current

2323
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,960
and it stays in the rating limits of

2324
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,280
motor and esc current so if your esc is

2325
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,320
30 ampere

2326
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,880
make sure to not go beyond 25 amperes or

2327
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:41,440
it will

2328
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,400
burn the esc

2329
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,560
okay so that was all for today's class

2330
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,480
and i hope you would be having

2331
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,719
some questions some doubts and i would

2332
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:55,760
be able to

2333
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,320
uh take that in the office hours uh to

2334
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,640
come so if you are watching this class

2335
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,000
on the very first day then tomorrow

2336
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,440
we'll be having the office hours and you

2337
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,960
will be communicated by the email to

2338
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,280
join uh so that was the first chapter

2339
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,719
