5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,280
companies

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,039
i've done from complete in-house

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,199
products for agricultural startups

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,279
to silicon mall making for low scale

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,680
production to cheat metal for points of

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,199
sales

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,720
i have experience in embedded

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,480
programming for electronics

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
and industrial design and i've partnered

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
with academy to bring you all

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,920
linux plus electronics a raspberry pi

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,559
course

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,520
as part of hackadayu in this class i'll

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,480
be discussing

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,600
how to start with a linux computer and

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,120
you will learn the basics

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,920
on how to upgrade your project to the

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,760
next level

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,399
maybe your project requires a full

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,559
operating system to be run on

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,800
maybe more computational power or a

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,320
better platform to have

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,039
multiple parts connected to this is the

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,960
course for you

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,799
i remember the time where i didn't

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,720
understand anything about linux

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,479
and i just copied and pasted every

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,640
command without knowing what it did

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,880
because it felt there was a gap between

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,600
what i knew about microcontrollers

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,920
and how to operate linux for indebted

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,280
purposes

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,000
we are here to lower that gap you'll

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
learn about flashing and installing

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
linux operating system

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
how to configure the raspberry pi basic

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,200
linux commands on the console how to

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
make scripts and programs

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,680
and how to interface with electronics

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,000
connected to web

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,840
everyone interested in taking this

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,159
course to have a basic understanding of

47
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:42,640
what is

48
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,159
linux and what is a gpio a simple

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,799
search on the internet it will be enough

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,360
everything else will learn it in class

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,560
we hope you'll join us for linux plus

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,880
electronics a raspberry pi course and

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,880
i'm looking forward to working with you

54
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,439
all
