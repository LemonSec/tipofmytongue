2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,720
hey everybody

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,679
uh welcome back you are here for class

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,320
number two

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,000
of prototyping and mechanical

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,640
engineering i am will fisher

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,080
you can see my name there on the screen

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,000
it'll show up on every single slide so

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,199
you won't forget who i am

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,320
i am a prototyping engineer i am an

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,400
american based out of berlin germany

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,920
and i have more than a decade of

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,679
mechanical engineering experience plus

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,000
also

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,679
some like other stuff in intellectual

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,040
property and business and i've

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,880
co-founded a couple of companies and all

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,480
sorts of stuff i'm repping

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,239
the home team here with a nasa t-shirt i

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,000
did my master's research at nasa

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
um so i've got i feel pretty validated

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,280
in wearing that

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
um so we'll dive right in then um

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,039
and uh get on cooking because we had a

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,480
lot to cover today

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,199
uh let's see um so we're gonna talk

27
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,120
about materials today and i'm gonna

28
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,719
start in with kind of a horror story of

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,000
what goes wrong when mechanical

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,960
engineers

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,280
get materials incorrect and that is

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
something that happened 35 years ago

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,760
last week

34
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,799
which is the spatial challenger disaster

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,479
and the disaster was caused in part

36
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,920
because of a failure from an o-ring

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,200
and it went through a whole lot of

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
reviews and this sort of stuff um but

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,240
the o-rings

40
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,920
were not designed to operate at the

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,520
temperature that they were operating at

42
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,080
and

43
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,119
despite uh the the hesitation

44
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,720
on the part of some of the manufacturers

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,320
they went ahead with the launch and of

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,640
course uh tragedy occurred and so this

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
is a really important thing to think

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,320
about

49
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,000
when it comes to choosing uh your

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,119
choosing your materials when you're

51
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,759
doing uh design

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,720
um so uh this is not the only time when

53
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,240
that happens sometimes it's just a big

54
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
pain in the butt maybe not dangerous

55
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,000
the oakland bay bridge which is the

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,439
bridge that connects san francisco and

57
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,720
oakland in california

58
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,360
one of my possibly my favorite bridge

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,799
i'm biased because i lived in oakland

60
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,000
for many years

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,640
um but the oakland bay bridge when it

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,000
was under construction they discovered

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,759
part of the way through the construction

64
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,320
that the steel that they had ordered had

65
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,399
too high of a hydrogen content which

66
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,959
led to hydrogen embrittlement and uh

67
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,000
that made the

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,480
the bolts fracture as they were starting

69
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,319
to thread the nuts onto them and these

70
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,520
are huge like

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,239
bridge sized bolts so totally crazy

72
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,480
stuff

73
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,720
so that's why materials are super

74
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,760
important

75
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,480
i also want to take a quick movie break

76
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,360
to enjoy

77
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,440
how materials are commonly looked at in

78
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,440
science this is not in fact

79
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,840
how it is in the real world so

80
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,920
i combine the crystals in a tungsten

81
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,200
titanium matrix

82
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,680
at super cool temperatures and that's

83
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
what they betray

84
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,879
the applications for this

85
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,000
material well its real name has 37

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,440
syllables

87
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,599
i call it an obtainium so this is

88
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,920
one of the classic unobtainium scenes

89
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
but let's have another one just for good

90
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,000
measure because

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
unobtainium is not a real material it's

92
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,000
a portmanteau of

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
unobtainable and uh

94
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,159
this is why we're here uh inium

95
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,840
because this little gray rock sells for

96
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,280
20 million a kilo

97
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,599
that's the only reason it's repaid for

98
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,560
the whole party

99
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,920
it's what pays for your science

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,080
now those savages are threatening so

101
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
anyway you kind of get the idea here um

102
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,120
and that is

103
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,680
uh that uh you know the movies will

104
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,280
often take a very interesting

105
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
uh approach to materials and engineering

106
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,799
materials and they often name things

107
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,599
unobtainium

108
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,440
which i think is totally ludicrous we

109
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,959
will not be discussing any more

110
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,920
unobtanium

111
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,239
for the rest of the day except as jokes

112
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,040
um so

113
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,519
we'll move right along um today's agenda

114
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,959
we already kind of covered why material

115
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,319
selection is important

116
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,040
um it has a lot of ramifications um for

117
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,799
your design and how you build stuff and

118
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,159
in fact the reason that i put this is

119
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,799
class two

120
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,159
is that uh really it should be the start

121
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,599
of your design

122
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,239
is okay i want to build a thing what do

123
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,680
i make it out of before i even start

124
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,560
designing

125
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,159
i want to know if i'm building out of

126
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,599
plastic or metal i mean that is a

127
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,760
fundamental and important question

128
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,519
so we're going to cover some of those

129
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,760
excuse me cover some of those things

130
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,440
today and why you might choose one

131
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,880
material over another is where we'll

132
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,839
start

133
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,440
and then i'm going to do a deeper dive

134
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,520
into specific materials

135
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,360
themselves and what their real

136
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,960
advantages and disadvantages are

137
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,720
so that will be we'll start out with

138
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,080
metals

139
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,880
which is a field in itself actually

140
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,040
basically every slide there are 63

141
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,560
slides in the slide deck

142
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,479
every single one of them is a entire

143
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,720
career in itself

144
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,840
so we are moving as fast as fast can be

145
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,800
um and uh just remember that there is a

146
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,240
ton of science behind

147
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,800
all of these things after metals will do

148
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,240
plastics and polymers

149
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
we'll touch extremely briefly on

150
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,240
ceramics and why they're used in an

151
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,759
engineering context

152
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,479
we're not going to look into like uh

153
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,039
like

154
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,600
pots and pans but well we'll look into

155
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,639
pans

156
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,320
and then we'll look at composites after

157
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
that to finish this up

158
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,680
and so that makes for what is uh an

159
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,560
extremely

160
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,520
fast moving day so let's not delay let's

161
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:15,919
hop

162
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,479
right into it we're going to take a look

163
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,800
right now at material selection criteria

164
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,520
this is how you choose your materials

165
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,000
material selection is not surprisingly

166
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,720
extremely

167
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,360
application specific what works in one

168
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,000
material

169
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,080
does not work in another uh you would

170
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,479
never use gasoline to build a bridge

171
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,840
because gasoline is a liquid right so

172
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,880
that is true

173
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,479
across the spectrum and that's true even

174
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,160
today we're gonna focus entirely on

175
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,960
solids

176
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,320
uh i'll look at liquids and gases in

177
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,280
week four when we talk about fluids but

178
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,120
in terms of choosing your specific

179
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
solids there's

180
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,199
still a huge variety um and your

181
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,639
application may require multiple

182
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,600
materials so

183
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,880
for instance um steel by itself uh

184
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,080
is uh good it tends to buckle

185
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,440
if compressed um in long spans

186
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,160
and so concrete on the other hand tends

187
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,880
to rupture

188
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,120
in tension so a lot of times you'll see

189
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,440
concrete used with steel reinforcements

190
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,400
to create a very strong uh a very strong

191
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,000
material for a large

192
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,600
scale thing i'll talk a little bit more

193
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,440
about that reinforcement

194
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,720
when we talk about concrete in the

195
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,479
composite section

196
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,919
it could also be that you want an

197
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,600
extremely lightweight material

198
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,720
that's very strong something like

199
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,160
aluminum the problem is you have

200
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,919
electronic components going on it and

201
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,039
what you really don't want to do is put

202
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,240
your nice fancy board

203
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,759
directly on your piece of aluminum

204
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,600
because you will short out and destroy

205
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,120
your board that's bad news so you might

206
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,280
use something for electrical insulation

207
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,240
heat shrink or or coating of some sort

208
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,680
you could do this for thermal insulation

209
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,000
as well

210
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,840
we'll talk about those two things in a

211
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,160
little bit more here in a second

212
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,520
at the end of the day you will choose

213
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
the best material for your

214
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,360
project um that's probably going to

215
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
require some compromise

216
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,000
there is no material that does

217
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
everything and if there was it would be

218
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,919
so outrageously expensive you would

219
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,440
never be able to afford it

220
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,840
so um we're going to consider a lot of

221
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,560
things

222
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
here's just kind of a list of some of

223
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,599
the things and i'll talk about a couple

224
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,479
of extras as we go through

225
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,120
so the first of your material selection

226
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,720
is always going to be price and i know

227
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,240
that sounds crazy because

228
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,880
you think wait but safety first in this

229
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
case you're not going to build anything

230
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,599
if you cannot pay for it and

231
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,599
and that's kind of a fundamental truth

232
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,520
um and so this is why

233
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
certain building materials aluminum

234
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,039
plastics those sorts of things which are

235
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:33,840
very cheap

236
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,919
uh people build stuff out of and you

237
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,680
don't see nearly as much stuff if you

238
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,599
just look in the world around you

239
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,479
probably very few things that you use

240
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,440
for a purpose an

241
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,599
engineered thing rather than an

242
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,599
aesthetic thing or made out of gold

243
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,000
um or platinum even silver i mean these

244
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
are such expensive materials you would

245
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,639
never you would never go and build

246
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,400
something out of gold

247
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
for you know other than maybe gold

248
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,319
plating for electrical conductivity

249
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,759
there are places where gold is used and

250
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,759
i'll talk about those but at least for

251
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,960
the most part you're not going to build

252
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,919
out of out of those things

253
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,440
and and at the end of the day materials

254
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,039
probably have the single greatest impact

255
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,479
on your product price and not

256
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,599
necessarily in

257
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,280
choosing the cheaper material will be

258
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,000
cheaper sometimes your manufacturing is

259
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,360
influenced by

260
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,199
your materials and so it's important to

261
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,440
know how easy it is

262
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,919
to use a material not just to buy a

263
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,800
material

264
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
and so we'll talk about those as we go

265
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,919
through each of the things like for

266
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,560
example

267
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,320
um you know stainless is really a pain

268
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,200
to work with

269
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,120
it's expensive to machine stainless even

270
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,719
though it's a magical material once you

271
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,360
get it

272
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,279
the shape you want it it's a pain to get

273
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,559
to be that shape so

274
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,839
that's an important thing to think about

275
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,958
and something you think about with

276
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,760
respect to price

277
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,240
weight is another really interesting one

278
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,800
so weight

279
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,120
technically is a force um it's the force

280
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,320
of gravity on a thing

281
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,800
it's it's like you know you sell it

282
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,320
gravity accelerates you

283
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,200
and newton so on and so forth um but but

284
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,720
what's really important when choosing a

285
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,680
material

286
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,360
select material selection when it comes

287
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
to weight is really more the density of

288
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,800
the material because

289
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,680
i can get the same strength out of paper

290
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,000
as i can out of steel if i use enough

291
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,040
paper the problem is that is a lot of

292
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,839
paper

293
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,600
and the weight of that is going to be

294
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,279
insane and so you're really looking at

295
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,200
this kind of strength to weight ratio as

296
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,279
it's colloquially referred to

297
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,320
and that's something we'll talk about in

298
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,600
the next slide

299
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,839
um but before we get to that i want to

300
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,959
note that hollow

301
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,880
objects from a design perspective are

302
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,080
really really

303
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
incredible um and this is why nature

304
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,800
does things like bamboo which i have

305
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,080
shown here

306
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,160
you also see this in a lot of engineered

307
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,440
places uh

308
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,080
such as bicycle frames and aircraft

309
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,720
bodies

310
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,800
and the reason for this is the vast

311
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,040
majority of the strength of a solid bulk

312
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,200
material you know if i have a

313
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,440
brick of like this is a solid piece of

314
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
brass which i'll get to in the brass

315
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,839
section

316
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,320
um which is also a musical instrument

317
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,959
section

318
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,800
um but uh but this is pretty strong

319
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,079
but if i have this hollow i get

320
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,920
you know depending on the wall thickness

321
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,240
i can get upwards of 70 percent of the

322
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,040
strength

323
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,839
with you know 20 or percent of the

324
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,880
weight or less

325
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,800
and so when you're designing things i

326
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
would encourage you to think hollow

327
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,720
um when you're designing stuff for

328
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,640
structural purposes

329
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,480
um cool so strength

330
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,880
is actually kind of a strange thing

331
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
because uh

332
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,399
it's not a strength as a word is not

333
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,200
well defined in the engineering sense

334
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,440
we use things like rigidity how how much

335
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,399
something bends how much strain you have

336
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,000
under a certain amount of stress which

337
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,440
is the amount of

338
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,680
force you're applying to the thing and

339
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,240
so what you see down here in this corner

340
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,720
is

341
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,200
a stress strain diagram and this is kind

342
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,720
of a generic one

343
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,640
and what that is on the vertical axis is

344
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,240
how much load you're putting into a

345
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,040
thing

346
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,560
and what you're seeing here on the

347
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,640
horizontal axis is

348
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,360
how far it deflects and what you'll

349
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,040
notice is and this is true for

350
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,160
almost all materials interact in some

351
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,920
way like this chart

352
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,600
when you apply a force it begins to

353
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,880
yield

354
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,519
and that's called uh that's like it

355
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,360
flexing i'll show you

356
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
an example of this with this piece of

357
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
carbon fiber so

358
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,560
you can see it starts to bend as i load

359
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,000
it but it's it's

360
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,920
still within that yield strength in

361
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,440
which case it goes back to

362
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,959
it's below its elastic limit so it

363
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,560
returns to its original shape

364
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,800
and this is true of basically everything

365
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,160
different things have different

366
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,240
um have different amounts of things so

367
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
the elastic strapping on my mask

368
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,839
i can deform maybe you know

369
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,880
50 or more before i start to like

370
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,920
actually tear it

371
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,560
and i'm still within that elastic limit

372
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,440
after that

373
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,680
i can continue to bend it for a while

374
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,279
and it won't return to its original

375
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,000
shape

376
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,160
it'll still try but it won't get all the

377
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,000
way there at some point i'm going to get

378
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,760
to the ultimate strength

379
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,519
in this case it's talking about tension

380
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,680
and so you can see in the diagrams here

381
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,040
that i'm pulling a thing and that's

382
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,720
usually done in one of these machines

383
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,240
these are usually called instron which

384
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,920
is a brand name but it's a strength

385
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
tester it's a tensile strength tester

386
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,160
and it pulls and measures how much force

387
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,440
it's applying and then

388
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,680
looks at this displacement and gives you

389
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,279
this curve

390
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,040
and so what will happen is in a metal

391
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,240
you'll start with this thing called

392
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,200
necking and

393
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,920
you've probably like observed this in

394
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,560
things like

395
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
plato as you start to deform it it

396
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,800
starts to to draw out and get really

397
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,560
skinny and then

398
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,480
it'll start to get cracks in it and then

399
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,680
it'll finally

400
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,399
it'll finally fail over here well past

401
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,480
the ultimate tensile strength

402
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
and that's your material is going it's

403
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,160
shattered it's whatever it is

404
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,880
it's it's failed and that's um that's

405
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,240
not a good thing anyway this is an

406
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,600
important background when you think

407
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,200
about a material strength

408
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
is how much of that is it needs to be

409
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,040
resilient back to its original form

410
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,480
and how much of that is i need this

411
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,360
thing to not fail when i like

412
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
hop on to a swing set um but if it

413
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,200
bends a little bit i don't care much if

414
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,959
it bends back or not

415
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,959
and the swing set maybe you do want it

416
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,240
to bend back

417
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,360
maybe a poor example durability is kind

418
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,720
of closely tied

419
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,079
with strength though it is distinct

420
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,959
durability is really about repeated wear

421
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,399
and this can happen in a variety of

422
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,519
different ways

423
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,040
what you can see down here is what's

424
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
called a

425
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,519
a living hinge and those are things you

426
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,959
see on the top of bottle caps all the

427
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,760
time

428
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,399
and it's molded in a single piece but

429
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,680
eventually that thing's probably going

430
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,279
to wear out and so you choose

431
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,519
your material based on that flexibility

432
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,079
so that you can use it

433
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,320
to do that this picture here you see is

434
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,760
what's called galling and that's what

435
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,519
happens when you have two pieces moving

436
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,959
with respect to each other

437
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,639
in a repeated fashion so this can happen

438
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,639
on the inside of bearings as shown here

439
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,959
talking more about that in week five um

440
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,560
but this is where the material starts to

441
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,000
bind on itself and it

442
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,560
and it starts to create these streaks so

443
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,360
you can see the

444
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,399
the rotational direction here on that

445
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,079
and that's what happens this is a really

446
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,279
extreme case of it but that's what

447
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,639
happens when your bearings run without

448
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,360
oil

449
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,000
and it makes every mechanical engineer's

450
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,480
uh

451
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,399
heart drop when you hear the sound of a

452
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,519
gold component

453
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,279
rolling around and somewhere it's it's

454
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,279
horrific um but you're thinking about

455
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:23,920
durability

456
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,079
durability with respect to repeated use

457
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,279
so if you're designing something as a

458
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,000
prototype

459
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,839
maybe you maybe you 3d print it your

460
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,079
durability is not that big a deal

461
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,040
because you're going to use it once

462
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,199
twice three times and then chuck it but

463
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,720
if you want to use something

464
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,639
forever maybe you need to think about a

465
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,880
bigger and better material

466
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,399
corrosion is another really important

467
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,440
thing i'm going to talk about this a

468
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
bunch in the metal section

469
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,399
but it does apply potentially to other

470
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,399
materials in some

471
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,639
kind of edge cases for example if you

472
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,600
have ceramics

473
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,880
in an extremely reactive plasma it can

474
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,160
corrode i know this because i've done it

475
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
and so this is something to kind of pay

476
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,079
attention to a broad thing

477
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,160
most materials that aren't metal this is

478
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,120
less of a concern

479
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,320
so we won't touch on that so much heat

480
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
and thermal effects are a big and

481
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,800
important part

482
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,639
of your material selection i'm showing a

483
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,399
cast iron pan here don't worry the same

484
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,800
picture comes up later

485
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,199
and that's because cast iron is really

486
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,040
interesting in a lot of ways

487
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,880
it is an excellent thermal conductor but

488
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,639
it also has a high specific heat

489
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,000
capacity and what that means

490
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,560
is you can store a lot of heat in it and

491
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,160
the reason you get a great steak out of

492
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,040
a cast iron

493
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
which you don't get out of an aluminum

494
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,320
pan is

495
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,720
the aluminum has also very high thermal

496
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,639
conductivity but it doesn't hold as much

497
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,040
heat

498
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
and so when you flop that stake onto

499
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,279
your uh onto your cat onto your cast

500
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:43,839
iron

501
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,480
it really cooks that bottom really fast

502
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,920
and that seals in the juices and you get

503
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,360
a much better steak out of it

504
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,600
i like steak um so

505
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,759
um different materials have kind of

506
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,040
thermal conductivity

507
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,839
is the property and i i put two bullet

508
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,800
points here

509
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,639
one is a thermal insulator and one is a

510
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,079
thermal conductor and and

511
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,519
that is the same property that is

512
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,279
thermal conductivity

513
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,800
explained through kind of two different

514
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
lenses if i want something to keep me

515
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,320
warm if it's a jacket or something i

516
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,519
want something that is a thermal

517
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,120
insulator that means it has low thermal

518
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,079
conductivity

519
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,519
if i want something to be a heat sink

520
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,279
then i would really like to have high

521
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,639
thermal conductivity and

522
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,800
this is important to think about in a

523
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
variety of different

524
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,079
contexts thermal expansion and

525
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,600
dimensional change is another important

526
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,199
part of it and that kind of

527
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,079
is a lead up into melting point so most

528
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,040
materials expand when heated

529
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,600
this is there's a degree to which

530
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,199
thermal expansion happens

531
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,680
and so for example like aluminum expands

532
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,720
more thermally

533
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,519
than steel does by a lot um and actually

534
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,360
one of my favorite youtubers mark rober

535
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,000
has built

536
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,959
a ice cream safe based on this principle

537
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,320
that at room temperature

538
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,759
they just barely fit together but when

539
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,360
you freeze this thing

540
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,560
the aluminum lid shrinks a lot more onto

541
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,920
the steel contraption

542
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,559
and it's just completely unopenable but

543
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,599
you run it under

544
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,000
uh warm water the lid expands again you

545
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,599
can take this thing apart

546
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,839
just some brilliant engineering it's so

547
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,000
simple and so elegant

548
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,079
um and so you should you should expect

549
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,280
that sort of

550
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,240
dimensional change and if you're

551
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,359
designing for something that's going to

552
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,799
be operating over a wide variety of

553
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,000
temperatures

554
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,799
think about that as you're designing

555
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,400
we'll talk a little bit tiny bit more

556
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,679
about that in the thermal section in

557
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,200
week four

558
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,880
melting point is an important part of

559
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,400
your material um

560
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
clearly if you are looking for something

561
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,760
that needs to get very hot if you make

562
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,400
it out of

563
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,000
um low temperature plastics uh or lead

564
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,360
you're gonna end up with your material

565
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,799
running away from you so melting points

566
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:45,840
point's an

567
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,320
important one to think about because it

568
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,160
it influences your design but also

569
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,760
that's true uh with

570
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
the flow temperature and thermoplastics

571
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,200
more on that in plastics

572
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,760
i know i'm saying more on that and it's

573
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,160
because we are going to cover a lot

574
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,160
okay cool um workability is a massive

575
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,520
and important thing and this probably

576
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,200
ought to be up there with price in terms

577
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,280
of the importance of this

578
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,360
when you are making stuff it's important

579
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,760
that you can make stuff

580
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,799
from your stuff um and that

581
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,000
you should think about how you're going

582
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,080
to build it with your material selection

583
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,520
and those things go hand in hand

584
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,960
i did materials first before

585
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,120
manufacturing because

586
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,160
we're going to talk a lot about

587
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
materials next week and i want you to

588
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,720
have the basis for it

589
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,840
but honestly these these are are twins

590
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,200
in the world of design um and so you

591
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,720
need to think about your design how are

592
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,679
you going to build this

593
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,039
okay what am i going to build it out of

594
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,160
and uh and so if i'm going to be

595
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,840
machining something how machinable is my

596
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,720
material

597
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,559
in this in this particular case you know

598
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,640
maybe a different grade of aluminum is

599
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,760
more machinable

600
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,360
and so i choose that that's certainly

601
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,600
true with steels um

602
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,679
and weld-ability is also important if

603
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,960
i'm going to be making a big structure

604
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,039
and i'm going to have to weld it

605
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,559
then i need to make sure i'm choosing

606
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,039
weldable material

607
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,160
formable is kind of a word there's not a

608
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,919
great definition for this but the idea

609
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,120
of formable is

610
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,919
can i like press it until it assumes the

611
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,919
shape that i want it to be

612
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,440
whereas i would distinguish that from

613
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,640
moldable in that moldable materials

614
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,600
are ones where you would pour parts into

615
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,320
pour

616
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,799
something liquid into a mold and then it

617
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,919
would become a shape

618
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,400
that would harden after that um i'll

619
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,520
talk about that

620
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,600
also later on i skipped one

621
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,559
yeah okay um electrical uh is an

622
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,520
important material

623
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
component uh for your mechanical

624
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,600
engineering um you can choose materials

625
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,000
that are

626
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,679
electrically conductive or electrically

627
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,280
insulating again like thermal

628
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,640
considerations that's all

629
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,799
on the continuum of electrical

630
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,679
conductivity

631
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,039
which is a material property you can

632
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,799
look up insulating is

633
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,200
low electrical conductivity and

634
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,840
conductive

635
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,600
is high conductivity same as thermal

636
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,120
and actually the picture i've got here

637
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,039
is one of aluminum wiring which is used

638
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:05,600
in

639
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
low-cost applications because aluminum

640
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,120
is much cheaper

641
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,200
than copper unfortunately it's not as

642
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,120
conductive and so you end up with

643
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,200
heating and fires and that sort of stuff

644
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,559
if you don't use enough of it or you

645
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,320
have to use more of it and one of the

646
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,000
things i find when i'm in berlin is that

647
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,559
i

648
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,559
one of my recreational hobbies is to go

649
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,120
and trespass on abandoned buildings

650
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,640
and um you find a lot of the old

651
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,039
east german construction use aluminum

652
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,720
wiring and so they've cut through these

653
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,440
huge

654
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,840
you know big pipes of of electrical

655
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,640
things for

656
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,320
you know blast furnaces and chemical

657
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,080
plants and all of these cool places

658
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,400
and these big aluminum wires in there

659
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,760
and i'm just looking at them i'm like oh

660
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,240
this is

661
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
this is a disaster waiting to happen

662
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,600
though in fairness the

663
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,280
fall of communism was the disaster that

664
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,440
actually happened um

665
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,080
so um also electrical components tend to

666
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,000
have magnetic properties as well

667
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
when you're using ferroferrous metals

668
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,720
which we'll talk about in a second

669
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,280
they tend to be magnetic as well so

670
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,559
think about that if you have a magnetic

671
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,360
application

672
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,760
putting something near a motor if you

673
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,280
need to

674
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,799
to have something that's non-magnetic

675
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,480
you can choose

676
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,559
you can choose those things and that's

677
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,919
also true if you're thinking about

678
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,120
static discharge so if you have

679
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,640
sensitive electronic components you may

680
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,679
want to think about whether or not you

681
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,039
want to use a metal nearby

682
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,159
this is an important and important thing

683
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,880
cool let's move along now we're looking

684
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,480
at chemical compatibility and this is

685
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:28,960
more

686
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
important if you intend to be using your

687
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,320
materials

688
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,559
um in conjunction with your liquids and

689
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,520
gases so

690
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,120
what i've got up here is a chart of

691
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,559
solvent compatibility

692
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,080
and this is a very standard thing that

693
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,039
you look at when you're building

694
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,400
something that's going to go into say a

695
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,559
laboratory application if you're doing

696
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,360
your own

697
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,400
uh like home biology stuff

698
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,840
when you're making your own reaction

699
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,320
vessels this is an extremely important

700
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,679
thing to think about

701
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,679
and so what you're looking at here is

702
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,159
your materials on the top

703
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,039
and then what dissolves them basically

704
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,679
over here

705
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,080
on the left and what you'll notice is

706
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,000
ptfe which is commonly referred to as

707
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,080
teflon polytetrafluoroethylene

708
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,720
we'll talk that it's got a whole slide

709
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,320
over here has excellent

710
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,799
uh has excellent resistance to most

711
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,400
things except for benzene which is a

712
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,679
terrifying solvent

713
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,080
um and so you know you can kind of look

714
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,799
across like

715
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,039
hey if i'm going to be using this with

716
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,480
uh ethyl alcohol which

717
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
is common drinking alcohol ethanol um

718
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,400
then i can use uh abs plastic or

719
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,000
high-density polyethylene

720
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,440
no problem and so i would go and kind of

721
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,159
look at these things before i

722
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,520
manufacture something so

723
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,280
i've built a handful of cocktail robots

724
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,880
because they're super fun and so i come

725
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,679
in here and i look

726
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,880
at my ethyl alcohol and

727
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,679
water as those most of these are these

728
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:49,919
are

729
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,600
not water soluble so i don't worry about

730
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,640
that but that's something that i would

731
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,000
think about

732
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,480
in my design thing finally i want to

733
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,679
talk a little bit about some other

734
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,600
things safety uh this is a picture from

735
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,280
one of those recreational trespassing

736
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,200
exhibits you might notice there is a

737
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,320
hanging lump of asbestos um that stuff

738
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,960
is uh highly carcinogenic when it's

739
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,039
blowing around in the breeze as it was

740
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,840
um and i think that's something to think

741
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,200
about when you're designing as

742
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,120
well whether or not my materials are

743
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,039
safe

744
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,440
i think also as you're thinking about

745
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,120
materials there's another

746
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,360
uh direction you can go which is past

747
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,400
just safety is what's called

748
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,679
biocompatibility and i would

749
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,120
differentiate those

750
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,440
safety is if i invite an actor interact

751
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,559
with it in the environment something

752
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,440
like asbestos

753
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,480
is unsafe led not too too safe

754
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,640
in most cases so you can work with it

755
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,240
anyway and i have

756
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,080
biocompatibility i would differentiate

757
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,159
as i would let someone implant this in

758
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:44,880
my body

759
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,159
and i would be okay with it sitting

760
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,840
under my skin for a while and there are

761
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,120
biocompatible materials

762
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,640
they make implants out of stuff all the

763
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,799
time gold for instance is a phenomenally

764
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,360
biocompatible material unfortunately

765
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,120
uh it's expensive optical properties are

766
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,400
also important if you need something

767
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,360
that you're going to look out the front

768
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
of a windshield for it's best if it's

769
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,480
not opaque

770
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,279
um and so uh that's an important one to

771
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,080
think about

772
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,200
if you're building something that has to

773
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,520
be aesthetically pleasing which i'm not

774
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,480
good at

775
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,279
um but many people are that's an

776
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,039
important thing so you may choose

777
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,400
something that holds paint well or

778
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,559
something like that uh flammability is

779
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,840
an important thing if you

780
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,320
have any worries about that again that's

781
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,039
uh

782
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,840
that's context specific and uh also

783
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,159
hydrophobicity so that is the tendency

784
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,000
of water to beat up on the surface of a

785
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,720
thing

786
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,559
something like paper if you drop a drop

787
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,000
of water on it though it's going to soak

788
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,120
right in

789
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,039
something like teflon you drop a bead of

790
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,799
water on it it's going to

791
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,799
stay as a bead on top and that's

792
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,799
important for a variety of reasons

793
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,240
in context you might want it makes

794
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,760
things easier to clean if you're using

795
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,360
the foods

796
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,520
um so that's why typically you choose

797
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,279
like pvc tubing for

798
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,440
foods um because pvc is pretty

799
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,200
hydrophobic it's pretty cheap

800
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,039
and you can pipe around your alcohol in

801
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,240
it just fine

802
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
um there's a whole variety of other

803
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,679
other stuff

804
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,440
that you may run into as you're

805
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,360
designing and think of these

806
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,919
as as important in your material

807
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,919
selections

808
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,320
so cool that is all of our material

809
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,919
selection criteria cool we've crossed

810
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,640
one of them off how are we doing on time

811
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,000
oh i should move faster um cool

812
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,760
um so now we're going to get into metals

813
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,440
i'm going to go through and cover metals

814
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,880
one by one

815
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,159
this is on the quiz later uh but anyway

816
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,760
i just wanted to make a joke about this

817
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,559
is heavy metal

818
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,919
many of my favorite artists what is

819
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:36,720
metal metal

820
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,840
uh are these blocks in yellow over here

821
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,279
also if you guys have questions plop

822
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,320
them up and chat

823
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,000
um as we're going and then during the q

824
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,679
a i'll go and look at all of them i

825
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,880
don't have my headphones on and i'm not

826
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,000
reading chat so if

827
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
i want to answer until the end anyway um

828
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,039
so anyway back to what we were working

829
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,720
on right here these things are all

830
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,760
considered metals

831
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,360
under here everything that's in that

832
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,279
kind of yellowish color and they tend to

833
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,520
share some things in common

834
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,880
tend to be electrically and thermally

835
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,440
conductive ductal meaning you can draw

836
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,279
them and they stretch like we saw in the

837
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,480
strength thing

838
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,559
malleable meaning you can pound them and

839
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,520
work them

840
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,360
and sectal meaning you can shave them

841
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,880
with a sharp implement

842
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,559
and this is important in the way that

843
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,240
you fabricate metals all three of those

844
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,360
things come into play

845
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,200
if you want wire it's important that

846
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
it's ductile if you want to

847
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,440
forge something malleability matters and

848
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,880
sectility matters in the world of

849
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,520
machining

850
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,360
uh which is week three um alloyable is

851
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,000
uh

852
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,320
typical um and that's true whether

853
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,840
you're looking at kind of a

854
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,480
aesthetic noble metal such as gold

855
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,200
platinum

856
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,080
being alloyed or gold and silver to make

857
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,039
white gold

858
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,559
or whether you need a high strength

859
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,000
something or other like stainless steel

860
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,480
which

861
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,440
i'll talk about in a sec we'll talk

862
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
about how you fabricate metals

863
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,679
next week and so i'm going to make

864
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,039
references to some of those things and

865
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,640
some of those fabrication methods

866
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,159
and just know that that's not happening

867
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,679
this time but we'll talk about that next

868
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,320
week how

869
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,840
how those things kind of all matter

870
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,000
together

871
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,799
metal is created in grains and this is

872
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,400
an important part you've actually can't

873
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,000
probably witness this if you've looked

874
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,480
at

875
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,559
parts i don't know if my galvanized

876
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,400
steel thing here has grains i can see

877
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,679
them but i don't think my camera will

878
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,960
pick them up which is unfortunate

879
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,640
but uh you can kind of see these

880
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,480
pictures here and these greens are

881
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,000
interesting so the way that those work

882
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,880
is those are

883
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,120
a single crystal of metal when you look

884
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,159
at a grain

885
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,840
and they interact with each other in

886
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,640
different ways so most metals are

887
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,320
pretty close to polycrystalline meaning

888
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,000
you have these grains and then where the

889
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,279
boundaries are

890
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,600
they have these kind of metal atoms that

891
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,279
don't quite meet up and you get these

892
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,840
these dislocations and those travel

893
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,000
through and actually that's a good thing

894
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,200
um you want that to be there like that

895
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
they have a significant impact on the

896
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,960
material properties of your metal if you

897
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,200
have a single monocrystalline thing

898
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,559
it is has a very much higher um

899
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,320
yield strength but it doesn't have as

900
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,480
good elastic properties so it won't

901
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,279
go back to where it is uh wait you may

902
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,240
mess that up

903
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,440
um but it changes the the the

904
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,799
tendency when it fails um so

905
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,000
let's see higher stiffness lower

906
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,240
ultimate yield strength that's right for

907
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
lar for larger grains

908
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,039
um and so but it can also reduce creeps

909
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,559
so creep is if you have a metal being

910
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,840
pushed for a long time

911
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,679
it's going to have a tendency to deflect

912
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,880
and stay there for

913
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
forever and this is true particularly if

914
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,240
you're designing something with springs

915
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,760
that's going to stay in one place for a

916
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,480
long time

917
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,240
like if you're packaging a thing with

918
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,919
springs in it and it's going to be

919
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,200
going for years before someone opens it

920
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,200
then creep is something that's not ideal

921
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,520
you can control grain size in the way

922
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,279
that you finish your material so this is

923
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,279
often done in the manufacturer

924
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,840
um before you get a material so this is

925
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,480
this is where

926
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,080
real this is where engineers are really

927
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,559
going to pay attention to what material

928
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,600
they're getting

929
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,679
from their manufacturer and so this is

930
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,360
true in the extrusion process when

931
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,720
they're making stuff

932
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,640
so you start with a big molten bat of i

933
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,080
don't know say steel

934
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,039
and then it comes out of the molten fat

935
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:11,440
in

936
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,559
usually extrusions of some sort or uh

937
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,640
it's poured into mold and uh

938
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,240
and cast or forged or whatever

939
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,919
all of those things have impacts on the

940
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,159
way that your grain size

941
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,200
is is the outcome of your grain size

942
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,960
and so you can do things to change it

943
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,120
even after that so annealing

944
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,480
will increase the grain size work

945
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,840
hardening is where you wham it with a

946
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,279
thing which is why you see blacksmiths

947
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,120
hammering stuff

948
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,080
and that increases the strength by

949
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,600
decreasing the grain size

950
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,000
so there's kind of like a perfect um

951
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,240
there's kind of a perfect grain size

952
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,919
thing and that's this hall patch

953
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,760
strengthening limit

954
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,679
and so you really want your grains to be

955
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,080
right around the 10 nanometer

956
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,919
grain size which is way way way

957
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,159
microscopic you'll never see that

958
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,399
but that's just details you don't need

959
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,520
metals tend to oxidize almost

960
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,000
almost all metals oxidize noble metals

961
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,080
don't the metals that i've shown here

962
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,720
um the pink ones are noble um and

963
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,240
the others are sometimes considered

964
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,799
depending on who you ask as nobles

965
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,640
um and they don't they don't interact

966
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,559
with oxygen but basically every other

967
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,919
metal does

968
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,919
sometimes this is a really bad thing so

969
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,799
in the case of ferrous metals

970
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,720
they form iron iii oxide which is

971
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,640
commonly called rust

972
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,159
and that's an oxide that will continue

973
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,679
to eat through the metal and that's a

974
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,600
big problem with corrosion

975
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,760
so you don't want that many metals have

976
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,120
self-limiting oxides

977
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,799
and so this is where the metal interacts

978
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,799
with the oxygen in the air

979
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,720
and so aluminum and titanium have

980
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,000
self-limiting oxides which

981
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,440
is really nice both of them tend to be

982
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,640
quite inert once they've oxidized

983
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,399
chromium and nickel also do that and

984
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,640
they're used as alloying agents

985
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,360
to prevent the oxidation in other metals

986
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,840
which is

987
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,480
extra cool and that's the idea behind

988
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,440
this is that like

989
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,120
for instance in stainless steel you have

990
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,039
chromium high chromium content

991
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,880
and the chromium forms chromium oxide on

992
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,080
the surface of your steel

993
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,000
and that prevents the rust from

994
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,600
propagating the oxidization from

995
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,399
propagating

996
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,320
through your material allowing you to

997
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,440
have this uh

998
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,279
really nice stain rust free material

999
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,919
you can still have corrosion of some

1000
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,200
types

1001
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,240
with with your metals and and that's

1002
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,760
true even with stainless steels and

1003
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,840
things that have oxide limiting

1004
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,760
things and that's uh one i want to talk

1005
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,960
about briefly which is galvanic

1006
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,559
corrosion and this is where you have

1007
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,200
uh dissimilar electric potentials among

1008
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,159
materials

1009
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,080
as shown on this chart so you can see

1010
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,440
electric potentials

1011
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,240
on this chart um so like magnesium is

1012
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,600
extremely anodic

1013
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,559
uh while say gold is extremely cathodic

1014
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,200
um

1015
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
and so when you put those things in

1016
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,960
electrical contact in a water-based

1017
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,760
solution

1018
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,240
what will happen is um electricity will

1019
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,919
flow from one to the other

1020
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,200
and that causes uh corrosion on one

1021
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,600
and it would cause deposition on the

1022
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,679
other except oftentimes this is a

1023
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,240
moving system so like a piping system

1024
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,039
and this is something

1025
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,679
um that i have had happen in situations

1026
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,240
of my own i made a cooling system

1027
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,960
uh that that circulated liquid through

1028
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,080
uh pumps

1029
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,440
and uh i had my my steel pump connected

1030
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,039
to a brass fitting

1031
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,760
and this circulation loop ran for three

1032
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,480
years and

1033
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,399
uh when we opened up the liquid tank

1034
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,840
inside of it because it was a closed

1035
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,960
system it was all sealed there was no

1036
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,399
evaporation we opened up the tank inside

1037
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:38,880
of it

1038
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,799
we looked in it and it was just like

1039
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,799
rust juice

1040
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,360
it was just gross and it was because we

1041
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,440
had corroded these parts on the inside

1042
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,200
we took everything apart i mean it was a

1043
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,720
miracle we didn't break any of these

1044
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,159
parts because they were just

1045
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,080
corroded like crazy and any of these

1046
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,200
pieces

1047
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,440
and on its own would not have corroded

1048
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,720
in that environment but because of this

1049
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,080
galvanic corrosion they were

1050
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,360
they were doing that so i learned that

1051
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,240
one the hard way um hydrogen and brittle

1052
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,760
we talked about a little bit in the very

1053
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,120
very beginning

1054
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,960
this happens when hydrogen gets into

1055
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,559
your material into your metal

1056
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,880
and a high hydrogen content reduces the

1057
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,159
strength of things i'm not going to talk

1058
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,600
too much about this you can bake your

1059
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,159
product

1060
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,679
to get out of there unless you're doing

1061
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,279
something like a bridge

1062
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,000
or an aerospace application probably

1063
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,679
this you're not going to worry too much

1064
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,799
about this because

1065
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,360
you'll design it in such a way that you

1066
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,200
use a little bit stronger material than

1067
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,080
you need and

1068
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,360
probably you're not within the limits

1069
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:33,840
where

1070
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,279
you're not so close to your margin of

1071
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,679
safety that this is going to be a scary

1072
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,960
thing

1073
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,080
all right uh talking about um specific

1074
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,799
materials

1075
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,080
i'm going to break metals into two

1076
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,360
different groups there are metals that

1077
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,799
are ferrous that means iron containing

1078
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,399
and metals that are non-ferrous which is

1079
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,080
everything else

1080
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,559
um so we'll start out with ferrous uh

1081
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,840
the classic one of these

1082
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,919
is what what started the iron age which

1083
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,600
is cast iron

1084
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,919
uh you can also uh wrought iron which

1085
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,840
where you bend it from a shape

1086
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,159
um cast iron is really nice for a lot of

1087
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,399
reasons a it has that really really high

1088
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,079
specific heat which makes it great for

1089
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,320
cooking it's porous which means you can

1090
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,159
seep all those nice steak juices in and

1091
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,719
then things don't stick

1092
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,800
and it is also in an industrial sense

1093
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,320
it's vibration absorbing which means you

1094
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,639
can use it and make bearings out of it

1095
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,839
in places where you have acoustically uh

1096
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,760
important things you can do if you need

1097
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,119
something to be hard

1098
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,320
and also acoustically dampening uh cast

1099
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,399
iron is a good one for that

1100
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,760
just kind of a strange one so um

1101
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,918
steel is a much more common ferrous

1102
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,119
material so you can see what i've done

1103
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,440
is i've added a tiny little bit of

1104
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,679
uh carbon in there up to about a percent

1105
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,560
and a half

1106
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,719
which radically increases the strength

1107
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,320
of my iron

1108
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,199
um and so low carbon steel tends to be

1109
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,119
much easier to machine and to weld

1110
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,199
high carbon steel is just a pain to work

1111
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,239
with though it is

1112
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,200
really strong um and so you tend to use

1113
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,520
that

1114
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,079
for your tools when you're making when

1115
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,400
you're making things

1116
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,520
there are a huge variety of steels

1117
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,000
and plain steel rusts regardless of

1118
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,880
carbon content so you may want to

1119
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,760
you may want to to galvanize or paint

1120
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,000
paint

1121
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,520
it galvanizing is where you dip it in

1122
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,839
hot zinc typically or you electrocute it

1123
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,599
electroplate it in zinc

1124
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,720
painting it is painting it and powder

1125
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,800
coating is where you take a dry paint

1126
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,040
and you create an electrostatic charge

1127
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,640
and then the powder sticks to it and

1128
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,480
then you melt it and it like forms into

1129
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,760
this beautiful coating

1130
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,839
and most of the things you see are uh

1131
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,280
out there that are coated

1132
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,599
are powder coated i'm looking for an

1133
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,920
example around

1134
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,520
like this right here is some powder

1135
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,280
coated metal so you know it's this blue

1136
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,079
color but it's

1137
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,000
originally a steel piece that's been

1138
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,240
bent

1139
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,680
um the

1140
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,000
steel is typically referred to by number

1141
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,240
um and so uh

1142
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,640
carbon steels with no other alloying

1143
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,000
components are usually

1144
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,320
four digits long beginning with a one

1145
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,000
you can look in charts online all of

1146
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,560
this is

1147
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,040
typically um uh

1148
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,079
typically uh found

1149
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,440
uh in iso 4949 or in

1150
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,839
sae which is the original standard uh

1151
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,480
let's see

1152
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,640
society for automotive engineers i think

1153
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,320
but now it's sae international so it's

1154
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,920
an international standards organization

1155
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,680
and most of the planet still uses the

1156
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,200
sae standard which is

1157
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,440
an american one though you can also find

1158
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,040
iso as well

1159
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,680
but if i say a 1018 steel that's a

1160
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,440
fairly standard weldable steel that

1161
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
looks like

1162
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,280
this it's got that nice kind of grayish

1163
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,359
steel color to it and you can see this

1164
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,040
one's been uh drilled out and i've

1165
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,720
actually welded another piece of this

1166
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,160
exact bar

1167
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,760
um a different thing here is a picture

1168
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,119
this is what galvanized steel looks like

1169
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,000
it's often quite

1170
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,680
shiny sometimes you can really see you

1171
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,040
can kind of see the grain structure in

1172
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,240
there galvanic coating

1173
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,760
tends to have a really distinct grain

1174
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,000
pattern to it that prevents rusting

1175
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,960
but also please do not weld galvanized

1176
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,480
material because the zinc comes off

1177
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,000
zinc oxide gets in your lungs and is not

1178
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,520
good for you

1179
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,640
um cool

1180
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,000
that's everything about steel that you

1181
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,280
ever wanted to know let's talk about

1182
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,640
stainless steel

1183
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,440
um oh yes i'm seeing in chat uh there

1184
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,280
are two wheel fishers one is my audio

1185
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,359
and the other is my video um i get

1186
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,359
better audio off my phone

1187
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,200
sorry um stainless steel is a

1188
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,640
is a um is a

1189
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,400
an alloy of steel so you're starting

1190
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,839
with your iron and your carbon

1191
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,400
and they're alloying in significant

1192
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,320
portions of chromium and nickel

1193
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,000
and chromium and nickel both form those

1194
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,440
self-limiting oxides

1195
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,800
uh which allow you uh to prevent your

1196
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,359
your steel from rusting um so i've got

1197
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,320
this

1198
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
shoe i've got this piece here this is

1199
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,440
kind of what a stainless steel would

1200
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,640
look like you'll notice it's not rusting

1201
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,400
this is an old this is a high capacity

1202
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,800
load cell for measuring weight

1203
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,680
um and sometimes you also find it like

1204
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,040
these kind of nice rods

1205
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,640
of stainless it can be polished up to be

1206
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,118
very nice

1207
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,880
and it's wonderful stuff so there are a

1208
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,119
huge variety of stainlesses

1209
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,880
they come in numberings they tend to be

1210
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,480
three-digit long numbers

1211
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,280
300 is all austenitic and 400 series is

1212
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,880
all martensitic

1213
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,160
um and austenitic ones tend to be

1214
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,440
non-magnetic which is

1215
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,880
uncommon for iron compound iron

1216
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,560
containing compounds but

1217
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,200
uh the for whatever reason the alloying

1218
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,720
materials mean you have non-magnetic

1219
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,200
which is

1220
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,240
actually really nice because you have a

1221
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,079
high strength non-magnetic material that

1222
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:42,960
doesn't rust

1223
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,680
it's nice stuff it's a pain in the butt

1224
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,400
to machine

1225
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,560
because it work hardens with heat and so

1226
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,839
if you and it's quite

1227
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,160
it's quite hard and so if you put

1228
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,599
anything but the sharpest bit

1229
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,480
into it um what happens is the friction

1230
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,720
quickly heats the material

1231
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,280
oxygen comes in from the heat and it

1232
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,160
work hardens

1233
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,760
leaving you with just a piece of

1234
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,200
stainless steel slag

1235
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,480
and a real real real dull bit so it's

1236
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,240
one of the bigger pains to machine and

1237
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,520
most machine shops

1238
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,560
will be like all right really okay fine

1239
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,400
when you ask them to machine stainless

1240
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,240
it's also relatively difficult to weld

1241
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,720
because

1242
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,680
the materials uh relative to stainless

1243
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,599
to normal steel it's difficult to weld

1244
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,079
because the chromium and nickel at high

1245
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,599
temperatures will start to react with

1246
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,800
oxygen

1247
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,000
and you're getting further into the

1248
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,440
material and it stays reactive while

1249
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,960
it's molten

1250
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,640
so you have to weld it under a shielded

1251
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,880
argon which is standard for tig

1252
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,400
again next week it has the same iso

1253
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,720
and sae number for the numbering

1254
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,119
now we'll talk about non-ferrous metals

1255
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:47,839
that was

1256
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,680
all of the ferrous metals and however

1257
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,880
many minutes and that's everything

1258
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,079
that's not iron-based i'm going to talk

1259
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,599
about basically nothing over there on

1260
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,000
the left-hand side of your screen on the

1261
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,200
left-hand side of the periodic table

1262
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,880
with the exception of magnesium

1263
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,520
which is over here by sodium but the

1264
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,440
rest of these materials are not

1265
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,960
useful mostly in an engineering

1266
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,720
application if you come to machine

1267
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,079
something out of uranium you are a

1268
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,240
better engineer than i am um

1269
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,200
and you don't need to be watching this

1270
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,000
um

1271
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,440
and so we're gonna skip those for the

1272
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,560
most part uh we're gonna take an

1273
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,680
in-depth look at

1274
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,720
um aluminum uh copper alloys

1275
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,079
and titanium and then we're gonna go

1276
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,240
through a couple other ones really fast

1277
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,960
aluminum is magnificent aluminum is

1278
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,280
great

1279
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,000
it's cheap which is awesome uh it's easy

1280
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,960
to machine

1281
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,400
it's a little bit harder than steel to

1282
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,839
weld it's kind of like stainless steel

1283
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,520
to weld except that it has very high

1284
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,200
thermal conductivity so as you weld it

1285
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,880
it start and it starts to melt it all

1286
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,480
melts and it runs away from you very

1287
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,599
quickly

1288
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,599
but if you decide you want to weld stuff

1289
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,880
out of aluminum i am i

1290
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,960
very much encourage this you can buy a

1291
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,560
tig welder these days for like

1292
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,000
400 500 bucks a plasma cuts super easily

1293
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,680
you could buy a plasma cutter for 150

1294
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,280
bucks if your ticket doesn't come with

1295
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,480
it

1296
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,240
buy yourself a tank of argon get out

1297
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,520
there to the garage and start putting

1298
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,640
together stuff you're going to wreck a

1299
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,240
lot of aluminum first but gosh once you

1300
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,520
can do it you feel like i'm

1301
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,640
just a magician it's awesome um

1302
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,560
it has very high thermal conductivity

1303
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,400
some of the highest out there

1304
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,720
um especially for a cheap material

1305
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,400
that's why you see heat sinks and stuff

1306
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,720
made out of it all the time

1307
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,400
and it has very high electrical

1308
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,680
conductivity which is why they make

1309
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,440
wiring out of it and it's a lot cheaper

1310
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,560
than copper

1311
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
um it comes in extrusions that look kind

1312
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,079
of like this this is one off my white

1313
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:26,560
board

1314
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,000
you can see this is a long shape that's

1315
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,119
the same thing and that means they've

1316
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,960
pushed it through a die while it's still

1317
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,640
molten

1318
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,160
and then you get this long sheet and

1319
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,760
then they just chop it

1320
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,119
and they make these things like this and

1321
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,040
so it's extremely light you can see that

1322
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,760
this is

1323
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,520
thin but it's extremely rigid like i

1324
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,200
cannot i'm i'm not

1325
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,319
not bending it much at all um

1326
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,760
and uh yeah this weighs like nothing you

1327
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,560
know

1328
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,880
um so this is why it's used commonly in

1329
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,760
aerospace

1330
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,599
um because also spotlight in mind yes

1331
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,520
uh no i'm not unmuting later

1332
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,400
i'm already unmuted perfect okay glad

1333
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,520
people could see me sorry

1334
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,119
sorry that was yeah i hope you haven't

1335
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,599
missed all of it um

1336
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,599
and hopefully you can still see the uh

1337
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,960
screen share

1338
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,119
um so aluminum also has this really nice

1339
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,720
self-limiting oxide which means you plop

1340
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,760
it outside i have

1341
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,319
i have one out in front and it's great

1342
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,680
you can leave it outside forever it's

1343
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,560
great

1344
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,880
um the grating system is of course uh

1345
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,680
different uh different from steel um

1346
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,079
because

1347
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,520
it would be too easy if all of these had

1348
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,760
the same grading system um

1349
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,880
but the ones you're going to see out

1350
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,560
there in the real world in the wild

1351
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,480
you're going to see a lot of 6061 this

1352
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,359
is a very common alloy

1353
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,400
and it's extremely easy to machine

1354
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,520
it cuts beautifully um and

1355
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,079
um and it has good dimensional accuracy

1356
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,760
that's not terribly expensive

1357
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,200
uh 6061 t6 refers to

1358
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,880
the tempering grade how it's been

1359
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,359
post-treated after the alloy

1360
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,480
and that one's particularly good for

1361
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,280
machining and there's even a designer

1362
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,480
brand name one called mic

1363
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,240
6 which they've done something extra

1364
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,680
special too and it

1365
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,359
is even easier to machine so if you want

1366
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,280
to machine beautiful parts

1367
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,280
uh 6061 t6 or mic 6 both

1368
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,680
magnificent parts come out here's an

1369
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,119
aluminum part that i machined

1370
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,079
in the mill and so you can see this was

1371
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,920
actually done on a 5-axis machine i

1372
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,280
didn't do a particularly good job of it

1373
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,599
because i just wanted it done quick but

1374
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,760
it's a pretty good way to go for that

1375
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,839
7075 is the one you often hear referred

1376
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,599
to as aircraft aluminum

1377
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,839
it's extremely high strength it's a

1378
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,200
little bit more difficult to machine and

1379
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,000
it's quite quite

1380
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,760
a lot more expensive but if you really

1381
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,960
want something if you want to brag to

1382
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,240
your buddies like i made something out

1383
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,599
of aircraft aluminum

1384
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,880
that's the stuff um that's that's the

1385
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,000
the bragging material right there

1386
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,520
uh what's going on okay copper alloys uh

1387
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,880
copper alloys generally if you're

1388
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,400
working with pure copper it is a real

1389
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,520
pain to

1390
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,079
manufacture stuff out of it's great

1391
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,280
because it has basically

1392
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,160
the highest electrical conductivity and

1393
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,720
thermal conductivity of any workable

1394
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,960
material like gold is officially higher

1395
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,400
but it's so expensive you'd never use it

1396
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,440
to build a thing

1397
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,960
so you have to use copper for those

1398
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,119
sorts of sorts of situations but it's

1399
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,480
kind of a pain

1400
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,000
um to actually manufacture with it it

1401
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,079
does oxidize it patinas with kind of a

1402
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,680
green color which they use a lot of

1403
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,960
times in architectural world because

1404
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,640
it's really quite attractive

1405
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,160
but what happens when machining it is

1406
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,000
that it expands very high thermal

1407
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,800
expansion

1408
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,720
and so as you get it hot from machining

1409
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,560
it expands and then as soon as you stop

1410
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,319
moving your drill bit it contracts it

1411
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,680
traps your drill bit and you snap your

1412
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,720
drill

1413
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,680
um and this is just the number of times

1414
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,319
i have junk

1415
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,440
drill bits trying to drill through

1416
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,520
copper which is a soft material

1417
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,920
it's pain in the butt brass on the other

1418
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,319
hand is extremely easy to machine

1419
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,839
it's dimensionally stable it's even

1420
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,520
easier to machine than aluminum

1421
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,440
um which is why whenever you see someone

1422
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,720
demonstrating their machining product

1423
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,839
they always show it on brass because

1424
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:00,319
they can move

1425
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,520
really fast without coolant and it's

1426
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,000
just like

1427
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,319
awesome you can't choose a material

1428
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,760
better to cut has extremely good

1429
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,119
dimensional stability so if you just

1430
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,480
need something that fits

1431
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,720
make it out of brass it's great um it

1432
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,400
does have pretty high thermal expansion

1433
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,680
so if it needs to be

1434
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,560
over a broad both aluminum and brass

1435
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:18,880
have

1436
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,480
high thermal expansion so if you're

1437
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,240
using it over a variety of temperatures

1438
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,200
you may want to choose a different

1439
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,760
material but you can see here like this

1440
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,960
is a gear

1441
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,520
from a worm drive made out of brass and

1442
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,160
they just

1443
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,160
machined it and it's just gorgeous and

1444
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,800
it fits with this corresponding

1445
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,359
steel one tightly beautifully

1446
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,359
bronze is another really great material

1447
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,119
it's used oftentimes in bearings

1448
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,040
it has a slight porosity to it and so

1449
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,640
they will backfill

1450
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,720
the porosity of it with oil and then

1451
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,560
it's considered self-lubricating and

1452
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,240
that means that you can use

1453
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,280
use it for the life of a bearing kind of

1454
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,960
indefinitely so bronze and brass are

1455
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,640
both copper alloys

1456
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,240
brass with zinc and bronze with tin

1457
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,760
titanium is another really great one i'm

1458
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,280
sorry i don't have a chunk of titanium

1459
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,119
around to show you i've used it on my

1460
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,240
career a whole lot

1461
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,680
it's more expensive than steel or

1462
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,119
aluminum but it has very high strength

1463
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,640
to weight ratio it's used in a lot of

1464
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,680
applications

1465
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,000
um it's a pain in the butt to machine

1466
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,920
because it's kind of gummy and it sticks

1467
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,240
and clogs in your tooling um which is a

1468
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,359
real pain

1469
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,000
and chip clearance is something i'll

1470
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,359
talk about next week but it's

1471
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,280
it's tough for that it's also difficult

1472
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,800
to weld because it tends to react with

1473
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,160
oxygen

1474
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,079
um though once it does it forms this

1475
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,280
very inert

1476
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,280
uh oxide which is why it is so

1477
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,960
biocompatible so if you're building an

1478
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,760
implant

1479
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,760
uh titanium is a great material there

1480
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,359
it's cheaper than other biocompatible

1481
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,000
material metals like platinum and gold

1482
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,520
um it has lower thermal and electrical

1483
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,880
conductivity than kind of your average

1484
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,680
metal

1485
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,119
um for whatever reason um

1486
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,839
it's commonly alloyed with aluminum

1487
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,280
vanadium it also has its own

1488
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,480
numbering system which i'm not going to

1489
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,000
get into that is also completely

1490
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,480
different

1491
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,200
because of course it is um here's a

1492
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,319
couple of other materials that you may

1493
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:04,880
come across

1494
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,560
gold is very pretty very precious

1495
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,960
it's also soft and it has extremely high

1496
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,640
thermal and electrical conductivity top

1497
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,079
of the top of the metal kingdom on that

1498
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:14,800
one

1499
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,960
which is why you see it in high-end uh

1500
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,440
audio equipment all the time

1501
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,880
and in circuitry magnesium is extremely

1502
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,079
light um

1503
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,800
and pretty rigid for its weight you see

1504
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,520
people making

1505
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,800
engine blocks out of it occasionally

1506
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,559
which i always kind of like

1507
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,200
because it's flammable um and magnesium

1508
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:33,839
once lit

1509
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,040
is not really feasible to extinguish

1510
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,359
and so and it burns extremely hot so if

1511
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,440
you don't oil your engine your magnesium

1512
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:41,839
engine

1513
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,000
and friction causes it to light up it's

1514
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,359
going to burn through the bottom of your

1515
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:45,920
car

1516
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,400
and through the pavement as well um this

1517
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,160
is something that magnesium does that's

1518
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,000
kind of exciting

1519
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,599
so just be careful if you find a

1520
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,200
machinist that does magnesium that does

1521
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,240
magnesium machining

1522
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,079
a they are a highly qualified

1523
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,680
professional and you should respect that

1524
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,480
person because

1525
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,760
if they have all of their digits they

1526
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,119
are really really good at what they're

1527
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,280
doing or they've never done it before

1528
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,319
um tungsten is a material you see a lot

1529
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,000
in the welding world because it has

1530
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,680
the highest melting point of any single

1531
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,280
material there are some alloys that have

1532
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,640
higher melting points but

1533
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,200
not really workable it's and it's used

1534
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,040
in welding equipment all the time

1535
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,480
it's extremely difficult to form a

1536
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,200
machine but it can form extremely hard

1537
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,400
uh surfaces in carving and so it's often

1538
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
coated onto things for tooling

1539
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,839
to carve other hard materials so

1540
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,079
tungsten carbide is a commonly used

1541
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,440
coating for

1542
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,359
cutting stainless steel and cutting

1543
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,520
other steel pieces

1544
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,040
lead on the other hand is an extremely

1545
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,520
low melting point which is great because

1546
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,839
you can melt it with a blow torch and

1547
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,200
form it into whatever you want so if you

1548
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,480
would just want a piece of metal

1549
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,319
that's been cast you could do it with

1550
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,400
lead it's toxic

1551
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,440
so be careful don't breathe the fumes

1552
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,520
you heard it here first but it's high

1553
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,800
density so if you need something just to

1554
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,240
be heavy and you need to form it into a

1555
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,760
specific shape

1556
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,280
lead is actually pretty good material

1557
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,040
i've used it before i like it

1558
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,640
and there's a handful of super alloys

1559
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,079
they come in names like inconel and

1560
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:06,880
nitinol

1561
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,200
um nitinol is a nice one because it's

1562
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,079
biocompatible

1563
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,599
um it's a nickel titanium alloy i think

1564
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,720
and it is used in springs a lot um

1565
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,240
if you cut it be careful because it's

1566
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,760
extremely sharp and whip around and

1567
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,520
take you out inkanel is one that's used

1568
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,119
in the drilling industries a lot

1569
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,800
because it's extremely hard which makes

1570
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,359
it very difficult to form

1571
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,640
that's all the metals how we doing on

1572
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,960
time oh shoot i need to be faster all

1573
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,359
right

1574
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,400
plastics let's move um

1575
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,359
cool plastics and polymers uh polymers

1576
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,480
and plastics i'm going to use those

1577
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,319
names interchangeably they're long

1578
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,680
strings of things it's repeated

1579
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,599
molecules covalently bonded to each

1580
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,240
other

1581
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,559
so what you see here is a repeating

1582
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,440
structure

1583
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,960
in the parentheses and that repeats to

1584
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,160
the one next to it through this little

1585
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,359
line so if you imagine those

1586
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,880
h's and c's next to each other they all

1587
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,119
line up in a row they make really long

1588
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,040
ones those things squiggle together like

1589
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,520
this

1590
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,480
then maybe they branch some or they

1591
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,040
branch

1592
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,800
together a whole lot and they're highly

1593
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,319
cross-linked

1594
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,640
that's typical in thermosets this is

1595
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,200
typical of elastomers

1596
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,040
and yeah so what i mean by those things

1597
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,440
um elastomers are things that that that

1598
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,240
stretch

1599
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,520
silicone rubber um

1600
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,200
uh we'll talk more of those um

1601
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,079
nitrile uh examples of all these things

1602
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,119
we'll get to

1603
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,280
um those are all elastomers thermosets

1604
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,480
are things that cure

1605
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,559
wet at higher temperatures so they set

1606
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:33,760
at the thermal

1607
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,760
uh thermoplastics are things that become

1608
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,760
amorphous at temperatures so those melt

1609
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,240
at temperatures um and i'll talk through

1610
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,040
those each

1611
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,720
one by one uh we're going to try and

1612
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,160
cover all of those plastics

1613
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,359
let's get moving um so one of those

1614
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:48,640
common ones out there in fact the most

1615
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,800
common by manufacturing volume

1616
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,480
is polyethylene polyethylene is the

1617
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,079
simplest one from a chemical

1618
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,920
standpoint it's this backbone of carbons

1619
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,520
with a bunch of hydrogens

1620
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,559
we're going to move from simplest

1621
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,640
plastics to more complex so strap

1622
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,440
yourselves in

1623
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,640
with plastics presumably um it's a very

1624
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,280
uh it's typically thermoplastic it's

1625
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,000
chemically

1626
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,240
extremely simple that makes it extremely

1627
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,280
cheap to manufacture

1628
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,960
and it's great for a lot of things you

1629
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,480
see it all over the place

1630
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,599
in injection molded parts like these

1631
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,280
jugs down here those actually may be

1632
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,720
blow molded

1633
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,000
or um uh plastic bags those sorts of

1634
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,280
things you see it extruded

1635
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,280
it's used everywhere you're gonna find

1636
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,319
it out in the world

1637
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,720
it's recycled under the number one uh

1638
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,000
and so whenever you see the recycling

1639
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,599
number and it says one on it

1640
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,640
uh it's it's there um it has high impact

1641
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,599
strength which is nice

1642
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,160
cool uh acetyl is another nice one this

1643
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:40,640
one is

1644
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,480
possibly the easiest material to machine

1645
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,800
ever it's even easier to machine than

1646
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
uh metals and that's why you see people

1647
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,319
making gears and stuff out of it so you

1648
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,640
can see it's chemically a slightly more

1649
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,119
uh more complicated than uh

1650
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,599
than your um polyethylene and that's

1651
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,040
because it's got that oxygen in there

1652
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,400
but it just alternates carbon oxygen

1653
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,000
carbon oxygen carbon oxygen

1654
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,960
it's cheap also it's very good rigidity

1655
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,440
um and

1656
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,280
excellent dimensional stability and low

1657
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,040
friction so it's great in moving parts i

1658
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,880
use it all the time and i love it it's

1659
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,000
great stuff

1660
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,800
uh polypropylene we're getting a little

1661
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,319
more complicated here now your back bona

1662
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:17,680
carbons has another carbon sticking up

1663
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,640
off of it

1664
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,319
wherever you see a bend that's a carbon

1665
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,599
that they just didn't bother putting in

1666
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:22,319
there

1667
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,319
it's a nice flexible one it's used a lot

1668
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,160
of times in these living hinges

1669
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,520
like you see here on the tic tac

1670
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,280
container

1671
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,960
and it's uh also relatively

1672
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,520
inexpensive um it tends to be nice and

1673
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,359
chemical and corrosion resistant

1674
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,359
um and fatigue resistant which is really

1675
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:40,559
important when you're making parts that

1676
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:41,839
are going to move back and forth a whole

1677
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,520
bunch

1678
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,440
nylon is another super common one you

1679
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,280
see that all the time it's your zip tie

1680
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,359
material it's extremely high tensile

1681
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,160
strength

1682
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,440
extremely uncomfortable for tights

1683
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,200
and extremely good for ropes so you see

1684
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,240
it all over the place it's another

1685
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,119
thermoplastic

1686
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,200
cheap common and it's also used in

1687
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,640
composites a fair bit because of that

1688
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,040
high tensile strength

1689
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,800
polycarbonate is one you see around you

1690
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,720
also all the time it's clear

1691
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,920
um and it's extremely resilient um

1692
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,599
and impact resistant so here's my water

1693
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:12,880
bottle i can punch it and not worry

1694
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,000
about shattering it

1695
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,359
that's got a really nice sound to it um

1696
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,599
and uh it's it's a really nice one you

1697
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,520
see also in places where high impact is

1698
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,200
potential so like a motorcycle helmet

1699
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,480
you don't want to shatter

1700
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,240
um when it gets impacted from a piece of

1701
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,480
gravel and so those are often made of

1702
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,480
polycarbonate and you can see now we're

1703
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,240
getting into a much more complicated

1704
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,920
chemical structure these are rings of

1705
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,599
carbons with some extra carbons and

1706
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,359
stuff sticking off and some oxygens in

1707
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,160
there

1708
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,960
cool let's keep rolling um acrylic is

1709
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,000
another one that's

1710
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,839
optically clear this is oftentimes used

1711
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,760
because it is slightly more clear

1712
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,240
um than polycarbonate um you can dye it

1713
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,440
all sorts of fun colors

1714
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,200
it's one that is absolutely magnificent

1715
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,400
to laser cut it cuts beautifully very

1716
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,319
very dimensionally and you can cut thick

1717
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,400
pieces of it really quick

1718
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,680
um it's much more brittle than

1719
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,359
polycarbonate and so it's not as impact

1720
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:02,800
resistant as a result

1721
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,720
um you can machine it and then go back

1722
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,160
and vapor polish it which is where you

1723
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,760
have heated acetone underneath it which

1724
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,839
lightly dissolves it

1725
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:12,319
and then it will cause itself to heal up

1726
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,200
uh and

1727
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,200
become clear again which is super cool

1728
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,119
if you ever want a fun youtube hole go

1729
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,480
watch vapor polishing

1730
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,079
it's magic but in

1731
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,240
machining careful because it is also

1732
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,280
brittle

1733
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,400
um cool other common plastics that you

1734
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,599
see out there in the world

1735
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,359
uh polystyrene is used a lot in food

1736
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:32,800
packaging and foam peanuts

1737
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,280
polyurethane is often foams in fact a

1738
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,640
lot of the memory foam mattresses are

1739
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,440
made of blends of polyurethane

1740
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,440
pvc polyvinyl chloride is used in

1741
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,960
plumbing and rigid applications a lot

1742
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,400
it's nice because it's low friction

1743
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,280
also which is great and acrylic nitrile

1744
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,119
butadiene styrene which is a mouthful

1745
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,839
abbreviated often as abs is used in

1746
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:52,799
legos ah

1747
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,799
my favorite thing in the universe also

1748
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,559
cases and impact and strength you find

1749
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,240
these oftentimes in plastic phone cases

1750
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,400
and that sort of stuff

1751
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,440
let's look at some of your more

1752
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,680
expensive plastics uh teflon which is

1753
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,359
poly tetrafluoroethylene you can see

1754
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,839
looks a lot like polyethylene

1755
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,599
but they put fluorines on the end here

1756
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,359
and the wonderful thing about fluorines

1757
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,040
and carbons is that that bond is one of

1758
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,799
the strongest in nature

1759
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,359
meaning that it's very difficult to pull

1760
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:17,839
apart

1761
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,240
that makes it extremely inert which is

1762
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,280
great

1763
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,119
and so you can use this in extremely

1764
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,480
crazy chemicals

1765
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,799
um things like hydrofluoric acid you do

1766
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,040
in teflon solid teflon beakers

1767
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,280
which is terrifying but i've also done

1768
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,440
that one

1769
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,960
it is machinable but when you clamp it

1770
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,640
it deforms so when you machine a hole

1771
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,799
and you let it go it becomes an ellipse

1772
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:41,839
uh which is not ideal um it's very

1773
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:42,799
expensive i

1774
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,400
once machined a block of it that was

1775
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,720
about this size we paid 270 dollars for

1776
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,880
the block um of raw material

1777
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,720
which is like super expensive stuff but

1778
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,480
it's low friction which is great

1779
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,000
and it's extremely hydrophobic which is

1780
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,359
awesome for cooking and cleaning

1781
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:56,960
afterwards because you can just like

1782
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,119
wipe it right on out also because it's

1783
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,400
this fluorine

1784
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,720
carbon bond it's extremely biocompatible

1785
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,000
so whenever you see those people who

1786
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,359
have like crazy implants

1787
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,440
uh like to make horns into their skin

1788
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,960
and that sort of stuff

1789
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,799
don't google image search that if you're

1790
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,799
weak apart um

1791
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,640
they're typically teflon things that are

1792
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,680
inserted under the surface of their skin

1793
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,960
peak is another great bio one

1794
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,720
biocompatible material it's also

1795
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,400
extremely expensive polyether ether

1796
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,680
ketone you can see they've got those

1797
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,839
nice little

1798
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,400
ether ketones right there bonded to each

1799
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,280
other

1800
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,119
it's a high temperature thermoplastic as

1801
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,200
is teflon so those melt at much higher

1802
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,480
temperatures which means they can use

1803
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,000
in thermal applications this is possibly

1804
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,280
as machinable as acetyl and that's

1805
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,160
really nice because you can get these

1806
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,760
dimensionally stable things for bio

1807
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,960
applications

1808
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,440
um it's also extremely chemically inert

1809
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,160
because of those nice ring structures

1810
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,240
epoxies are another really nice one i've

1811
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,920
got your example right here oftentimes

1812
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,400
you see this as adhesives

1813
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,760
and they're really nice but they can

1814
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,160
also be used for self-leveling flooring

1815
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,960
they're also used oftentimes as a binder

1816
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:05,280
for

1817
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,000
composites that's a thermoset we finally

1818
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,040
made our way all the way through all the

1819
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,559
thermoplastics the thermosets that means

1820
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,400
you mix two parts of it together

1821
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,559
you mix them and then it cures and

1822
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,400
becomes hard

1823
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,640
the same is true for most elastomers

1824
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,799
they tend to be thermosets also

1825
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,400
in that case it's called vulcanizing

1826
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,920
because it comes from the rubber world

1827
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,200
which is a natural

1828
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,000
elastomer they are bendy stretchy and

1829
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,880
rubbery

1830
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,119
you can make all sorts of wiggly wiggly

1831
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,880
things out of them

1832
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,240
and they are measured typically in

1833
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,720
durometers so this pourable silicone

1834
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,839
is a 22a durometer um there's my two

1835
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,680
parts of it whereas this which is the

1836
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,200
foot to my thing uh is like a 50 or 60

1837
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,400
durometer

1838
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,880
thing and that is kind of how rubbery it

1839
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,720
is that's how much it deflects

1840
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,000
when uh done and it's uh that

1841
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,280
kind of rubberiness as a capacity

1842
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,960
lower is rubberier higher is more stiff

1843
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,319
silicone is a material that's used out

1844
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:03,520
there all the time it's a synthetic

1845
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,079
rubber

1846
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,839
um it's like uh like your polypropylene

1847
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:09,920
except using silicons instead of carbons

1848
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,359
uh the nice thing about it is it's

1849
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,440
extremely food safe it has a very high

1850
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,880
melting

1851
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,920
uh melting point uh like thermal

1852
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,760
problems so you can use it when cooking

1853
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,040
and it's got that kind of like

1854
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,480
wobbliness to it for things like

1855
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,480
spatulas it's also got really good

1856
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,680
chemical resistance

1857
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,440
um and it's bio-compatible which is

1858
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,520
great you see it all the time in

1859
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,760
things like uh ports and that sort of

1860
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,799
stuff

1861
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,559
you can buy it off the shelf as room

1862
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,079
temperature vulcanization rtv

1863
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,760
which is what this stuff is and then you

1864
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,000
can pour it into molds or mold make with

1865
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,400
it

1866
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,559
to do that um cool

1867
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,160
sorry i'm moving super fast nitrile is

1868
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,280
another one you can see the chemical

1869
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,359
formula up there it's a little bit crazy

1870
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,799
you find it most commonly in things like

1871
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,720
gloves which is nice it's

1872
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,559
very chemically resistant also resistant

1873
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,480
to fuel and oil sometimes you see it

1874
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,839
called buna or buna n

1875
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,920
in the case of gaskets and it can be

1876
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,280
self-healing which is really nice if

1877
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,640
you're using a fuel application you

1878
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,559
don't use fuel to dissolve your

1879
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,000
your thing um cool

1880
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,760
sorry i'm moving so fast i'm seeing some

1881
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,119
of the chat come up there

1882
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,440
uh you have natural rubber which is also

1883
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,400
an elastomer

1884
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,839
it's cheap and has excellent excellent

1885
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:18,240
rubberiness um

1886
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,079
because it's rubber viton is another one

1887
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,160
that's a fluoroelastomer and that one's

1888
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,960
extremely chemical resistant

1889
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,720
but expensive so you can use that in

1890
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,160
sealing applications when you're piping

1891
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,559
around

1892
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,680
terrifying and dangerous chemicals

1893
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,440
there's a picture of rubber being taken

1894
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,640
out of the tree because it's a natural

1895
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,280
thing

1896
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,280
it's from the sap all right i have uh

1897
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,480
literally

1898
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,079
uh very fast go through of ceramics

1899
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,880
the one slide which is kind of a lie um

1900
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,240
so typical engineering ceramics are

1901
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,839
alumina and silica that means aluminum

1902
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,440
oxide and silicon oxide

1903
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,400
um and those are difficult to fabricate

1904
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,680
you usually have to grind them to

1905
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,200
fabricate them

1906
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,720
they can be ground and polished they

1907
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,960
have extremely good chemical resistance

1908
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,079
they tend to be very good thermal

1909
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,160
insulators and electrical insulators but

1910
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,280
they're high density

1911
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,880
and they're brittle so they tend to

1912
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,799
crack and break as you would think of

1913
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,160
kind of commonly when you think of

1914
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,160
ceramics

1915
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,760
another thing that's almost a ceramic is

1916
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,040
glass you use this in a lot of

1917
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,559
situations technically it's not a

1918
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:16,079
ceramic because it's an amorphous solid

1919
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,280
that means that it has a tendency to

1920
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,000
flow

1921
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,559
except extremely slowly um so you don't

1922
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,079
necessarily notice it

1923
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,240
um it's extremely difficult to fabricate

1924
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,119
after molten

1925
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,960
because it has that tendency to fracture

1926
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,799
brittlely

1927
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,359
most glass is soda lime glass it's

1928
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,400
silica based

1929
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,000
which is made from melted sand as you

1930
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,319
may know you can also make it with

1931
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,480
borosilicate meaning you're adding boron

1932
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,520
in and that makes it

1933
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,520
uh stronger more resilient you can get

1934
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,880
designer glasses uh

1935
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,960
tempered glass gorilla glass

1936
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,240
shatterproof glass all those sorts of

1937
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,920
things

1938
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,920
also i would love to go into more detail

1939
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,359
on that and also i'd love to have that

1940
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:54,000
glass of old fashioned

1941
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,359
now we'll touch the final bit on

1942
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,359
composites i know i'm over time and i'm

1943
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,119
moving really fast i'm sorry i should

1944
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,520
have sped things up at the beginning

1945
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,440
um composites and other materials

1946
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,040
typically are a matrix in a binder in

1947
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:05,839
the case of me

1948
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:08,480
as shown there i am a matrix of bones

1949
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,720
with a binder of flesh

1950
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,000
and that's what keeps me from falling

1951
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,480
into a discrete pile

1952
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,079
some other examples of this are wood

1953
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,760
carbon fiber fiberglass

1954
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,960
textiles concrete and paper products

1955
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,799
so we'll go through those really really

1956
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,799
fast wood is a nice one because it's

1957
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:25,680
eco-friendly

1958
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,480
um it's very cheap you can do really

1959
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,599
impressive stuff with it like you could

1960
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,680
see some gearing in there made from wood

1961
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,680
it always blows my mind when people make

1962
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,119
such precise things

1963
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,319
out of wood but uh it's very easy to cut

1964
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,079
it's much more difficult to injection

1965
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,480
mold wood um

1966
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,240
in fact i don't know if it can be done

1967
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,319
and the strength varies greatly

1968
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:49,119
on species grains direction and that

1969
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,240
sort of stuff so sometimes you have

1970
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,680
something that's extremely strong

1971
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,880
with grain but very weak against grain

1972
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,000
um and the differences are vast between

1973
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,839
species um it tends to be hydrophilic

1974
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,200
which means it will absorb

1975
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,680
moisture um and porous so you should

1976
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,280
seal it before using in contact with

1977
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,240
liquids

1978
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,839
unless you want your liquids to be in

1979
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,839
whiskey in which case

1980
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:13,520
don't seal it um carbon fiber and

1981
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,440
fiberglass just one slide on these again

1982
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,000
this is an entire career in one slide

1983
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,400
it's extremely lightweight and extremely

1984
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,039
rigid

1985
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,720
um i actually have some carbon carbon

1986
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,640
fiber rod here and you can see i can put

1987
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,640
a fair bit of thing on it's just bending

1988
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,079
a little bit and this thing is like

1989
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,960
hollow and tiny and it weighs just like

1990
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,960
less than a soda straw

1991
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,200
um it tends to be quite expensive for

1992
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,319
what you get

1993
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:39,200
by weight um and it's a real pain to

1994
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:39,920
form

1995
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,240
um fiberglass additionally if your saw

1996
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,920
and stuff like always wear

1997
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,039
breathing protection when you're working

1998
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,480
around these things those little carbon

1999
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,000
fibers get into your lungs and they are

2000
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,720
not good for you

2001
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,720
textiles just want to touch briefly they

2002
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,799
are a perfectly viable engineering

2003
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:57,599
material they are fibrous things woven

2004
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:58,079
together

2005
01:02:58,079 --> 01:02:59,920
it can be natural fiber synthetic fibers

2006
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,160
or both they tend to be very strong in

2007
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,119
tension

2008
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,720
except very flexible so it's very

2009
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,240
difficult to build a bridge out of just

2010
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,079
tension

2011
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,160
um tends to be pretty easy to cut um and

2012
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,680
they tend to be extremely hydrophilic

2013
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,960
because that cross weave

2014
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,319
uh the surface tension and water will

2015
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:18,400
cause to cause it to soak right in

2016
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:21,200
um concrete is another one this one's

2017
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,640
used a lot more in kind of a civil

2018
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,000
engineering world you just find it

2019
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,440
occasionally in mechanical engineering

2020
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,799
it's really nice because it's extremely

2021
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,559
high density meaning heavy

2022
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,160
and it's extremely cheap for the volume

2023
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,599
you get um

2024
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,440
you can go out and buy a big big bag of

2025
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,640
concrete mix it up in your

2026
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,559
in your quick create in your in your

2027
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,240
driveway and have a bunch of it

2028
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,240
it's moldable um but difficult to

2029
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,440
fabricate after

2030
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,400
uh you poured it and it's set tends to

2031
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,760
be pretty wear resistant

2032
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,520
and you can seal it and paint it to keep

2033
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,520
water from infiltrating otherwise

2034
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,720
it can be slightly hydrophilic paper

2035
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,160
products are really cool never discount

2036
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,520
these when you're prototyping i build

2037
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,200
stuff out of cardboard all the time

2038
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,720
because it's basically free

2039
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,400
you can find cardboard anywhere cuts

2040
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,480
easily with a razor blade or a knife

2041
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,839
you can make all sorts of stuff paper

2042
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,440
mache is another really cool material i

2043
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,720
don't use that one quite as much but

2044
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,680
it's nice if you need to build an

2045
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,960
aesthetic mock-up of something that's

2046
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,119
relatively big

2047
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,680
and it'll hold paint uh paper products

2048
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,200
tend to be really easy to laser cut and

2049
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:15,599
cut

2050
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,599
form um and they can be shredded you can

2051
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:18,720
even mold them

2052
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,319
uh by shredding them first and then

2053
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:22,240
applying binder into them

2054
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,640
they tend to be quite hydrophilic that's

2055
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,440
why you use them for napkins

2056
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,839
cool there we are i'm sorry i had to

2057
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:31,440
rush that last little bit wish i'd paced

2058
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,880
myself a little bit better but now i

2059
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,760
know

2060
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,839
um remember last week i talked about

2061
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,520
engineering about humility but it's also

2062
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,200
about curiosity

2063
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,880
the best of all of this stuff is to get

2064
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,559
curious from these slides and go out and

2065
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:43,760
teach yourself

2066
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,720
the next steps so uh thank you guys i

2067
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:47,119
just

2068
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,319
last week you guys asked for some

2069
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:49,440
resources to check out i'm going to

2070
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,280
leave these up during you know it is q a

2071
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,000
time

2072
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,839
um but i'm going to leave those up
