hi

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,840
i'm marie and do you know this little

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,719
fella

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,559
yes that's the new pie pickle from

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,640
raspberry pi it's tiny but

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,119
capable and just like you i was super

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,960
excited when it was launched earlier

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,760
this year

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,920
so i immediately went to download the

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,359
datasheet the sdk

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,519
and all the code examples and started

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,800
digging in

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,960
and so how can you and i partnered to

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,238
bring you this new class

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,520
about the rb2040 that's the brands of

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:35,920
this

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,640
new pipe eco together we are going to

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,000
study the data sheet

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,640
learn the basics of arm you know the

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,640
assembly architecture

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,440
and also talk about pio that's

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,800
programmable io

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,239
which is a unique feature for the rp2040

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,399
and of course we'll get our hands dirty

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,160
with writing some code

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,280
and also become good friends with the

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,399
gdp debugger it's all going to be

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,559
very intense don't say i haven't warned

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,479
you oh by the way

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,119
um i'm writing an emulator for this chip

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,119
so you will be able to participate in

33
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:11,600
class

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,439
even if you don't have the actual

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,520
hardware alright so

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,439
i hope you will join us and let's hack

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,479
some fun together

38
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,520
bye
