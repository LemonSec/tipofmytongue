2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,080
let's get started

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,359
okay so a little bit laggy but

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,560
we should be okay and welcome to

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,680
session seven so again

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,920
for people who who know just bear with

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,800
me for a sec

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,880
this is where we have everything and

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,039
brian has already also posted a link to

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,040
hackaday projects

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,399
before i get started with today's topic

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,399
again congrats to the people who

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,399
submitted the katas

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,239
to get the first certificate and i got a

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,160
couple

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,760
really nice results tweeted

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,480
and just for people who missed it last

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,520
time

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,360
we are doing a certificate give out

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,320
which is this vector graphic where you

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,280
can use to

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,400
print out anything you want and is kind

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,720
of

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,840
a hacked schrodinger's cat

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,280
and all you need to do is to find a

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,000
quantum catalyst and then do a

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,880
screenshot

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,240
that you finished a whole set of

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,799
cards then post it on either twitter or

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,960
linkedin you will get this

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,320
of course you need to tag these accounts

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,520
and hashtags so that i will know

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,200
so today's topic is on algorithms

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,640
we start with the simplest the

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,880
earliest one of the earliest algorithm

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
which is deutsche's algorithm

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,240
so these are a set of algorithms that

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,920
are really class classically taught

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,640
in academics so in academia

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,240
they were developed in the past

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,759
couple decades and there were

42
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,119
early algorithms that

43
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,920
scientists were able to show the

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,799
specific

45
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,038
improvement compared to classical

46
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,160
algorithm for

47
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,680
specific tasks so the

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
deutsche aurism what it's trying to

49
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,360
solve is

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,640
to figure out if a function is balanced

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,960
or constant balance just means that

52
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,440
[Music]

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,760
is not a two to one

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,400
function is one to one so one input

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,040
gives out

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,080
one output and there's no

57
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,920
repeated ambiguous result

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,200
when a function is constant is a two to

59
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,920
one so

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,519
here is saying no matter what input you

61
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,800
give

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,959
you get the same value so either your

63
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,920
function output one or either is zero

64
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,840
so don't worry that uh right now i'm

65
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,000
just giving a short intro

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,480
if anything sounds confusing we're gonna

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,080
answer that later

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,840
and deutsche hosa is a expanded

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,120
deutsche algorithm for n-qubits

70
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,319
and later on you also see some of the

71
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,159
more complex

72
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,560
algorithms that also tend to be more

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,800
useful so gruver's algorithm is

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,000
a search algorithm for

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,200
ordered list and then also the

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,159
schwarz algorithm you would use to

77
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,760
factorize really large

78
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,799
numbers so

79
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,599
there are not a lot of quantum

80
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,720
algorithms

81
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,319
that are distinctly different these are

82
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,200
some of the examples that are doing

83
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,480
different things

84
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,599
and most of the later algorithms

85
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,480
are developed based on those here is a

86
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,840
link where you can find

87
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,560
all kinds of other algorithms and i hope

88
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,840
that by

89
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,280
your self-study of quantum computing

90
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,760
you will be able to come up with more

91
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,159
useful algorithms in the future

92
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,599
and also a lot of these are academic

93
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,480
and we need a lot more large-scale

94
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,599
industry

95
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,959
solutions so keep that in mind

96
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,680
while you learn these historic

97
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,478
algorithms

98
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,600
but also the industry really needs more

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
interesting and useful ones

100
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,759
before we go to the algorithm there's a

101
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,800
concept called

102
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,080
articles i i very perplexed

103
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,320
why are we called why do we call these

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
things oracles

105
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
like i was trying to look up um the

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
definition of oracles

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,360
so there's also there's the theological

108
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
definition uh so that's what is

109
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,000
cartoon is trying to show but also in

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,680
quantum computing we have

111
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,840
this uh quantum oracles

112
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,240
that basically a black box

113
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,320
and there are also a lot of different

114
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,600
ways to define it

115
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,840
is sometimes people say it's an

116
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,680
operation that is used as

117
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,759
input to another algorithm sometimes

118
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,199
people say

119
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,280
represent classical functions that

120
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,479
return real numbers

121
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,280
instead of only a single bit there's

122
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,199
also definitions saying quantum

123
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,160
operations

124
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,479
which implement certain classical

125
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,520
functions

126
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,600
these are just words and is not

127
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,960
that useful so let's turn them

128
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,840
into more intuitive pictures

129
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,919
a classical algorithm looks like this

130
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,600
where it takes

131
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
some inputs and then you apply a

132
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,880
function to

133
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,880
the input and you get an output y

134
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,919
a quantum algorithm cannot use

135
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,120
this kind of setup because this has no

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,400
guarantee that

137
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,840
this function f of x is reversible

138
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,800
and we introduced reversibility when we

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,479
were talking about gates when you're

140
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,280
applying an

141
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,160
operation onto your qubits you need to

142
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,400
make sure that they can reverse back

143
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,840
so this algorithm setup

144
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,680
wouldn't be useful for

145
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,880
quantum so instead in quantum algorithms

146
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,360
we

147
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,160
build a setup like this where your

148
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,600
inputs

149
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,120
are encoded into these qubits

150
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,560
and also this output qubit y also goes

151
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,520
through this

152
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,639
black box you will get

153
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,919
your input cubits out through the box

154
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,080
and also your y qubit would become

155
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,759
this y with a control

156
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,120
knot with f of x

157
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,160
what does that also show

158
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,199
this is trying to give

159
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,800
you a proof that you cannot

160
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,240
set up a quantum algorithm like this

161
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,400
for example in this case

162
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,599
if y is your f of x

163
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,520
and you can have all these inputs of x

164
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,560
but it has

165
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,520
a period it goes from zero one two three

166
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
and then repeats

167
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,319
so in this case you can get a f

168
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,039
of x but then you cannot reverse back if

169
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:27,680
you say

170
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,800
you have a value of three

171
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,520
you don't know if your eggs start to

172
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,560
with a three or

173
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,599
a seven so here is just trying to show

174
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:37,919
you

175
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,120
that instead if you write your

176
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,160
oracle black box in this way then you

177
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,080
can get a reverse

178
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,039
i wouldn't spend too much time showing

179
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,960
you the derivation but i'm

180
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,120
keeping these slides here for you to

181
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
look at later

182
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
so this is just trying to show you that

183
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,720
if you set up your

184
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,520
circuit like this it would work and it

185
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,919
would be able to reverse back

186
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,879
if you do two of them in series you get

187
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,759
your initial

188
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,280
inputs back to before

189
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,199
so don't worry about this too much this

190
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,120
is just showing you that

191
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,479
um in quantum algorithms uh a lot of

192
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:18,879
them

193
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,360
so i've showed you like teleportation

194
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,639
algorithm before we didn't

195
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,479
need oracle but a lot of those

196
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,520
future later articles later

197
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,120
algorithms that they need oracles

198
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,159
and this f of x is this classical

199
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,440
function that we can

200
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,480
get out of this

201
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,279
black box and it is also used to

202
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,240
construct

203
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,000
this black box so let's just

204
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,120
look at an actual example this deutsch

205
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,760
hosa

206
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,680
algorithm then and that's constructed by

207
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,320
physicist david deutsch and

208
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,680
mathematician

209
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,360
richard hosa at first sight it seemed to

210
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,880
be a very complex

211
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,480
circuit you have a bunch of input qubits

212
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,360
and you apply hardama gates onto all of

213
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,959
them

214
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,320
and also when you input those qubits

215
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,600
they all initialize to zero

216
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,800
so even including your your

217
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,040
input of the oracle which is your

218
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,959
classical output y

219
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,160
is encoded into this qubit and it

220
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,959
is also starting at zero but then you do

221
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:37,279
a

222
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,560
flip this x gate that

223
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,519
change it to one and do again a hard

224
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,720
omega

225
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
then you throw all of these into this

226
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,240
black box

227
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,920
when it comes out you

228
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,279
do a measurement of

229
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,640
those input x cubits

230
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,040
and then you would know what your

231
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,920
function f of

232
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,959
x would be so what deutsche holzer

233
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,800
algorithm does

234
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,839
is to find out if a function

235
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,760
f of x is constant which means

236
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,800
f of x is either 0 or 1

237
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,000
for any given x so

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,200
constant 0 or constant 1. or

239
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,000
f of x could be balanced which means

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,120
half of the time

241
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,640
f of x gives you output of 0 and half of

242
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,760
the time

243
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,800
it gives you output one this is the

244
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,360
setup

245
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,839
for this algorithms it does nothing else

246
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,959
it just

247
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,800
tells us if a con if a function is

248
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,959
constant or balance it doesn't even tell

249
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,440
you exactly what f of x

250
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,720
is but what this algorithm does is to

251
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,519
tell you

252
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,959
uh the nature of f of x

253
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,839
if you want to do this classically you

254
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,440
will have to

255
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,640
test every single output

256
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,160
given every single input so you need to

257
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,279
run your algorithm n times

258
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,399
if you have n numbers but in this

259
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
case with even with n qubits you just

260
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,279
need to run your algorithm

261
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,079
once and do the measurement for all

262
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,839
these qubits you will get

263
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,279
the answer so this is what it does

264
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,480
much better than classically

265
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,480
a recap what is each gate

266
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,760
in case you forgot the h

267
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,200
gate brings a 0 or 1

268
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,320
to this intermediate state that is a

269
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,000
superposition of 0 and 1.

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,040
what is a c not gate it's

271
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,639
i haven't shown you a c not gate in

272
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,800
deutsche hoser

273
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,200
black box yet but there is a c naught

274
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,079
and what it does

275
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,120
is to change the second qubit

276
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,240
based on the first qubit and what does

277
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,079
h and the c naught together do

278
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,720
remember we discussed entanglement

279
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,480
before

280
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,760
you would build a entanglement

281
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,800
between these two cubes when you have a

282
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,360
h

283
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,800
and a c naught so intuitively what

284
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,880
deutsche hauser auxin is doing

285
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,240
you are starting with some pure zero

286
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,920
zero qubit state

287
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,360
and each gate will change

288
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,880
all of them into a superposition of zero

289
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,720
and once and then this last qubit comes

290
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,760
in

291
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,240
it started with zero but then when you

292
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,600
do a axe gate

293
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,760
on it it would bring this negative sign

294
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,279
into your system because each

295
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,399
gate applied to a

296
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,240
1 state is the minus state

297
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,720
and then this black box is set up

298
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,000
so that if f of x

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,200
is constant your oracle actually does

300
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,560
nothing to your

301
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,680
input qubits these qubits here

302
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,320
so if that's the case then when it goes

303
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,720
out of the black box nothing is changed

304
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,760
so applying a h gate to them

305
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,279
will bring them back to where they

306
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,279
started so all of the outputs will be

307
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,399
zero

308
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,839
however if you want your black box

309
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,680
to have this balanced function

310
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,639
then what it is doing is it actually

311
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,600
entangles this qubit

312
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,120
this state with any of the

313
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,480
the other state so this then

314
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,760
entanglement allows you to carry this

315
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,839
negative sign

316
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,320
over to your

317
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,560
output of the oracle

318
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,839
and turns out that because this negative

319
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,639
sign brought by this last qubit here

320
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,680
half of the time you would have

321
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,199
a positive amplitude for

322
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
all of the states being zero but half of

323
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,279
the time it will have a negative

324
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,160
amplitude

325
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,000
so in fact what this

326
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,399
black box did if the

327
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,360
function is balanced is that it creates

328
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,079
this

329
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,440
destructive interference for

330
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,040
these states preserving

331
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,880
so the output if you measure

332
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,240
zero zero zero zero and if they are all

333
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,120
zero

334
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,760
that tells you your cons your function

335
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,120
is constant

336
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,639
but if you measure any of those qubits

337
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,360
being one

338
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,560
if there's just you will

339
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,000
one one state

340
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,199
you will know that your function is

341
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,560
balanced um i know

342
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,560
this is usually quite confusing

343
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,160
to fir when people first see it

344
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,839
let's take another example just

345
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,519
because we have so many qubits here

346
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,160
the mathematics can get very lengthy

347
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,560
let's

348
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,160
reduce it down to the deutsche algorithm

349
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,480
where we only have one input qubit

350
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,600
so this is

351
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,800
what deutsche algorithm does is trying

352
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,600
to find

353
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,440
there are only two options now only two

354
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,519
qubits involved

355
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,839
if a function is balanced

356
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,360
it's either when x is 0

357
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,399
it gets f of x to 0

358
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
1 to 1 or 0 becomes 1

359
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,240
1 becomes 0. this is balance this is a

360
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,360
one to one

361
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,480
function but if it is constant

362
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,759
say is always becoming zero

363
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,000
no matter your input or it always

364
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,279
becomes one

365
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,320
both cases are telling you the

366
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,519
function is constant yes

367
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,000
is there a question yeah i said you are

368
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,560
frozen

369
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,880
or you were proven a second ago for the

370
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,120
whole

371
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,240
oh we usually yeah i would present for

372
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
half an hour and then

373
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,519
we can have discussions and questions

374
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,240
after is that okay

375
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,000
yeah i was just saying your screen was

376
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,240
frozen oh it is

377
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,680
yeah which oh it's fine okay thank you

378
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,880
yeah yeah it's a little laggy i think

379
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,639
next time i probably won't you

380
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,799
won't use this again let's see

381
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,359
so if you want to figure this out

382
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,640
classically you have to test

383
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,120
each step you need to do one

384
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,039
run of your classical algorithm and then

385
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,919
see what your

386
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,959
end result is if it is in this case

387
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,319
what happens next

388
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,200
you have to evaluate all of your

389
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,039
possibilities

390
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,360
but as i mentioned earlier if we turn it

391
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,559
into a quantum algorithm

392
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,320
they would not need to be measured

393
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,039
they will not need to be run n times

394
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,919
so the deutsche algorithm is just a two

395
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,799
qubit version of deutsch hosa algorithm

396
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,480
so we would reduce this circuit into

397
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,760
this below circuit only

398
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,400
two qubits involved so that's much

399
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,360
easier to

400
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
follow and see what happens with the

401
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,678
math

402
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,000
okay so the deutsche algorithm

403
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,600
is trying to find out if the function f

404
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,160
of x

405
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,679
is constant or balanced and in fact

406
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,559
in here you would replace it with a

407
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,160
quantum algorithm that has

408
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,120
oracle in it so you need to build a

409
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,000
oracle

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,520
based on the different possibilities of

411
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,280
f of x

412
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,400
let's see step by step

413
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,160
you can construct these four

414
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,080
possibilities so classically you have

415
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,960
um constant zero so f of x is zero

416
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,400
constant one f of x

417
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,840
is one if it's balanced but same

418
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,400
is f of x will equal to x

419
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,720
but if it is balance reverse you will

420
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,840
have a reverse of

421
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,039
x so these are the four

422
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,640
probabilities and you can

423
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,440
write a truth table this is how a

424
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,400
constant

425
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,440
with x would look like but then now

426
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,120
we're dealing with

427
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,840
quantum algorithm you need to even

428
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,960
expand it

429
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,679
to further

430
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,400
your truth table will have all these

431
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,120
pros

432
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,160
possibilities written out so if your

433
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,640
x is zero your y could be zero or one

434
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,799
and similarly with x is one

435
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,080
you have two possible y values

436
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,760
and then you just write out okay

437
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,240
constant is constant zero then all of

438
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,679
the x is zero

439
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,840
and then you calculate what y

440
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,559
c naught or control y is the control and

441
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,440
f of x

442
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,960
is target you will know that

443
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,840
if y is zero

444
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,960
f of x this

445
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,159
overall is zero if y is one

446
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,840
this result is one so you just do this

447
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,879
calculation so

448
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,320
you see that this here is exactly the

449
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,120
same as

450
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,480
as y so then in this quantum

451
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,919
article here we do nothing we just let

452
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,039
the

453
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,280
the cubits pass through without doing

454
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,520
making any gates

455
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,640
but if you had a constant one you will

456
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,120
notice that

457
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,960
is the opposite to y so all of these

458
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,080
cubits got flipped for for y then you

459
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,280
know okay i'm gonna

460
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,720
put a x gate to

461
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,880
this second qubit to get this kind of

462
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,960
truth table but if it's balanced

463
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,000
which means half of the time it will

464
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,480
have

465
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,000
zero and half of time is one

466
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,120
you you see that you would be able to

467
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,840
get

468
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,200
this value if you had a c

469
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,159
naught in between these qubits so you

470
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,039
can just

471
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,960
try to construct this truth table

472
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,720
and you will see that this is what you

473
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,640
need to do

474
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,159
with balance reverse you is

475
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,000
same there but then you need to flip the

476
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
qubit

477
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,640
so you put an x there

478
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,640
the significance here is that

479
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,679
you see that if the function is

480
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,520
if they were constant either constant

481
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,159
zero are one

482
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,919
there's no interaction between the two

483
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,320
qubits inside the oracle

484
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,320
but if your function is balanced

485
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,000
you have this uh c naught

486
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,360
in between them you you connect it to

487
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,840
the

488
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,480
two qubits inside the black box

489
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,280
you can for sure write all of the

490
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,480
steps out in mathematics and i will

491
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,039
highly recommend you do that at home

492
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,080
to realize it looks difficult

493
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,360
but turnout is very very easy so

494
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,240
you should try going through the math

495
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,000
and try to reproduce it

496
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,960
on your own to realize how this is done

497
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,159
mathematically

498
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,840
so one way to study quantum computing

499
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,799
is that people say shut up and calculate

500
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,480
so you will get

501
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,640
you understand mathematically how it

502
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,159
works

503
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,200
and that is my language and i i like

504
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,240
doing this but it's not always the same

505
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,520
for everyone

506
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,600
and intuitively this is intimidating

507
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,640
so what we can do

508
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,320
is just intuitively looking at

509
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,799
those gates as i mentioned for deutsche

510
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,559
holzer earlier

511
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,840
is that all you are doing

512
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,880
is to make your state

513
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,000
into a superposition and then introduce

514
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,280
a negative sign then based on

515
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,799
your oracle setup you will either get

516
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,159
your output 0 or your 0 will be

517
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,200
cancelled out

518
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,240
so you will get 1 as your output and

519
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,120
those two cases correspond to function

520
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,240
being constant

521
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,600
or balanced and i can even write this

522
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:43,919
out

523
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,440
more for you here i made a note here

524
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,400
for myself to not forget is

525
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,799
[Music]

526
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,240
try to write out the steps

527
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,600
so this x

528
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,679
plus one is this here when your

529
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,039
first qubit got h gate on it

530
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,000
and now you are combining your system

531
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,960
with

532
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,080
a a minus state

533
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,080
which is from your y here

534
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,159
and then what happens uh through this

535
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,520
black box

536
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,480
so first you need to expand this you

537
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,360
will get

538
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
a positive zero zero

539
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,400
and then a negative

540
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,679
0 1 positive 1 0

541
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,720
and negative 1 1.

542
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,039
okay is i'm writing with my finger here

543
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,960
it's not very pretty

544
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,840
stop uh my computer stopped recognizing

545
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,679
my pen

546
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,679
um so then what happens

547
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,080
after you go through say

548
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,960
i pick a balance state just to prove the

549
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,279
point

550
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,400
and what that truth table

551
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,080
earlier told me if i used

552
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,120
this balanced

553
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,720
same truth table

554
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,080
then what is doing is based on

555
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,360
my x i would change y

556
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,520
accordingly so this would then becomes

557
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,279
0 0 nothing changes

558
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,039
minus 0 1 nothing changes because

559
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,679
the first cube is 0 but then your second

560
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,640
one will become

561
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,840
1 1 so this amplitude becomes

562
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,080
positive and then the last one is

563
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,720
one zero

564
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,120
then what's happening is that

565
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,000
you have these interference negative

566
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,240
amplitudes here so it will bring

567
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,840
destructive interference so

568
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,879
if you want your first qubit to be

569
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
zero

570
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,200
and then your first qubit

571
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,840
to be one

572
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,520
oh actually it doesn't really

573
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,880
matter so

574
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,960
because the first qubits you want to put

575
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,720
it into a state where it is a

576
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,840
superposition

577
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,120
so that you can uh do a h

578
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,600
to it to figure out if it is zero or one

579
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,520
so you would actually want to look at

580
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,679
your first qubit being 0 and 1 there

581
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,000
so this gives you a

582
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,440
positive state

583
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,240
and

584
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,279
this one will give you

585
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,440
a negative state

586
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,000
and then similarly looking at this qubit

587
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,840
here

588
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,000
this will give you a negative

589
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,559
state and this will give you

590
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,880
a minus positive state

591
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,760
so what's happening here is this the

592
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,320
amplitude for the positive states

593
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,679
are destructively interfering so

594
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,080
as a result they would cancel each other

595
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,279
out

596
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,399
and all you're left with is this

597
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,919
minus state and then when you do a

598
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,159
h to it you would then obtain

599
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,520
your state one so

600
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,880
turns out that there's no

601
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,320
possibility of obtaining zero when you

602
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,840
measure your first

603
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,760
state if your

604
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,960
function is balanced so this is the

605
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,640
exercise you should try to do at home

606
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,679
to try the other cases

607
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,240
the intuition i want people to establish

608
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,120
here is

609
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,039
to understand that when this

610
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,080
negative sign gets introduced if it

611
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,840
interacts with your other

612
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,960
one of the other qubits and because of

613
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,760
the h

614
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,000
here and the c knot here you are

615
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,520
essentially entangling

616
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,159
the two qubits inside this article then

617
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,679
your output

618
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,799
would cancel you will have half of the

619
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,760
time that

620
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,279
the zero amp zeroes amplitude would be

621
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,520
positive and half the time negative so

622
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,120
you canceled

623
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,320
you destructively interfere them

624
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,600
but then if you don't mix those two

625
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,880
cubits you don't

626
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,240
make them interact then the

627
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,720
top qubit will just come out without

628
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,240
being ordered

629
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,279
so in both constant case you will get

630
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,720
your output being zero this is what

631
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,520
deutsch

632
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,559
and deutsche hosa algorithms do that's

633
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,120
all he's

634
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,679
trying to figure out is the nature of

635
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,799
the function

636
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,799
so it's not a super useful

637
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,880
algorithm we don't use it anywhere

638
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,919
however it

639
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,440
is a very cool demonstration to show you

640
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,960
this

641
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,600
powerful effect when you have both

642
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,840
superposition interference

643
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,919
and entanglement involved in your

644
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,679
algorithm so

645
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,159
classically you will have to run your

646
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,120
system

647
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,320
multiple times but then quantum

648
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,159
you know quantum wise you just need to

649
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,320
run your algorithm once

650
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,279
so there are a couple of exercises

651
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,000
that's related to today's topic

652
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,039
you should look up on the

653
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,559
um quantum cutters

654
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,480
and cutters also has two options

655
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,559
it has its own deutsche hosa algorithm

656
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,320
cadas but it also has a tutorial

657
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,000
option where it shows you

658
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,320
some of the details so there's the

659
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,919
deutsche hosa you should try

660
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,919
out there's also the

661
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,000
tutorials which has a more

662
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,360
explained step by step sorry

663
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,399
previous so

664
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,600
i would recommend people go back and try

665
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,640
these

666
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,480
which will help you understand what we

667
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,399
discussed today

668
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,080
and another place you can look up

669
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,080
is in the documentation page

670
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,000
the microsoft's documentation site

671
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,679
we have the samples

672
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,240
inside the documentation and you can

673
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,960
download

674
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,720
the code from github and try those out

675
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,679
so there are three three exercises you

676
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,200
can choose and pick

677
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,440
to run and then

678
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,720
if you just look at the tutorial how to

679
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,360
set up

680
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,840
the deutsche hosa algorithm is actually

681
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,120
very straightforward

682
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,159
all it is asking you to do is to

683
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,519
use code to set up this circuit

684
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,240
and the usefulness of the code is that

685
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,480
as you grow your qubit

686
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,440
number of qubits you wouldn't want to

687
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,080
draw

688
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,760
all of your qubits out but you can just

689
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,120
use the q-sharp language use code to

690
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,559
directly write out

691
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,679
you have n-cubits and you can apply

692
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,000
h and x gates and you can apply

693
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,640
oracle this is exactly step by step

694
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,080
trying to set up this q v

695
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,120
here so you should go back and try to

696
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,799
run this catas that's it

697
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,679
um to finish off i'm announcing another

698
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,760
certificate this wednesday

699
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,240
the questions are as follows this is

700
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,320
this is less technical

701
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,559
quiz uh it's more of like a historic fun

702
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,559
entertainment so here i wonder who came

703
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,279
up with

704
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,760
the term quantum oracle because it

705
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,320
really

706
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,519
kind of created this

707
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,240
barrier for me to learn what this term

708
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,679
is about

709
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,240
that's not in my culture that's not in

710
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,919
my vocab vocabulary before so

711
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,440
if you are curious like me please

712
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,000
search around and see who came up with

713
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,519
the term

714
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,279
and then i have embedded some

715
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,279
characters in the comics so

716
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,640
on page six who is this person and on

717
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,000
page 26

718
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,159
who is this so you can you can

719
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,440
pick any of this and then tag me on

720
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,039
social media

721
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,279
as i mentioned earlier and you will get

722
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,760
another certificate which i would

723
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,320
announce on wednesday

724
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,760
okay so that's it

725
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,760
time for questions

726
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,840
you
