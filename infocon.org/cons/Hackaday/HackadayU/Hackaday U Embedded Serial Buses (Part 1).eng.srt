hi there my name is alexander rousell

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,000
i'm a canadian hacker specializing in

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,599
embedded systems prototyping and

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,799
development

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,480
i partnered with hackaday to bring you a

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,119
hackaday u course about serial buses

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,480
in this course we're going to be looking

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,800
at two of the more popular serial buses

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,640
used in embedded development which are

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,439
i squared c and one wire they're used to

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,039
communicate with memories and

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,679
sensors and peripherals of all kinds

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,960
we're going to be looking at both of

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,160
these protocols from the

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,960
software hardware and protocol levels

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,000
and we're going to be actually

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,920
looking at practical implementations of

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,200
these protocols

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
so we can actually gather some data

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,120
process it and then do something with it

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,039
like send it to the cloud or display it

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:47,360
to an

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
end user i'm really excited to be

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,960
presenting this course and i hope that

26
