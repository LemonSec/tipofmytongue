00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,160
welcome to this first class of this

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,160
exciting four session course on working

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,080
with leds using arduino

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,759
in this class we'll be using the onboard

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,199
leds of the circuit playground

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,160
microcontroller

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,400
to make our first led animations you'll

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,240
also learn about different led products

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,240
a bit about current power and all about

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,599
how leds work

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,359
you also get your first taste of working

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,920
with fast led a powerful library that

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,000
will help us program our leds

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,200
i'm maribel jones and i'll be

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,719
co-teaching this class with kathy

laughlin who you can meet during our

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,840
optional office hours

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,800
let's get started you'll get the most

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,760
out of this course

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,399

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,039
underscore leds and there you can access

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,480
the course files

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,640
that'll include this slideshow and also

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
a link to the github

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,000
which has all of the source code you'll

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,199
need to follow along

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,559
with this class feel free to head over

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,038
there now

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,040
we're going to be using the circuit

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,280
playground microcontroller in this class

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,400
but what is a microcontroller

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,159
a microcontroller is an electronic

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,240
device which is capable of doing one or

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,280
more tests

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,360
it is made for embedded systems and is

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,000
often used in automatic control systems

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,479
it consists of memory i o ports and a

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,520
processor

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600
a microcontroller unit usually comes

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,520
with a breakout board which might extend

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,479
its capabilities

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,560
here are some popular microcontroller

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,640
units there's the teensy

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,159
the esp32 a pro micro and on the left we

47
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,079
have the arduino uno which is often just

48
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,119
called an arduino

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,960
we're going to be using the circuit

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,640
playground express which is a newer

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,759
microcontroller

52
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,439
loaded up with goodies for us to play

53
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,679
with

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,159
the circuit playground express has 10

55
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,240
neopixels already on board

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,880
it has a temperature sensor it has a

57
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,759
light sensor

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,399
it has a speaker a microphone a slide

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,240
switch two buttons

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,399
and it also has capacitive touch pads

61
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,840
which we'll be using today

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,200
let's get set up first you'll want to

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,360
install the arduino ide

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,560
to do so you can go to arduino.cc and

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
under software you'll see a download

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,120
link

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,480
you'll want to download the correct

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,160
version whether you're on mac or pc

69
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,080
once you're at the arduino home page

70
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
you'll want to go to software

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,840
and then go down to downloads

72
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,200
you'll also see that there's an arduino

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,400
web editor

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,080
but we're going to download the arduino

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,680
ide

76
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,519
if you scroll down you'll see that the

77
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,680
latest version of arduino is 1.8.13

78
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,120
to the right you'll see different

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,920
installers select the installer for your

80
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,200
operating system

81
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,319
i'm going to select mac

82
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,040
arduino is open source software you can

83
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,280
contribute to its development here

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,840
or you can just click just download

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,720
you'll be prompted to save the file

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,359
click ok

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,000
once the file is finished downloading

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
you want to open it up

89
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,079
it should automatically expand

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,000
if you're on windows you're going to

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,519
also want to install the circuit

92
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,879
playground driver

93
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,200
you can find it at the following url

94
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,239
just follow through

95
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,159
with what it says to do and you'll be

96
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,840
all right

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,799
this requires a special driver you're

98
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,560
going to want to go to the adafruit

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
website to find this

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,360
you can also just google windows driver

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,440
adafruit circuit playground express

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,040
and it should be the first option that

103
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
comes up

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,480
once you're on the page that says

105
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
windows driver installation

106
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
you'll see a big green button that says

107
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,840
download latest adafruit windows driver

108
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,159
installer

109
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,239
click this in order to download and run

110
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,560
the installer

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:15,840
then follow the instructions

112
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,720
now we're going to want to install the

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,759
library in arduino we're going to go to

114
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,800
tools

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,479
manage libraries in library manager

116
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,800
type circuit playground express into the

117
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,759
search bar

118
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,320
then click install on adafruit circuit

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440
playground express

120
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,840
now we want to install the library

121
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,639
you're going to want to go up to tools

122
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,840
manage libraries

123
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,919
and then you'll have the library manager

124
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,400
pop-up

125
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,560
we can type in circuit playground

126
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,759
and the adafruit circuit playground

127
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,680
library will pop up

128
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,440
unlike the boards there's just one

129
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,440
library so you only need to worry about

130
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,000
installing

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,160
the adafruit circuit playground library

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
for both the adafruit

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,520
circuit playground board and also the

134
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,120
adafruit circuit playground express

135
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,000
to install it select the version that's

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,120
most recent

137
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,240
then click install

138
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,479
now we're going to install the board in

139
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,919
arduino you're going to want to go back

140
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,199
to tools

141
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,919
and then under boards manager which is

142
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,320
under

143
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,199
board you're going to type in circuit

144
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,479
playground express

145
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,840
into the search bar you can also type in

146
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,880
samd boards if you don't see it

147
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,960
be careful because there's actually two

148
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,080
versions of the circuit

149
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
playground there's a circuit playground

150
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,160
and a circuit playground express

151
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,680
and we want to install the circuit

152
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,759
playground express which is under

153
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,039
samd boards once that comes up click

154
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,880
install to install the latest version

155
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,400
to make sure that you have the right

156
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,680
board installed you want to go to tools

157
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,400
board boards manager

158
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,240
here you should type in samd boards

159
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,759
you'll see that under samd boards the

160
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,160
last

161
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
option is adafruit circuit playground

162
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,919
express

163
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,240
beware that if you just type in circuit

164
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,720
playground

165
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,400
you'll get two different things pop up

166
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
one of these is samd boards for the

167
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,440
adafruit circuit playground express

168
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,680
the other one is for adafruit circuit

169
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,039
playground

170
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,360
we're going to want to select express

171
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,960
because that's the controller that we

172
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,160
have

173
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,400
if you select the most recent version

174
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
and then click install

175
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,800
it will begin the install process

176
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,639
now you want to plug in your circuit

177
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,639
playground in arduino

178
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,880
go to tools board and then select the

179
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,919
circuit playground

180
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,240
express from the list if you don't see

181
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,280
this as an option

182
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,240
you have to install this amd boards go

183
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,080
back a few slides and then try again

184
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,960
to select the right board we go down to

185
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,240
tools

186
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,960
board and then we want to make sure that

187
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
under arduino samd

188
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,120
boards we have adafruit circuit

189
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,479
playground express

190
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,039
selected make sure that if you have an

191
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,039
adafruit circuit playground

192
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,880
that you don't select that for the

193
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
express

194
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,840
in order to make sure that we have the

195
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
right port selected

196
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,199
we want to go to tools port

197
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,039
and then depending on whether or not you

198
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,319
have windows or mac

199
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,879
it might look a little different for me

200
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,240
i have

201
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,360
forward slash dev forward slash cu dot

202
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,479
usb modem

203
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,800
and then a number i also have in

204
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,599
parentheses

205
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,319
adafruit circuit playground express if

206
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,440
you have an older mac

207
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
you might not see adafruit circuit

208
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,958
express pop up

209
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,640
but as long as you have something that

210
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,760
says dev or usb modem

211
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,120
it's probably the right port to create a

212
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,279
new sketch we go to file

213
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,320
new every sketch will be labeled with

214
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,880
sketch

215
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,800
underscore and then the date by default

216
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,920
but you can change this later

217
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,560
you should see a blank arduino sketch

218
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,480
the two main functions in any sketch are

219
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,080
filled in for you

220
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,839
setup which runs when the arduino first

221
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,839
boots and loop which runs constantly in

222
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,600
a loop after setup finishes

223
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,120
and for as long as the arduino is

224
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,720
powered on

225
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,399
if you're a beginner with arduino see

226
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,920
here for more on functions and what they

227
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,079
do

228
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,800
an led is a light emitting diode

229
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,480
when current passes through the led

230
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,000
it causes the led to light up

231
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,839
in addition to finding some of the code

232
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,440
that we'll be using in this course in

233
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
the adafruit library

234
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
you can also find it on github at

235
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,800

239
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,480
once you're there if you click on the

240
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,320
green button that says code you'll be

241
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,839
able to download all of it as a zip

242
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,760
before plugging in place your circuit

243
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,360
playground on top of the bag it came

244
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
with or another anti-static

245
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,600
non-metallic surface never let the back

246
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
of the circuit playground touch metal

247
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,320
when it's plugged in

248
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,640
otherwise you could short it out next

249
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
plug in your circuit playground via

250
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,120
micro usb

251
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
cable you should see it light up with

252
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
its initializing pattern

253
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,040
to get to our example sketches we want

254
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,480
to go to file

255
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,560
examples and then down to adafruit

256
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,640
circuit playground

257
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
here you'll see a whole bunch of

258
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,360
sketches that you can use

259
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,440
you can really dig into these to learn

260
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,920
how to use the microphone

261
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,959
the light sensor and more but for

262
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:29,680
starters

263
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,720
let's just blink this led to get to the

264
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
blink sketch we want to go to

265
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,440
hello circuit playground underneath

266
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,200
hello circuit playground there are some

267
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,880
introductory sketches that should get

268
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
you started using some of the onboard

269
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,519
sensors

270
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,079
of the circuit playground let's start

271
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,560
with blink

272
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,240
in this sketch we see that we're

273
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,760
including the adafruit circuit

274
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,959
playground library

275
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,160
this is the first line of our sketch

276
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,839
then we have a setup function and a loop

277
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,079
function

278
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,839
these are the two main functions in

279
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,760
arduino

280
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,000
in our setup we're initializing the

281
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,440
circuit playground

282
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,240
circuit playground.begin we'll need to

283
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
do this every time we want to use

284
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,760
any function that's in the circuit

285
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,320
playground library

286
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,880
then in our loop we're saying

287
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,279
circuitplayground.redled

288
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,240
high then we have a delay of 500

289
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,120
milliseconds

290
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,839
or half of a second then we're saying

291
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,920
circuit playground.red led

292
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,399
low and then have another delay for half

293
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,160
a second

294
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
what this sketch is doing is it's

295
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,600
targeting the red led

296
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,000
which is d13 on the circuit playground

297
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,040
express

298
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,279
this is an indicator led that's a single

299
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,399
color led

300
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,839
just like the one that i showed in the

301
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,399
video this led will light up when

302
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,680
current passes through

303
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,240
again just like i showed in the video so

304
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,000
what we're doing is we're saying

305
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,360
hi which is sending the maximum voltage

306
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,079
that we can

307
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,279
to this led 255

308
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,000
then we're setting it to low meaning

309
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
that we're setting it to zero

310
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,560
the lowest amount that we can send it

311
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,480
and we have a delay in between

312
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
so when we upload this we should see the

313
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,839
led blink

314
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,320
let's give it a try to upload a sketch

315
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,720
you want to go to the arrow at the top

316
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,519
if you hover over this it'll say upload

317
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,120
you also want to make sure that you have

318
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,040
the correct board

319
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,240
and port selected

320
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,720
once you know that this is the case

321
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,480
click the arrow to upload your sketch

322
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
you'll see the leds on the circuit

323
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,240
playground go from red

324
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,040
then to green when they've gone to green

325
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,160
you know that it's been

326
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,959
uploaded correctly when you upload a new

327
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,760
sketch

328
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,600
the leds on the circuit playground

329
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,079
express will first go from red

330
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,920
then to green and then your sketch will

331
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,079
run

332
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,639
now we can see the red indicator led d13

333
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,120
blinking

334
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,880
if you encounter any problems uploading

335
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,480
your sketch you can press the reset

336
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
button twice

337
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,760
and reset your controller for your first

338
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
challenge try going back to the sketch

339
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,600
and trying to get the led to blink at a

340
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,639
different rate

341
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,639
as a hint try using a different delay

342
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,240
value

343
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,839
what is a neopixel each rgb led

344
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,160
or neopixel is actually made up of three

345
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
smaller leds

346
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,240
one red one green and one blue the

347
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,920
combination of these three color

348
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,480
channels

349
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,120
creates the visible color of the led

350
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
when all three colors are turned on

351
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
you'll see white

352
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,079
and when none of them are that's black

353
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,720
so black is always equivalent to off

354
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,560
other colors are created by mixing the

355
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,480
three color values

356
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,000
you can try this out for yourself by

357
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
using the hello neopixel sketch

358
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,680
try changing the last three numbers in

359
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,079
the parentheses to mix the red green

360
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,399
and blue color values let's give this a

361
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,720
try

362
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,000
we see our leds light up with various

363
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
rainbow colors

364
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,560
and then they go black

365
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,320
this happens at a half second cycle

366
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,560
it's nice having source code to use but

367
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,440
we learn best by trying things ourselves

368
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,360
let's try changing the values in

369
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,600
circuitplayground.setpixelcolor

370
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,240
to make our own colors can you try

371
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,320
changing the pixel number and also the

372
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
rgb values

373
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,240
in the first challenge just try making

374
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,880
your own colors have fun and experiment

375
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
for the second challenge try turning all

376
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,560
of them to purple

377
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
for the third challenge try turning them

378
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,600
all to white

379
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
and then all off and then all white

380
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,440
again

381
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,160
for advanced users try using a for loop

382
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
to set the color of all the leds

383
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,839
at the same time or try making your own

384
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
animations

385
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,120
this principle of finding an example or

386
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,240
demo sketch

387
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,839
and then experimenting with the

388
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,480
functions and also the variable values

389
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,320
in order to see what they do will serve

390
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,360
you well when learning arduino

391
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,560
programmable rgb leds use an onboard

392
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,440
driver chip

393
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,199
to turn the electrical signals on your

394
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,759
data wire into programmable colors

395
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,440
by setting the red green and blue

396
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,959
channels accordingly

397
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,360
the library we'll be using fast led can

398
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,000
handle most

399
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,480
programmable led drivers the most

400
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,880
commonly used are ws2811

401
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,800
2812 and 2813 adafruit's neopixel line

402
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,079
are some of our favorites

403
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,920
due to the wide variety of products they

404
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,000
offer but you can also find

405
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,440
more affordable products online

406
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,800
individual leds you can get surface

407
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,360
mount through-hole and even sewable leds

408
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,639
online

409
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,320
these can be great for embedding subtle

410
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,079
lights into projects or wearables

411
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,680
without ending up with an overt

412
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,638
light strip look

413
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,320
led strip the led workhorse

414
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,639
strip comes in densities from 30 leds

415
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
per meter to 144

416
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,480
higher density strips require more power

417
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,959
note the led strip is easily damaged if

418
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,440
you don't take care when installing it

419
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,759
it's best to not bend or crease led

420
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,560
strip

421
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,480
so if you take it around a corner it's

422
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,320
best to cut the strip and solder some

423
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,440
jumper wires between the two strips

424
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,720
led modules these are individual rgb

425
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,519
leds

426
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,680
each sealed into its own waterproof

427
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,839
module with a diffuser

428
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,399
short wires typically four inches

429
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,800
separate each module from the next

430
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,759
great for a light bright look or for

431
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,759
embedding individual pixels into the

432
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,519
surface of complex outdoor artworks

433
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,640
led matrixes these come in square or

434
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,480
rectangular formats

435
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,599
larger matrixes require more power

436
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,599
the leds in your matrix can either be

437
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,599
wired across like a typewriter

438
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,640
or back and forth like a snake fast led

439
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,599
can address both

440
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,199
as long as you tell it which type you

441
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,439
have if your matrix doesn't say

442
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,520
then don't worry experimenting is an

443
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,400
easy way to find out

444
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,039
led rings these come in sizes from about

445
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,360
12 leds up to 60.

446
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
the larger rings require two power

447
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,160
injections we'll talk about those later

448
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,240
the smalls can be powered off in arduino

449
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,440
as is

450
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,039
these look cool as they are but they're

451
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,679
also fun to embed inside round objects

452
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,919
they can make cool eyes if you install

453
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,520
them in pairs and are careful with the

454
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,600
programming

455
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,640
side emitting led strip these are

456
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,559
powerful when you want to use led strips

457
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,240
but you need to attach the lights to the

458
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,600
inside of a solid shape

459
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,320
such as a tube or half dome or need them

460
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,960
to shine

461
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,080
out rather than up unlike regular flat

462
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,760
strips these strips can bend to an

463
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,559
extent without damage

464
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,919
led neon these leds are embedded inside

465
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,240
a thick neon look diffuser

466
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
they're quite flexible making them

467
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,080
perfect for lining complex surfaces

468
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,400
using as recessed lighting in a room or

469
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,320
making neon art

470
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,559
now it's time to make our own animations

471
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,720
using the fast led library

472
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
fast led is a powerful library that

473
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,480
allows us to make many patterns and

474
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,640
animations pretty easily

475
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,960
before we can use fast led we need to

476
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,640
install the library

477
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,600
to do so we'll go to manage libraries

478
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,039
and add fast led we can find it using

479
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,480
the search bar

480
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,320
just click the latest version and click

481
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,559
install

482
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,480
once it's installed you'll find all the

483
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320
example sketches under file

484
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,760
examples fast led if you've used fast

485
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,200
led before

486
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
you can feel free to try the other

487
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,200
example sketches

488
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,679
we can use any fast led sketch with the

489
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,320
onboard leds of the circuit playground

490
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,360
by changing the data pin to eight

491
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,200
all of the onboard circuit playground

492
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,480
leds are wired to pin 8.

493
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,240
we'll also need to change the number of

494
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,760
leds to 10

495
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
and if there's a clock line mentioned

496
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,160
we'll need to comment that out

497
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,400
to install the fastlady library go to

498
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
manage libraries

499
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,720
then type fast led

500
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,000
there might be several options that pop

501
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,520
up but you want to choose the one that

502
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,360
just says fast led

503
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,120
select the most current version and

504
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,760
click install

505
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,200
once it's installed open up fast led's

506
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,160
blink sketch

507
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,720
this can be found under examples fast

508
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,320
led

509
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,879
and blink

510
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,640
you'll notice that this sketch looks

511
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,240
very different from our other blink

512
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,200
sketch

513
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,280
this is because fast led programs

514
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,480
lighting a little differently

515
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,799
first what we'll want to do is comment

516
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,559
out clock pin

517
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,919
we can do this with two forward slashes

518
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,080
then we want to change the define for

519
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,000
data pin to eight

520
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,559
eight is the pin that all of our leds on

521
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,000
board the circuit playground

522
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,880
are connected to then we want to change

523
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,000
the number of leds

524
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,240
to 10. there are 10 on-board leds

525
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,000
double check your values then hit upload

526
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,360
hmm only one led is blinking we changed

527
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,600
num leds to 10 so why don't all of them

528
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,799
work

529
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,480
here's why leds within fast led

530
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,960
are treated as elements in an array you

531
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,200
can see the array declaration

532
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,480
on or around line 14. if you don't have

533
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,080
line numbers turned on

534
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,439
you can go to preferences

535
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,280
and then check displaying line numbers

536
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,640
so on line 13 we see crgb

537
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,400
leds num leds as an array

538
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,320
this tells fast led we would like to

539
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,159
reserve space for an array

540
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,000
of 10 crgb objects aka

541
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,120
rgb pixels note that this line

542
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
always goes at the top outside of the

543
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,000
setup and loop functions

544
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
below you'll see the following line in

545
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,200
setup

546
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,280
fast led add leds neopixel data pin

547
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,840
and then in parentheses leds comma num

548
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
leds

549
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,320
this tells fastlady that you have

550
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,720
neopixels on data pin

551
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,799
they are to be stored in the leds array

552
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,520
and there are num leds of them

553
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,480
you always need a fast led add leds call

554
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,120
and setup when working with fast led

555
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,880
there are many options for this line

556
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,640
since there are many kinds of leds in

557
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,520
the world

558
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,200
check out the other entries for some

559
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,520
possibilities

560
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,159
anyway scroll down to the loop function

561
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,760
and we'll see why our leds aren't

562
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,640
lighting up

563
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,400
in loop our code says the following leds

564
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,000
0 equals crgb red

565
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,960
then there's a call to fast led show

566
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,679
which is a function of fast led

567
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,559
then we have a delay of half a second

568
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,360
what this says

569
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,799
is light leds number zero to red

570
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,520
then call fast ledshow then wait half a

571
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,679
second before continuing

572
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,440
then the code does the exact thing to

573
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,000
set the led at zero back to black

574
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
completing our blank cycle these three

575
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,400
lines represent the fundamentals of any

576
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,080
fast led sketch

577
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
code that changes the values in the leds

578
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,039
array a fast led.show call

579
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,600
and some timing code at its ordinary

580
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,840
speed the arduino operates much too fast

581
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,200
for humans to perceive

582
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,799
so we need a way to change our lights

583
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,240
more slowly

584
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
note that delay is not the way you

585
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,159
should do this in non-demo code

586
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,840
we'll explain a better way in the next

587
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,799
class the only confusing thing here

588
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,919
is fastly d.show use this call whenever

589
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,919
you want the strip to update

590
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,840
it'll cause fast led to write the

591
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
contents of the led array

592
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,320
out to the actual lights often you'll

593
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,960
use just

594
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,200
one fast led show call at the end of

595
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,480
your animation loop

596
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,080
after you've made all the color changes

597
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,000
you want to make this is important

598
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,720
because fastled.show can be an expensive

599
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
call in terms of time

600
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
if you can call it just once per timing

601
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
cycle you'll improve the efficiency of

602
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,760
your code

603
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,240
in the case of this demo however we have

604
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,480
two show calls inside the loop

605
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,559
one for the red color change and one for

606
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,840
the black

607
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,279
and this also happens to answer our

608
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,960
question from earlier

609
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
only one led is blinking because we're

610
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
only changing leds

611
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,240
zero which is the first led in our array

612
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,799
note that arrays always count from zero

613
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,600
and stop at

614
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,720
one minus num leds in this case zero

615
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,760
through nine

616
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,080
it might seem intuitive to copy and

617
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,600
paste

618
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,840
in order to get all of the leds to show

619
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,760
but this takes a long time

620
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,480
maybe there's a better way to do this

621
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,000
when you have this many pixels

622
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,760
it's not really practical to copy and

623
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,080
paste thus we're going to use a control

624
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,000
structure called a for loop to do the

625
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,120
work for us

626
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,440
change your code to look like so first

627
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,400
we're going to write

628
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,080
4 opening parentheses

629
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,120
int which stands for integer and number

630
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,600
i which is a variable and we're going to

631
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,480
start at zero

632
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,400
while i is less than

633
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,840
num leds which we already set earlier to

634
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,080
10

635
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,720
then we want to increase it i plus plus

636
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,360
now what we want to do is instead of

637
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,559
changing

638
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,600
0 to red

639
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,799
we want to change any led that is i

640
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,360
to red then we're still going to do fast

641
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,640
led show

642
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,600
and then a delay now we want to do the

643
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,799
same thing

644
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,400
for turning the leds off you can type

645
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,840
this out again or you can copy and paste

646
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,159
again we're going to have this for loop

647
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,760
and then instead of changing it to red

648
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
we want to turn them off which remember

649
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,000
is

650
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,200
black let's give this a try

651
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,279
now let's try an experiment what if in

652
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,360
our for loop instead of having i

653
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,960
as less than num leds we had i

654
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,120
less than num leds divided by 2.

655
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,799
let's try this for both of our for loops

656
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,120
what do you think will happen can you

657
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,720
guess

658
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,559
we'll see the first half of our leds

659
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,960
light up

660
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,640
let's make another change to our sketch

661
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,480
what if instead of dividing the number

662
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,159
of leds by two

663
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,440
for our up to in our array what if we

664
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,000
changed

665
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,960
int i to equal the number of leds

666
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,320
divided by two

667
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,400
let's try doing this in both of our for

668
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,799
loops

669
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,039
can you guess what will happen now we

670
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,799
see the other half of our leds light up

671
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,400
by this point you may have worked out

672
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,840
how four loops work

673
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,440
you give them a starting point and

674
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,760
ending point and instructions to execute

675
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,039
at each step of the loop

676
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,279
in most cases i plus plus which is a

677
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,039
shorthand way of writing the most common

678
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:55,919
iterator

679
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,600
i equals i plus 1. aka do this for every

680
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,520
entry in the array

681
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,000
let's go back to our basic for loop what

682
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,200
if instead of having

683
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,720
i plus plus since this means i equals i

684
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,159
plus 1

685
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,080
we had i equals i plus 2.

686
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
let's try making this change for both of

687
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,159
our for loops

688
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,840
can you guess what will happen

689
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,960
now we see every other pixel blink i bet

690
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,880
you get the picture

691
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
you'll use for loops later on to develop

692
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,720
more complex lighting patterns

693
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,480
to read more about for loops see the

694
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,120
reference here

695
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,640
one important thing to remember when

696
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,399
experimenting with for loops is that

697
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,159
trying to write to an array element

698
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,240
which is beyond the end of your array

699
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,520
as defined in num leds may cause crashes

700
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,559
freezes and other undesirable effects

701
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,480
likewise reading beyond the end of an

702
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,360
array will return unexpected values

703
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,559
because you're actually reading them

704
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,320
from whatever happens to be stored right

705
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,840
after your array

706
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,480
these off by one errors are an extremely

707
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,880
common cause of bugs even for seasoned

708
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,080
programmers

709
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,000
so always check your code to ensure that

710
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,320
you don't access any pixels beyond the

711
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,360
end of your num

712
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,640
leds array when you're finished save the

713
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,200
file

714
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,679
we'll call it basic led playground you

715
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,559
can use it as an example later on

716
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,159
lastly we're going to upload a very

717
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,159
pretty demo for you to study or stare at

718
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,840
before the next class

719
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,559
go to file examples fast led color

720
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,159
palette

721
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,279
as above change data pin to 8 and num

722
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,799
leds to 10.

723
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,960
hit upload and witness the firepower of

724
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,399
your fully operational circuit

725
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,080
playground express

726
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,679
for the next class have a look through

727
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,120
this sketch and see if you can figure

728
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,559
out what's going on

729
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,159
in the meantime let's talk more about

730
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,080
leds on and off the circuit playground

731
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,360
our ws series leds have three wires or

732
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,799
solder pads

733
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,399
5-volt power ground and data

734
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,559
the wires are usually red black and

735
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,679
green or blue

736
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,880
respectively to control them you'll need

737
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,080
to connect the data

738
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,960
to a digital pin on the arduino the

739
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,799
power to an external 5 volt

740
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,520
dc power supply and the ground to both

741
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,080
the ground

742
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,279
on the arduino and on the power supply

743
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,520
the circuit playground has 10 leds which

744
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,120
are already installed for you

745
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,799
and these use pin d8 as their data pin

746
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,600
to use an external led strip matrix or

747
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,720
other device

748
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,960
we'll need to connect the data line from

749
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,559
our stripper matrix

750
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,200
to a data pin on the circuit playground

751
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,440
to drive more leds than our onboard the

752
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,799
circuit playground you'll need to

753
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,720
connect them to an external power supply

754
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,559
like one of the ones shown here

755
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,559
this is because arduinos can only power

756
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,200
a handful of pixels from their 3.3 volts

757
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,440
or

758
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,159
5 volt pins once you have more than 10

759
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,080
pixels attached to an arduino

760
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,480
without any external power odds are that

761
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,080
you will underpower your arduino

762
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,720
causing light glitches or freezes if

763
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
your arduino freezes at any point during

764
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,159
lighting programming

765
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,000
power down the arduino and your lighting

766
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,080
power supply disconnect the lights from

767
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,000
the arduino and then power the arduino

768
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,960
up again

769
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,320
if you don't see freezing with the

770
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,159
lights disconnected this is an

771
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,000
indication that you need to add external

772
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,200
power to your leds before you continue

773
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,360
also when rgb leds are not getting

774
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,240
enough power

775
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,799
they tend to color shift if this happens

776
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,320
you'll see the colors on the end of your

777
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,279
strip

778
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,840
shift towards red since the red led on

779
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,360
the chip is the one that requires the

780
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,480
least amount of power

781
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,360
the others brown out first if you start

782
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,360
to see power drop or color shift along

783
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,320
your strip

784
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,000
you should add additional power to the

785
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,720
end of the strip

786
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,240
it is acceptable to power a small amount

787
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,279
of leds

788
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,080
off of the circuit playground itself to

789
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,720
do so

790
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,120
you need your led strip and you need

791
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,159
three alligator clips

792
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,679
you'll want to attach both of the

793
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,360
grounds if there's two

794
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,519
there might just be one to the black

795
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,960
alligator clip

796
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,200
and then attach power to the red

797
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,000
alligator clip

798
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
finally attach your data line which

799
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,120
could be white green

800
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,760
blue yellow or another color to the

801
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,399
green alligator clip

802
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,399
if you're following along with a matrix

803
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,880
a pixel ring or something else

804
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,360
you can set it up the same way you just

805
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,960
want your red alligator clip

806
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,240
to go to 5 volts you want your black

807
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,399
alligator clip to go to ground

808
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,519
or gnd and then you want your green

809
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,720
alligator clip

810
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,480
to go to data in which is usually din

811
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,320
attach the other end of the green

812
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,559
alligator clip to a7

813
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,760
on your microcontroller

814
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,200
attach the black alligator clip to

815
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,240
ground

816
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,760
there are two grounds on the circuit

817
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,519
playground and either one is fine

818
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,360
then attach the red alligator clip to v

819
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,000
out which

820
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,360
stands for voltage out

821
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
make sure again that your power and

822
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,080
ground are not touching and that your

823
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,840
data is not touching

824
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,440
now it's time to upload our code to test

825
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,760
our strip we can use any of the fast led

826
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,880
example sketches to find these we're

827
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,480
going to want to go into arduino

828
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,559
go up to file examples

829
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,600
and then down to fast led

830
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,719
let's choose cylon

831
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,720
in this sketch we see we're including

832
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,880
the fast led library

833
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,840
then we're defining the number of leds

834
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,159
let's change this to 10.

835
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,559
we don't want to power too many leds off

836
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,600
of the circuit playground

837
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,159
microcontroller

838
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,159
if we power too many leds off of our

839
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,840
microcontroller we can hurt our

840
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,880
equipment

841
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,600
so let's limit it to 10. this number

842
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,679
should also include any leds that are on

843
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,360
board the circuit playground

844
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,799
so if you are already powering the

845
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,600
onboard leds of the circuit playground

846
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,679
it's a good idea not to power additional

847
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,600
leds off the board

848
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,200
in this case i'm only going to be

849
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,120
powering an external strip

850
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,159
so it's okay and then down here i see

851
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,120
that it's asking me for a data pin

852
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,399
i've connected my data to a7

853
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,159
the circuit playground has multiple

854
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,240
input output pins

855
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,159
to know which ones these are however

856
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,240
it's useful to look at a pin out map

857
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,200
you can find the pin out map for

858
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,799
adafruit circuit playground

859
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,840
by typing in pin out circuit playground

860
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,320
express

861
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,760
the first result you get should be pin

862
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,320
outs adafruit circuit playground express

863
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,519
and it's on the adafruit website

864
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,679
here you'll find information about all

865
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,360
of the pins on the adafruit circuit

866
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,600
playground express

867
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,919
there's a big map that'll show you both

868
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:08,960
the digital pins

869
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,918
and the analog pins the digital pins are

870
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:12,639
in purple

871
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,918
and the analog pins are in green you can

872
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,560
also see an overview of the i o

873
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,839
at the top of this map

874
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,918
if the map is too confusing you can also

875
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:26,639
scroll down

876
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,679
on the same pin outs page and you can

877
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,079
find

878
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,719
information about important connections

879
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,280
on the circuit playground

880
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,199
for example it will tell you about input

881
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,520
output pads

882
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,599
it will also tell you what each pin is

883
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,960
so if i go down through this list i see

884
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,079
that a7

885
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,040
is also d1 and that this pin can be

886
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,719
digital input output

887
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,239
or analog input this pin also has

888
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,440
pulse width modulation output

889
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,079
it also has serial transmit and it can

890
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,680
be used as a capacitive touch sensor

891
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,240
each pin has different capabilities so

892
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,760
it's good to have a look at this if

893
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
you're wondering where to attach

894
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,560
your components

895
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,520
it also has a list of internally used

896
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,640
pins

897
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,560
these are pins that are reserved for the

898
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,400
on-board circuitry

899
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
so things like the built-in light sensor

900
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,320
and temperature sensor

901
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,839
we're not going to be covering those in

902
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,079
this class but i do have another class

903
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,599
that's in sensors in case you're

904
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,839
interested you can sign up at hackaday u

905
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,640
now that we know which pin a7 is we can

906
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,599
change it in our code

907
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,320
so let's change it to 1 which is the

908
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,800
same as

909
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,640
a7 we now see a define

910
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,520
statement for a clock pin this is

911
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,079
because

912
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,040
some led strips use a clock line this is

913
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,160
in order to keep specific timing

914
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,240
we don't have this so we can comment it

915
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,200
out

916
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,160
by including two forward slashes this

917
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,520
will gray out the text

918
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,119
and that means it'll be treated like a

919
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,599
comment this is useful if you want to

920
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,880
write notes to yourself

921
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,640
or others about what's going on in your

922
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,200
code the rest of the sketch

923
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,400
looks a little familiar to us let's

924
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,000
upload it and see if we can figure out

925
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,760
what's going on

926
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,240
we see a rainbow pattern on just 10 of

927
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,640
our leds

928
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,800
the rainbow pattern only affects 10 even

929
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,040
though there's more than 10 leds

930
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,040
because we set the number of leds to 10.

931
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,119
programming short strips like this can

932
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,240
be useful when you're prototyping but to

933
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,160
power more leds we'll need a power

934
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,839
supply

935
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,680
an electrical circuit is the path

936
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,200
through which an electrical current

937
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,640
travels

938
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,119
in this diagram we see a battery and a

939
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,480
light bulb

940
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,640
these two when connected with wires

941
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,720
create a simple circuit

942
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,240
we might add a button in the middle of

943
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,160
the circuit this would allow us to

944
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,599
interrupt the circuit

945
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,200
turning the light bulb on and off

946
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,079
because we're opening the circuit

947
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,720
here's another example using a switch in

948
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,480
the same way we can break the flow of

949
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,240
current to turn the light bulb on and

950
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,000
off

951
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,240
dc or direct current is defined by the

952
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,680
flow of an electric charge in one

953
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,880
direction

954
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,960
in dc current the electrons move in one

955
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,800
direction from an area of negative

956
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,200
charge

957
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,839
to an area of positive charge this is

958
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,200
unlike alternating current

959
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,560
where current can flow in both

960
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,440
directions dc current is the kind we'll

961
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,040
be using to power our lights

962
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,920
and it uses two wires power always the

963
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,640
red wire

964
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,599
and ground always the black power is the

965
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,880
hot wire

966
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,160
this means if you touch it while

967
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,240
grounded you'll get a shock albeit a

968
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,000
small one since we're only using five

969
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,280
volts

970
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,880
the ground wire allows the current to

971
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,640
return to the power supply rather than

972
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,000
the earth beneath us

973
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,240
completing the circuit if the ground

974
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
wire isn't attached current won't flow

975
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,440
through the circuit and your lights

976
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,560
won't light

977
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,079
in general always ensure that you

978
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,599
connect the ground wire before you

979
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,000
connect the power wire

980
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,680
three main factors in electrical

981
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,040
circuits are voltage

982
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,640
the difference in electric energy

983
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,119
between two points measured in volts

984
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,920
current the rate of flow of electricity

985
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,119
measured in amps

986
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,000
and resistance how resistant your wire

987
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
is to the flow of electricity measured

988
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,599
in ohms

989
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,680
larger wires have lower resistance than

990
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,720
thinner wires

991
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,040
thus thinner wires lose more energy to

992
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,839
heat than larger wires

993
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,440
using a wire that's too small for the

994
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,200
voltage and amps you're trying to pass

995
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,800
through it is dangerous because it can

996
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,079
start a fire

997
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,200
for 5 volt lighting 16 awg wire is

998
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,359
usually sufficient for your power leads

999
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,440
as long as they're not too long and

1000
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,880
standard 18 or 20

1001
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,680
awg wire is fine for shorter jumper

1002
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,320
wires

1003
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,760
like between two sections of strip

1004
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,839
we can think of electricity like a water

1005
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,440
hose and voltage current

1006
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,000
and resistance in terms of this for

1007
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,920
voltage which is measured in volts we

1008
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,680
might think of it as the pressure of the

1009
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,680
water going through the hose

1010
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,760
for current which is measured in amps

1011
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,040
and abbreviated as a

1012
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,599
or i usually we think of this as the

1013
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,800
size of the hose

1014
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,960
if it's a narrower hose less water can

1015
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,079
get through at a time

1016
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,160
if it's a wider hose more water can get

1017
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,680
through

1018
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,320
resistance we calculate in ohms which is

1019
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,280
usually written as

1020
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,480
r or the symbol for om we might think of

1021
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,240
this as sand in the hose

1022
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,960
this adds resistance to the water so the

1023
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,560
more sand there is in the hose

1024
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,400
the more resistance there is to the flow

1025
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,839
of water

1026
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,839
the basic equation that governs the

1027
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,040
relationship

1028
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,160
between voltage current and resistance

1029
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,680
is the following voltage equals

1030
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,119
current times resistance if you ever

1031
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,079
need to do so

1032
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,839
you can solve for i to figure out which

1033
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,599
resistor you need to add in order to

1034
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,960
keep the current running through your

1035
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,200
leds below the suggested current on the

1036
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,400
data sheet

1037
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,040
in practice using a 300 to 500 ohm

1038
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,640
resistor as above will work for

1039
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,480
neopixels

1040
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,640
neopixels usually draw about 20

1041
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,680
milliamps when each is animated

1042
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,160
in 60 milliamps if they're on white at

1043
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,240
full brightness

1044
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,680
you can use this number to figure out

1045
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,680
how many amps you'll need for your power

1046
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,200
supplies

1047
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,920
many products like our neopixel matrix

1048
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,240
also give a total amperage or amperage

1049
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,839
per meter

1050
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,599
in that case use that to decide your

1051
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,119
power supply

1052
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,960
your voltage should match the voltage

1053
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,319
listed on the lights

1054
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,200
within about 0.5 volts or so you can get

1055
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
away with running neopixels off three

1056
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,680
alkaline aaa batteries for instance

1057
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,040
because they provide 4.5 volts

1058
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,680
do not ever use a power supply that

1059
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,160
lists a higher voltage than your lights

1060
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,680
plus 1 to 5 or so for example

1061
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,839
a 12 volt power supply with 5 volt

1062
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,119
lights

1063
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,280
applying a higher voltage to your strip

1064
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,240
will burn them out

1065
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,040
instantly be very careful to ensure that

1066
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,319
your power supply is

1067
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,280
always set to 5 volts if you are using a

1068
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
variable voltage power supply

1069
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,839
like the bench power supply or 5 volt

1070
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,920
selectable supply

1071
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,560
however it's safe to slightly over amp

1072
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,160
your projects

1073
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,000
since amps represent the potential rate

1074
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,359
of flow it's not absolute magnitude

1075
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,119
choosing a power supply that provides

1076
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,040
about 20 percent more than the max

1077
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,800
amperage you plan to use

1078
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,560
will help decrease heat at the power

1079
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,119
supply and support the longevity of your

1080
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,560
lights

1081
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,240
it's a good idea to do the math to

1082
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,000
ensure that your power supply provides

1083
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,920
enough amps to light your lights at full

1084
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,119
white too

1085
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,640
otherwise you could toast your power

1086
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,319
supply at midnight right before you

1087
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,920
present your project

1088
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,480
ask me how i know reading circuit

1089
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,240
diagrams is beyond the scope of this

1090
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,880
class

1091
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,640
but it's good to know the basic diagram

1092
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,119
for an led is as follows

1093
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,880
this diagram shows the positive and

1094
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,040
negative poles on your power supply

1095
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,680
the two flat lines your resistor the

1096
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,880
wave evs

1097
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,040
and the led shown as a diode which is

1098
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,079
technically the d

1099
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,440
in led the triangle with the flat line

1100
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,160
we talked earlier about brown outs which

1101
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,599
might happen if you aren't giving your

1102
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,599
leds enough power

1103
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,760
to solve this problem we can use power

1104
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,280
injections

1105
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,520
as a rule of thumb it's usually safe to

1106
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,040
add a power injection

1107
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,079
after every 50 5 volt red green blue

1108
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,599
pixels

1109
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,520
this means you can power about a hundred

1110
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,880
rgb pixels

1111
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,800
with a power injection on both sides

1112
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,359
without cutting the strip

1113
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,119
you can use this calculator to help you

1114
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,760
figure out where to add power injections

1115
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,839
enter the values for your leds from the

1116
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,200
datasheet for your product

1117
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,880
best practices include adding a

1118
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,480
capacitor

1119
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,720
across the plus and minus terminals of

1120
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,160
your power supply

1121
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,520
where your power wires are connected

1122
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,599
the capacitor will buffer any changes in

1123
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,920
the current drawn by the strip

1124
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,319
you can also place a 300 to 500 ohm

1125
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,560
resistor at the end of your data line

1126
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,160
right before the first pixel on your

1127
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,960
strip this helps prevent surges that can

1128
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,160
burn out the first pixel

1129
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,119
jacketed 16 2 hookup wire available

1130
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,119
cheap from digikey or mauser

1131
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,720
is perfect for running wires from your

1132
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,800
power supply to your lights

1133
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,640
it's best to keep this run as short as

1134
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,400
possible within reason

1135
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,240
if you can put the power supply within a

1136
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,520
few feet of your lights

1137
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,280
you'll cut down on heat generation and

1138
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,760
voltage drop it's surprisingly easy to

1139
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,240
run 5 volt lights down to nothingness

1140
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,800
just from the length of the power cable

1141
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,040
you can also add jsts or molex

1142
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,640
connectors to the power pads on your

1143
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,119
strip

1144
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,280
and your power cables to make them easy

1145
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,839
to disconnect

1146
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,400
to add power injections to a longer

1147
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,319
strip you'll need to cut the strip

1148
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,480
they usually have cut lines and add

1149
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,079
jumper wires

1150
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,119
use 18 or 20 gauge hookup wire

1151
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,280
jump the data line straight across from

1152
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,839
data out to data in

1153
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,839
and then connect power and ground to

1154
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,160
your external power supply

1155
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,800
you can add jsts or molex connectors to

1156
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,839
make it easy to disconnect your power

1157
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:08,000
injections

1158
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,680
it's fine to add more than one power

1159
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,680
injection to the same power supply

1160
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,440
just make sure you always leave about

1161
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,280
twenty percent headroom on the supply's

1162
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,640
total wattage

1163
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,000
more on this later it is important to

1164
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,839
ensure that the ground wires from all of

1165
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,520
your power supplies as well as the

1166
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,359
ground pin on the arduino itself

1167
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,400
are connected otherwise interference and

1168
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,240
ground loops can cause unpredictable

1169
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,640
color errors which we call data noise

1170
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,280
along your strip just ensure that your

1171
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,280
arduino's ground pin and all the ground

1172
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:37,839
pins

1173
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,440
from the power supplies are tied

1174
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,560
together as you install

1175
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,400
heat control is also a factor in a

1176
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,560
successful led installation

1177
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,880
where possible attaching your leds to

1178
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,280
aluminum channel or another metal

1179
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,520
usually double sided thermal tape will

1180
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,440
extend the lifetime of your leds and

1181
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,560
prevent failures due to heat buildup

1182
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,480
we've covered a lot of information and

1183
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,319
it's easy to be intimidated

1184
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,319
but don't worry start small if you're

1185
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,000
new to using leds

1186
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,680
and then work your way up to the

1187
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,680
thousands and thousands of meters of

1188
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,880
pixels

1189
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,720
it's important to know these concepts in

1190
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,040
order to work up to big installations

1191
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,560
but when you're starting with less than

1192
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,480
10 leds you don't really have to worry

1193
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,079
about moving off the board

1194
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,040
or about external power feel free to

1195
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,480
start wherever you're comfortable

1196
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,160
and work up to the more complicated

1197
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,160
concepts in class 2

1198
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,560
we'll go further with power injections

1199
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,640
and show how to use them

1200
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,119
so don't worry if you didn't follow

1201
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,480
let's learn by doing

1202
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,240
and set up an led strip or a matrix

1203
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,240
the cable you bought for your dc power

1204
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,000
supply has three wires

1205
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,720
hot neutral and ground the wire colors

1206
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,400
correspond to these

1207
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,480
cords from north america and japan often

1208
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,680
have black white

1209
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,359
and green or green and yellow striped

1210
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,839
wires cords from the rest of the world

1211
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,880
often have brown

1212
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,599
blue and green and yellow striped wires

1213
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,440
which is fast becoming common in the us

1214
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,640
as well

1215
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,160
see here for the color code for your

1216
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,240
cable once you're 100

1217
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,400
sure which cable you have remove it from

1218
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,800
the packaging but don't plug it in yet

1219
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,560
strip the ends of all three wires to a

1220
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,839
length of about a half an inch

1221
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,839
then use a screwdriver to loosen the hot

1222
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,680
neutral and ground pads on the power

1223
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,359
supply

1224
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,560
and insert each wire

1225
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,760
make sure not to leave any bare wire

1226
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,079
exposed for safety you want the stripped

1227
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,680
ends of the wires to be all the way

1228
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,359
inside each pad

1229
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,119
screw each pad down so the wire is

1230
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,560
securely fastened

1231
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,800
finally triple check your wire order as

1232
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,400
you can blow up your power supply by

1233
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,079
getting this backwards

1234
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,000
once you're happy with your work i like

1235
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,839
to put a piece of electrical tape across

1236
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,520
the top of the pad so there's no chance

1237
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,119
that you could touch them or drop a tool

1238
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,440
and inadvertently short the connections

1239
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,440
some power supplies already come with a

1240
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,599
piece of protective plastic

1241
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,520
ac line voltage is dangerous so be

1242
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,720
careful

1243
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,640
in the following section we'd like to

1244
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,160
make sure that you have everything

1245
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,960
unplugged and unpowered it's very

1246
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,480
important that you do not have

1247
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,200
power to either your microcontroller or

1248
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,640
your power supply

1249
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,839
when completing the upcoming steps

1250
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,559
in order to attach our leds to our power

1251
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,520
supply

1252
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,119
we're going to need to attach power and

1253
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,760
ground so we'll need one wire for power

1254
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,079
which is red and one wire for ground

1255
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,559
which is either white or black

1256
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,559
strip the ends of your wire to about a

1257
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,599
half an inch or so

1258
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,440
then we're going to want to undo the

1259
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,839
pads that are on the power supply

1260
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,800
we want to undo one for power and one

1261
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,079
for ground

1262
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,880
these are listed as v plus and v

1263
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,440
negative

1264
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,119
on the power supply loosen the pads with

1265
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,079
the screwdriver

1266
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,839
so that you have enough space to insert

1267
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,319
your wire

1268
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,760
then secure your wire by tightening it

1269
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,559
with the screwdriver

1270
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,760
make sure no wire is exposed this is our

1271
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,680
setup from earlier where we are powering

1272
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,800
the strips off of the microcontroller

1273
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,079
we're going to need to make a couple

1274
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,599
changes in order to get this to work

1275
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,720
with our external power supply

1276
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,480
because we're going to be powering it

1277
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,559
off the power supply we can remove

1278
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,559
power from the microcontroller

1279
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,319
and then we'll connect it to power by

1280
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,160
clipping the other end of our alligator

1281
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,960
clip to the red wire

1282
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,119
now we have a clean connection of power

1283
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,640
from the power strip

1284
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,200
to power on our power supply which again

1285
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,240
is plus v

1286
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,040
or v plus

1287
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,520
we already have data connected to the

1288
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,520
data line on our led strip

1289
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,079
that's good we don't need to change that

1290
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,720
but we do need to change ground

1291
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,280
all of the grounds need to be shared so

1292
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,200
what we're going to do

1293
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,480
is that we'll take the end that's

1294
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,319
plugged into both of our grounds on our

1295
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,599
power strip

1296
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,680
and we'll also connect it to our ground

1297
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,839
on our power supply

1298
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,640
you can do this by twisting the wires

1299
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,200
and then

1300
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,079
clipping with the alligator clip this is

1301
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,160
okay for a test setup

1302
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,440
but if you're doing a permanent

1303
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,200
installation you're going to want to use

1304
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,079
a connector

1305
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,280
we'll talk about those later on

1306
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,040
make sure that your power and your

1307
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,880
ground lines aren't touching

1308
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,359
it's very very important that power and

1309
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,599
ground do not touch

1310
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,359
you also want to make sure that data

1311
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,960
isn't touching power or ground

1312
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,559
when everything's set you can plug in

1313
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:13,920
your microcontroller

1314
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,880
and also turn on your power supply and

1315
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,400
then you can upload your code to your

1316
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,280
microcontroller

1317
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,920
you'll see a green light that indicates

1318
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,400
that the power supply is on

1319
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,079
and then when you upload your code

1320
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:40,400
you'll see your leds animate

1321
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,440
so to recap this circuit has a

1322
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,920
connection from ground

1323
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,200
all the way to ground of the strips

1324
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,040
and then also to ground of the power

1325
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,240
supply all grounds are together

1326
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,319
we then have power and that's going

1327
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,760
directly to the led strip

1328
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,960
to the power line and then data is going

1329
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,040
from our microcontroller

1330
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,839
to the data line on our strip

1331
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,839
hey so i'm kathy and i'm going to show

1332
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,599
you how to connect your

1333
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,880
led matrix okay so the first thing to do

1334
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,280
make sure your power supply is set to 5

1335
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,800
volts

1336
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,559
as you can see mine's set to 5 volts

1337
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,559
and then make sure it's off make sure

1338
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,000
the cigarette playground isn't plugged

1339
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,480
in

1340
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,240
everything's disconnected and we're

1341
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,839
ready to start

1342
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,800
so the first thing you need is a black

1343
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,000
alligator clip and we're going to

1344
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,319
connect we need to connect all the

1345
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,760
grounds here so we're going to connect

1346
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,480
it to

1347
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,920
ground on the circuit playground

1348
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:05,760
there we go

1349
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,599
and we're going to connect it to both of

1350
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,440
the grounds

1351
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,040
on the matrix so

1352
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,640
this one in the middle and

1353
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,640
this one on the first part the data in

1354
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,880
for the matrix and i kind of like to

1355
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,720
just hold them together like this

1356
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,160
and put this guy on here make sure it

1357
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,839
hits them both pretty good

1358
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,960
and then you want to connect that to the

1359
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,400
ground on the power supply

1360
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,960
and i usually just kind of chop it on in

1361
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,720
this case

1362
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,800
just like that and slide these down to

1363
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,160
cover it

1364
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,680
and make sure he's out of the way you

1365
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,440
don't ever want this to touch

1366
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,839
the power or your matrix will have a bad

1367
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,839
day

1368
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,160
and then the next step is get a yellow

1369
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,000
or blue or green

1370
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,559
of alligator clip we're going to connect

1371
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,079
it the data line

1372
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,240
connect pin a1

1373
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,119
on the circuit playground and i've got

1374
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,280
my my little resistor here

1375
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,400
so just connect it

1376
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,040
like so

1377
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:33,839
and if you have trouble with the

1378
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,000
resistor it is perfectly fine

1379
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,800
to skip it it's best practice but these

1380
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,040
will work without it

1381
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,400
so you've got that you're going to

1382
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,480
connect that to the data in

1383
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,800
on this left side of the matrix

1384
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,440
then once you've got that the last step

1385
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,880
is to connect the power

1386
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,240
from the power supply to this 5 volt pin

1387
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:11,839
on the middle of the matrix like so

1388
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,599
and yeah at that point that's the three

1389
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,160
connections we've you've got uh

1390
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,079
three grounds the one from the circuit

1391
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,319
playground and two on the matrix

1392
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,599
are tied to ground on the power supply

1393
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,599
you've got power on your matrix

1394
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,160
connected to power on the power supply

1395
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,440
and you've got pna1 run

1396
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,839
into data in on the matrix

1397
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,400
cool so now we're ready to turn it on

1398
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,839
i'm gonna go upload code and come on

1399
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:52,559
back okay and

1400
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,720
here we are i've uploaded code and i'm

1401
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,680
ready to uh

1402
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,760
turn this on the first thing we're gonna

1403
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,079
do is power up the power supply

1404
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,680
it's no big deal this time because we're

1405
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,160
not powering anything off the board

1406
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,920
but if you are you really want your

1407
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,960
power supply on

1408
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,520
first so that there'll be enough power

1409
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,599
for whatever lights you have plugged in

1410
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,680
if you have too many lights plugged in

1411
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,400
like running them off the board

1412
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,760
without uh like

1413
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,040
external power it's very easy to

1414
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,280
make your arduino freeze up because it

1415
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,280
it can't power itself

1416
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,119
so we're gonna turn the power supply on

1417
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,720
first turn it on or plug it in

1418
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,480
and then we're very carefully going to

1419
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,760
plug in our

1420
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,680
micro controller just like this

1421
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,400
and there you have it it lights up uh

1422
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,200
yeah make sure

1423
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,079
nothing shorts you always want to keep

1424
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:50,799
ground

1425
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:53,760
and power like a good way away don't

1426
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,960
don't let those two touch

1427
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,200
it's a bad idea but anyway yeah this is

1428
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,480
a little bit

1429
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,839
washed out but you can see our lovely

1430
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:02,319
patterns

1431
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:05,760
and uh this file is on github for you

1432
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,440
it's uh it's called

1433
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,480
color palette matrix so yeah check that

1434
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,040
out

1435
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,319
and uh thanks for coming see you

1436
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,079
you now know everything you need to know

1437
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,000
in order to use a matrix or an external

1438
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,040
strip

1439
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,040
feel free to give it a try and if you

1440
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,960
have any trouble feel free to contact us

1441
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,480
