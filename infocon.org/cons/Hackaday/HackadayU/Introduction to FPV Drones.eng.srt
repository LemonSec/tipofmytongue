8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,320
or my youtube channel where i talk about

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,720
their electronics now over the past many

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,240
years i've been building programming and

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,880
flying

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,720
unmanned aerial vehicle especially

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
high-speed racing drones meant for fpv

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,400
drone racing and freestyle

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,679
that's the like one sitting here

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,680

building these drones

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,120
the physics behind it the electronics

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,879
and also the software component

25
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,800
that helps keeping this flying camera in

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,879
air we also want to touch upon different

27
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,160
applications of the drone

28
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,680
and how they are being used around the

29
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,680
world from saving wildlife

the office hours so sign up today

36
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,039
and let's build and fly together
