hi

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,040
i'm karen rucker and i currently work as

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,200
a spacecraft radio frequency telecom

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,239
engineer i have a background in antenna

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:16,800
design

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,439
and amateur radio and i've partnered

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,279
with hackaday to bring you all

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,439
introduction to antenna basics as part

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,880
of hackaday u

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,800
in this class i'll be discussing some of

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,240
the fundamentals of

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,039
radio frequency engineering needed for

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,640
antennas and you'll learn some of the

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,520
fundamentals

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,960
of antenna design anyone interested in

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,559
taking this course should have a basic

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,840
high level understanding

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,440
of circuit theory and network analysis

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,360
we hope you'll join us for introduction

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,640
to antenna basics

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,239
and i look forward to working with you

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,800
all
