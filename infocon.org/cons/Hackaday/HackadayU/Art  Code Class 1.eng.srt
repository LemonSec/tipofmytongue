2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,120
hello

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,400
and welcome to the class art and code

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,200
i am super excited to have you here and

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,640
super excited to just get into it so

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,840
this is an exploration of p5js which is

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,359
a javascript library

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,199
we're going to be looking into the ways

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,039
that one can use p5

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,800
to create art pieces online and then

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,480
we're also going to talk a little bit

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,960
about

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,440
art theory and composition and the ways

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,120
that we can pull that into the digital

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,880
space

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,079
you're going to see me looking down from

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,920
time to time that's primarily because

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,840
i'm running my slides on my computer

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,480
which is

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,960
down here but i'll try to be here with

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,200
you as much as i possibly can

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,600
so a little bit about me before we get

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,120
into the material just so you know what

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,079
you're getting

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
i am casey hunt and i am a

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,320
student at the cu atlas institute i am a

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,000
creative coder and web designer

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,320
and i spend a lot of my time in p5.js

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,840
specifically i think it's a great tool

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,199
so i'm really looking forward to

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,520
teaching you

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,920
so first i want to just talk about what

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,600
we're going to be going over today

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,200
and what you can expect out of this

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,360
class period basically every class is

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,119
going to be structured in a very similar

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:17,840
way

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,720
we'll go over some art theory stuff then

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,439
we'll go over

40
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,520
some technical stuff and the ways that

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,200
it relates to p5.js

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,640
and then we're going to have some sort

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,320
of code demo each day

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,159
so today we're going to talk about

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,759
generative art and

46
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,119
the ways that p5js and generative r work

47
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,600
as a team and then we're going to talk

48
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,720
about color theory

49
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,040
and the ways that one might expand color

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,880
theory into the work that you do

51
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,040
in a piece of generative art and how to

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,680
create gender generative color schemes

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,920
and then we're going to explore the

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,840
actual creation of generative color

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,399
schemes

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,920
inside of p5.js so

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,640
first of all what exactly is this class

58
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,960
what are you getting yourself into

59
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,280
this is a breakdown of our course based

60
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,439
on each of the four class sessions so

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,119
today we're obviously talking about

62
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,720
color and the ways that you would

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,878
structure your code for a basic p5.js

64
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:11,760
sketch

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,200
the next class we're going to talk about

66
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,360
recursion and motion and the ways that

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,080
you can create

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,200
motion graphics using p5.js in our third

69
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
course we're going to expand that

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,000
into natural movement and also recursive

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,959
functions so

72
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,640
some more advanced programming is going

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,080
to happen in week three

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,840
and then in week four we are going to

75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,000
explore using other people's data

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
via apis and other people's

77
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,040
computational power

78
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,480
in order to create something that

79
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,000
interacts with the natural world in some

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,160
way

81
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,840
so just again a quick overview of the

82
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,519
way each day is going to work

83
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,560
you'll be here seeing some inspiration

84
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,319
some pictures some things that i think

85
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,080
would be useful to you in creating your

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,879
piece

87
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,400
we're going to go over some art theory

88
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
which today happens to be

89
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,519
color theory and then we're going to go

90
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,120
into a code demo

91
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
these classes are released every monday

92
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,400
and then i

93
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,080
am around for office hours each

94
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,280
wednesday at 1pm eastern 10 a.m pacific

95
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,920
time

96
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,519
so you just log on to the zoom call

97
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,360
there should be information on

98
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,440
your class page about how to get in

99
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,560
contact with me

100
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,360
and i'll be there for an hour to answer

101
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,959
any questions about code or art or

102
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,319
anything that's come up for you

103
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,480
over the 48 hours since you watched the

104
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,239
video

105
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,879
so what are the most important parts of

106
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,400
our theory that we're going to cover in

107
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,080
this course

108
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,519
first obviously today we're going to

109
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,680
focus in on art theory that's about how

110
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,200
to pick color combinations that

111
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,720
harmonize with one another i think of

112
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,120
this

113
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,480
very much as being similar to

114
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,239
like a music theory course where you're

115
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,920
creating harmonies so we're learning how

116
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,319
to create harmonies in our colors

117
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,599
then we're going to talk about

118
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,519
composition and that will happen during

119
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,519
our motion graphics course which is next

120
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,400
class

121
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,519
that has to do with the way that you

122
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,760
balance your piece and where you

123
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,959
put each object on your canvas in order

124
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,799
to create a piece that

125
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,159
has some flow and is aesthetically

126
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,280
pleasing in the way that things are

127
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,200
placed out

128
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
in our second and third class we're

129
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
going to talk about gestalt psychology

130
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,959
gestalt psychology is a form of

131
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,880
psychology that focuses entirely on the

132
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,279
way

133
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,320
humans perceive things and it's very

134
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,959
interested

135
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,479
in motion and also in the ways that

136
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,160
people see shapes on a page

137
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,759
so it's super relevant to the work that

138
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,520
we're going to be doing here and

139
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,040
that will be a part of our overview in

140
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
class 2 and class 3.

141
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,919
we are going to cover math for art so we

142
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,360
are going to get into this in

143
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,639
class 3 primarily the ways that

144
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,120
a complex piece of code utilizing

145
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,280
trigonometry and recursive functions can

146
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,440
create a beautiful piece of generative

147
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,040
art and motion graphics

148
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,160
so we're going to talk a little bit

149
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
about trigonometry why that's valuable

150
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,800
to you

151
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,120
and how you might use that in your code

152
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,560
and then of course the last day of our

153
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,919
course we're going to talk about data

154
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,600
and apis and the way you can use other

155
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
people's data

156
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,080
to create a piece that interacts with

157
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,520
things that physically exist in this

158
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
world like weather data

159
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,159
or population data or things like that

160
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,639
so i just want to give you some

161
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,160
information about what i think

162
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,960
makes you most successful going into

163
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,240
this course

164
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,320
this is completely self-guided as you'll

165
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,000
be hanging around with me in

166
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,080
video form but i won't be physically

167
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,759
there to be on top of you

168
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,199
and even in a physical space

169
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,680
there are a few things that are

170
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,440
incredibly important to your success in

171
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,080
a classroom especially as an artist

172
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,479
i strongly encourage you to view growth

173
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,360
as a practice

174
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,520
so i consider this class to be sort of

175
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,199
like an exercise course

176
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,280
i'm going to give you the structure of

177
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
the exercises you should be doing i'm

178
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,080
going to tell you how to do things in a

179
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,800
way

180
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,039
that will be non-damaging that will get

181
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,639
you in a positive direction

182
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,880
but developing your own artistic style

183
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,080
and developing your own artistic

184
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,039
sensibility

185
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
always comes from practice so it's

186
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,680
vitally important that you take the time

187
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
to practice your art skills outside of

188
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
this hour that we dedicate to each other

189
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,880
each week

190
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,039
i also also strongly encourage you

191
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,280
to embrace your discomfort when you're

192
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
engaging with this material so each time

193
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,639
you feel uncomfortable

194
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,000
that is your brain saying this is

195
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,600
something i've never done before this is

196
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,639
unfamiliar

197
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,400
and in the case of a learning

198
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,880
environment that's a great thing to lean

199
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,680
into and really explore so when you feel

200
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,520
uncomfortable ask yourself why you might

201
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,560
feel uncomfortable

202
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,960
but truly try to lean into that feeling

203
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,319
as much as feel safe

204
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,520
and doable manageable for you

205
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,360
because that's where the learning truly

206
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,720
truly happens this is

207
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,240
quite similar to the way that you would

208
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,840
go into a weightlifting class

209
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,360
or any sort of physical exercise again

210
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,000
you get the most strength increase in

211
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,840
the last couple of reps the parts that

212
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,599
are quite uncomfortable for your body so

213
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,280
the more you can push through

214
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,199
in those last reps the better you're

215
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,560
going to get

216
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
at art and the more you'll get out of

217
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,599
this course

218
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,520
and the last thing that i strongly

219
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,840
encourage you is to keep moving forward

220
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,240
i put a picture of a tortoise here some

221
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,840
tortoises are known for

222
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,440
only moving forward they don't have the

223
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,960
ability to walk backward

224
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
and i think that's super important to

225
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,639
bring to your art and to the work you do

226
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,680
in this class

227
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,479
i even am very very

228
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,000
commonly up against this stressor of i

229
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,280
don't like this piece i want to start

230
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,319
from scratch

231
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,720
and it's important to remember that each

232
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,919
step you take forward

233
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,280
is a step and so starting from scratch

234
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,639
is doing you a disservice finish up a

235
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,199
piece

236
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,800
even if it's not your favorite piece get

237
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,240
it to the finish line

238
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
and then start a new piece from scratch

239
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,840
rather than just completely eliminating

240
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,879
all of your code

241
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,160
when you feel like you're tangled up

242
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,240
inside of it take a break

243
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,840
but don't delete your code once you've

244
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,599
written it it's important to generally

245
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,840
speaking have a positive direction

246
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,479
so i include this quote here from andy

247
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,680
warhol it says

248
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,759
don't think about making art just get it

249
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,840
done let everyone else decide if it's

250
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,720
good or bad

251
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,400
whether they love or hate it while

252
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
they're deciding make even more

253
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,840
art i include this because i feel like

254
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,360
it encapsulates all three

255
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
of those things that i think will make

256
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,039
you super successful in this course

257
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,520
the always moving forward the being

258
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,879
uncomfortable

259
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,000
and the putting the effort in

260
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,680
you're learning the most when you're

261
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,599
actively creating art

262
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,280
and when you're not worried about what

263
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,719
other people think about the art that

264
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,320
you're creating so the moment you find

265
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,159
yourself critiquing your own work

266
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,080
in the midst of it bring yourself back

267
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,919
to the content of our art theory

268
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,958
discussions

269
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,200
and then let it go move forward create

270
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000
something new

271
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,519
don't worry about it because the more

272
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,120
you worry the more energy you're wasting

273
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,920
on something that

274
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,560
is not creating so that's why i felt

275
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,760
this was important to

276
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,160
set the stage for this four-week

277
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,800
exploration

278
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,040
all right so now we're getting into some

279
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,519
of the material of today's course

280
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,440
and i want to give you the opportunity

281
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,800
to just

282
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,640
kind of switch your brain into the gears

283
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,040
of p5js and generative r and learning

284
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,000
so we are going to talk about what

285
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,640
exactly

286
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,600
p5js and generative art is i'm going to

287
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
show you some examples of generative art

288
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,560
and then we're going to talk about why

289
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,800
p5.js is the tool that i'm choosing to

290
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,760
use to backdrop this entire exploration

291
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,120
so p5.js is a tool it is

292
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,200
something that we use to create code

293
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,240
that puts a piece of art onto the screen

294
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
generative art is the material that we

295
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,920
will be exploring today in this course

296
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,399
so

297
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,279
generative art is defined as something

298
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,040
created as a collaboration

299
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,760
with the computer and it's an art piece

300
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,880
that changes

301
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,519
based on the code that you write so

302
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,080
typically

303
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,240
collaboration looks like utilizing

304
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,360
someone else's data

305
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,880
or utilizing randomness or utilizing

306
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,360
some sort of output that the computer

307
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,640
provides to you

308
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,680
so i have here

309
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,760
a little bit of time to talk about what

310
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,839
p5.js is specifically

311
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,839
so as i mentioned at the beginning of

312
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,880
this video

313
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,360
p5.js is a javascript library so that's

314
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,279
basically something that stacks on top

315
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,399
of javascript

316
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,760
to make it optimized for creating art

317
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,480
and it's quite easy to create art pieces

318
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,839
with p5.js

319
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,760
literally we are going to make some

320
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,880
shapes in

321
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,440
about 20 minutes and those shapes are

322
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,640
just going to be

323
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,959
circle at this position on the canvas

324
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,480
with this radius so

325
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,519
truly p5js is a super

326
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,920
simple super easy to access tool for

327
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,360
creating art

328
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,640
p5 belongs inside of a suite that

329
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,800
includes another library called

330
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,760
processing

331
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,200
processing is the java library

332
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,160
for creating generative art pieces so

333
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,880
p5.js is mostly optimized for creating

334
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,839
experiences

335
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,040
online utilizing javascript and

336
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,000
processing is typically used for

337
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
generative art experiences that are

338
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,360
going to be projected

339
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,440
or will be run on a pc or a mac

340
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,079
like on the hard drive of that computer

341
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,040
so

342
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,200
they are both very similar in the way

343
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,560
the code is structured and you'll be

344
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
able to take the information you learn

345
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
in this class and translate that to

346
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,360
processing quite easily

347
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,680
however processing tends to be more

348
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,040
optimized for doing things

349
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,079
locally on a computer p5.js is great for

350
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,399
embedding things in websites and using

351
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,120
things online

352
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,320
what we're looking at here is the page

353
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,200
where

354
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,120
you will actually be editing inside of

355
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,959
p5js

356
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,040
if you want more information about p5

357
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,600
you can go to the website p5js.org

358
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,279
we're going to dive into the editor and

359
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,200
the documentation a little later in this

360
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,680
class

361
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,160
so just stick with me

362
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,079
as previously mentioned generative art

363
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,680
is the result of collaboration between

364
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,880
an artist and their

365
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,160
machine so this type

366
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,040
of collaboration can look like a random

367
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,760
number

368
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,560
generator purlin noise which is a type

369
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,079
of random number generator

370
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,839
that is designed to create

371
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,200
more natural random numbers it was

372
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,399
designed

373
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,399
by a computer artist with the

374
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
attempt to create something that's a

375
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,920
little bit more

376
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,120
natural and a little less truly random

377
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
on the left hand side here this creator

378
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,399
tyler x hobbs

379
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,399
is using purlin noise to create this

380
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,600
beautiful beautiful

381
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,800
piece of art oh

382
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
another two things you can use to create

383
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,320
generative art is a collaboration with

384
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,839
artificial intelligence

385
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,320
this is becoming popular and has become

386
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,600
popular in the last like

387
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,240
two three years truly we will not be

388
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
exploring artificial intelligence

389
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,800
inside of this course however there are

390
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,360
some

391
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,160
pretty accessible ways to create art in

392
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,519
collaboration with artificial

393
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,639
intelligence

394
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,680
art breeder and deep dream google deep

395
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,399
dream

396
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,279
are both types of generative art

397
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,839
ai based experiences that you can access

398
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,959
online and they have

399
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,880
a graphic interface so feel free to

400
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,160
explore those if you find yourself

401
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,040
super interested in ai specifically the

402
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,720
last thing of course is data stream so

403
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,079
that's what we'll explore in our last

404
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,800
class

405
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,000
utilizing an api

406
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,560
i just have a couple of examples here of

407
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,160
pieces of generative art that i

408
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,800
personally thought were great examples

409
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,639
this is a white and

410
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,399
black circle but it's cut into pieces of

411
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,760
pie

412
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,120
each of these pieces of pie is a slice

413
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,360
from audio clips from

414
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,800
the solar system so they took the audio

415
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,360
files that are publicly available

416
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,720
through nasa

417
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,560
and then turned them into

418
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,600
visual representations for each planet

419
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,880
in the solar system so

420
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,440
there's one for the sun and then all of

421
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,480
the planets all the way

422
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
including pluto so i thought this was

423
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,440
quite lovely i love their use of

424
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,320
monochromatics and i really like the way

425
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,160
that they've added texture to this piece

426
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,199
as well

427
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,040
this is something that would be super

428
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,240
accessible and

429
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,440
you should be able to do by the end of

430
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,920
this course

431
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,079
this is a quick little piece of motion

432
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:30,800
graphics

433
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,040
that are a generative art piece using a

434
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,160
physics engine

435
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,600
this is created by an artist called

436
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,079
cashflow and he's basically

437
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,600
using some physics engine particle

438
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,440
generators to move things around in

439
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
collaboration with some type of noise or

440
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,120
a random number generator

441
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,720
inside of this piece i just thought it

442
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,399
was really lovely and relaxing to watch

443
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:50,880
so

444
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,480
i'm sharing it with you for that reason

445
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,320
and also because this

446
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,839
monochromatic color palette these colors

447
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,440
are a really great representation of

448
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,839
some

449
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,639
simple generative color pieces that you

450
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,399
could bring into your art as well

451
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,040
this last piece that i've got for you is

452
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,240
by a person named andrew james art

453
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,360
these are electric field lines which is

454
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,760
what you see when you measure the

455
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,279
electricity and magnetism

456
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,440
of like a circuit for example so they're

457
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,320
taking some

458
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,040
scientific data and then exploring that

459
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
data in a generative art space

460
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,720
i thought that was just a really lovely

461
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,880
piece of art

462
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,519
so so far we've talked about an overview

463
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,480
of the class

464
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,720
and i've given you a little bit of an

465
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,759
idea of

466
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,639
what p5.js is where it fits into the

467
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,320
suite of internet tools

468
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,800
as well as what generative art is and

469
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,639
how those two things kind of get along

470
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,639
in a conceptual space

471
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,639
now we're going to start diving into our

472
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,279
little art theory lesson for today

473
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,399
before we move ourselves over into

474
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,240
learning the basics of setting up a

475
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,759
sketch in p5

476
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,839
and creating some generative art pieces

477
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,160
that specifically explore color and

478
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,120
color theory today

479
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,320
so color theory is

480
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,759
a way of adding some mathematical

481
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,959
equations or some rules to the ways that

482
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:17,759
colors get

483
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,000
used and mixed together in an art piece

484
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,399
that make them the most aesthetically

485
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,040
pleasing

486
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,959
so we're going to explore some of the

487
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,680
basics of how to make art look good

488
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,920
utilizing color there are two

489
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,560
main color models and these just have to

490
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,680
do with the

491
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,120
the physics of color so essentially

492
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,199
there are two ways to create a color you

493
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,600
can create a color by shining a light

494
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,680
or you can create a color by absorbing a

495
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,800
light

496
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,720
things that create color by shining a

497
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,800
light so think like an led

498
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,759
sign outside or your computer screen for

499
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,800
example

500
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,920
have an additive color model and things

501
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,440
that absorb light

502
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,600
like pigments that you paint with on a

503
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,639
page have

504
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,839
a subtractive color model so

505
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,400
in a computer representation space we

506
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,959
associate additive color models with rgb

507
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,240
and hex codes and if you are

508
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,880
creating something for pigment so that

509
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,160
would be the case if you were going to

510
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,439
do some sort of printing

511
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,280
you would want to utilize subtractive

512
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,959
color which is typically

513
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,119
cmyk so a visual of what additive color

514
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,960
and subtractive color actually look like

515
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,840
when you're utilizing them

516
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,240
basically all of our g and b

517
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,039
mixed together will make white so light

518
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,400
plus light plus light

519
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,160
makes pure white on the other hand

520
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,200
cmyk which is an absorbent spectrum

521
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,360
creates black so if you were to mix

522
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,039
together all of the pigments in an

523
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,880
entire kit of acrylic paints

524
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,120
you would come out with a like a muddy

525
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,880
deep muddy brown or a black

526
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,799
something that absorbs as much color as

527
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,799
possible

528
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,600
so your computer screen utilizes

529
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,200
additive color mixing and that's because

530
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,679
your computer screen is generating light

531
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,760
this is of course what a computer screen

532
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,440
looks like when you're super

533
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,600
zoomed in so if you were to take like a

534
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,440
microscope or

535
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,559
um a macro lens or something to look at

536
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,760
your computer screen

537
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,960
you would see sets of three lights

538
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,679
red green and blue all right next to

539
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,640
each other

540
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,840
so one of these little segments is

541
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,280
a pixel on your computer and the fact

542
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,679
that your computer is utilizing

543
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,320
additive color mixing again that's when

544
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,840
you mix all the colors together and you

545
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,679
get a bright white

546
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,320
we are going to utilize rgb for all of

547
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,039
our color studies from here on out

548
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,080
and rgb is what's traditionally used in

549
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,960
the internet space you can utilize hex

550
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,919
or rgb

551
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,880
but hex codes are non-numerical and so

552
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,039
they don't lend themselves as well to

553
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,039
creating generative art using color

554
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,559
you'll see what i mean in a bit when we

555
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,640
get into our demo

556
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,760
so here is a model of what the

557
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,799
rgb color spectrum looks like if you

558
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,160
put it out into three directions so one

559
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,880
axis of this graph is the color green

560
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,559
one accesses the color red

561
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,679
and one axis is the color blue so the

562
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,200
side that's closest to us

563
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,720
represents all of the combinations

564
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,039
between the color blue and green with a

565
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,720
fixed value of red

566
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,320
and the side that is sort of

567
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,039
next to it represents all of the colors

568
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,760
that

569
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,000
red and green create when blue is at its

570
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,559
highest value so you can kind of see

571
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,520
why rgb is important and how rgb is

572
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,880
actually laid out inside of a

573
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
three-dimensional space

574
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
i'm hoping this will help you understand

575
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,799
the ways that people conceptualize color

576
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,799
inside of this digital rgb space

577
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,840
so in our code rgb is represented by

578
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,760
three values separated by commas

579
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,159
the first value is for the color red the

580
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,760
second is for the color green

581
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,559
and the last value is for the color blue

582
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,960
so

583
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,120
rgb000 represents a color that contains

584
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,240
no light so no color this would

585
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,679
represent the color pure black

586
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,640
on the other hand this is a color that

587
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,200
has

588
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,080
all of the red the green and the blue

589
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,400
the

590
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,440
maximum value of any

591
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,720
number in the rgb spectrum is 255

592
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,000
that's just because of the way that the

593
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,919
bits are stored in the computer

594
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,600
so 255 255 255 is pure white

595
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,640
if the red green and blue values use are

596
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,200
equal

597
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,799
when you put them into your code you'll

598
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,559
get something that's grayscale so

599
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,280
whenever you have the same value of rg

600
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,159
and b

601
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,480
you're getting something that has no hue

602
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,679
only brightness

603
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,960
so this 100 100 100 color is going to be

604
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,559
like a darker gray color

605
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,280
because it's in the bottom third of 255

606
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,840
and

607
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
all of the values for rg and b are the

608
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,360
same

609
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,280
whenever you have a situation where

610
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,840
you're representing all three values rg

611
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,240
and b

612
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,000
at the same number and you're going for

613
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,440
something that's grayscale

614
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,159
you can represent them in your code as

615
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:18,559
just

616
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,679
a single value so rgb 100

617
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,760
is the same as rgb 100 comma 100 comma

618
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,400
100

619
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,640
i really like to utilize the color

620
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,960
picker that google provides just inside

621
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,919
of their

622
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,640
interface if you go to google and type

623
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,320
in rgb color picker

624
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,919
you'll see what i've included in this

625
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,440
slideshow here so

626
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
just a color picker that displays the

627
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,480
value of

628
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,760
red green and blue and the ability to

629
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,919
grab it off of the slider this can be

630
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,440
really great so you're not just feeling

631
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,880
around in the dark trying to figure out

632
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,000
what color you want

633
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,159
you can actually utilize the rgb picker

634
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,360
on google

635
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,200
or if you wanted to use something like

636
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,840
photoshop to pull a color out of a photo

637
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
you can do that as well the only value

638
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,360
we're looking for here is just those

639
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,159
three numbers

640
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,840
how much red how much green how much

641
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,080
blue

642
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,559
we are choosing to use rgb instead of

643
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,080
hex codes i briefly mentioned this

644
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,960
earlier

645
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,360
that's because rgb is a numerical

646
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,720
representation of color

647
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
whereas hex codes are translated into an

648
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
alphanumeric representation

649
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,280
you typically see hex codes in web

650
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,360
design and brand development

651
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,600
you'll see them on a brand guide for

652
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,480
example

653
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,080
they're really great for communicating

654
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,400
color across a wide spectrum

655
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
however they are not great for

656
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,480
generatively creating color

657
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,039
so we're focusing in on just rgb

658
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,760
so this is an opportunity for you just

659
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,000
to do a quick little self check

660
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,039
i have a color here and it's 255 comma

661
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,159
zero comma zero

662
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,760
so you should be able to answer for

663
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,679
yourself what color this would represent

664
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,760
in your code

665
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,360
if you have any questions about it you

666
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,960
can go to google and google this color

667
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,919
and see what it comes up with

668
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,720
now we are moving into the different

669
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,559
types of color palettes and color

670
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,400
pairings and the ways that you might use

671
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,240
those inside of a piece

672
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
we are going to work in the generative

673
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,480
space with all of them except for

674
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,679
tetratic

675
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,200
so keep an eye out for that because

676
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,640
we're going to come back to it later in

677
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,400
our code

678
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,840
so the first color that we are going to

679
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,480
explore

680
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,760
is monochromatic color spectrums people

681
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,120
commonly use monochromatic as an easy

682
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,360
cheap way to do a single color print

683
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,200
so you see it a lot in print work but

684
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,720
it's a great

685
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,080
simple elegant color palette

686
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,679
basically the way that you would create

687
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,279
a monochromatic palette

688
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,720
is you would pick the same value of

689
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,679
the hue so the same place on the color

690
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,240
wheel

691
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,919
and then you would just change the

692
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,600
brightness or saturation

693
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,960
of that color so here we see a light

694
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,120
blue that sort of just gets lighter

695
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,440
or a dark green that kind of goes

696
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,039
desaturated into a gray color

697
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,720
this is a complementary palette

698
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,159
complementary palettes exist

699
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,520
between two colors that are on the

700
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,279
opposite side of the color wheel so

701
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,080
for example red and green appear in

702
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,559
almost

703
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,679
all traditional christmas stuff

704
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,320
and they go really well together because

705
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,720
they

706
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,960
are complementary colors these color

707
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,240
pairings tend to make for

708
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,600
very striking color palettes that have

709
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,320
extremely high contrast you also see

710
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,240
them frequently as

711
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,400
sports team colors here is

712
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,039
two examples of a complementary color

713
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,480
palette so you can see

714
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,520
this dusty red and forest green that

715
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,960
makes for a really striking color

716
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,080
combination

717
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,640
i have kind of faded out this blue and

718
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,200
yellow

719
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,240
so you can see how different amounts of

720
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,880
brightness

721
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,039
can make the color combination more or

722
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,840
less striking as well

723
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,760
the next color combination is a triadic

724
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,960
color combination

725
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,159
triadic colors are a pretty complex

726
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,279
color palette

727
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,240
and they were really popular in memphis

728
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,320
design and 1980s design

729
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,400
any place where you're seeing lots of

730
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,640
colors a complex use of color

731
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,679
you're usually seeing a triadic or a

732
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,200
tetratic which we're going to talk about

733
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,679
in just a minute triadic colors are

734
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,679
equidistant on the color wheel so

735
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,640
essentially you go

736
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
straight across on the color wheel and

737
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,240
then you go over by two

738
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,039
on either side here's a couple of

739
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,799
examples of some really nice triadic

740
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,919
color palettes

741
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,279
in my opinion these are like really

742
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,279
great for doing interior decorating

743
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,279
and they work really well as generative

744
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,039
color palettes because

745
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,240
two colors can be a little flat in the

746
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,360
digital space but

747
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,120
three colors is really where you start

748
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,120
to see things look fleshed out

749
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,158
and like a whole piece

750
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,360
an analogous color palette is also a

751
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,640
three color palette

752
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,880
you can bring that down to two colors or

753
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,120
even take it up to four if you wanted to

754
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,960
essentially an analogous color palette

755
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,720
is taking colors from the same side of

756
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,919
the color wheel you're taking the

757
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,919
neighbors on the color wheel

758
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,799
and they end up looking more interesting

759
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,400
than a monochrome palette

760
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,480
but with a really low contrast so

761
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,080
they're very serene

762
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,080
they're very ethereal they're

763
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,159
pretty sophisticated looking palettes

764
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,840
they'd be great if you wanted to

765
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,080
evoke like something that was really

766
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,960
high class

767
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,600
for example

768
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,600
split complementary is

769
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,360
meeting in the middle between the

770
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,039
triadic color palette

771
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,960
and the complementary color palette so

772
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,880
as you can see here you're taking

773
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
the complementary color and then you're

774
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,720
going out by one color value

775
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,760
i personally tend to use a lot of split

776
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
complementary palettes in my work

777
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,080
i think they work really well for adding

778
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,880
depth

779
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,400
and adding some contrast without

780
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,159
things feeling loud and

781
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,559
christmassy or sports teamy something

782
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,240
that's so high contrast as a

783
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,400
complimentary palette this kind of eases

784
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,080
off of that just a bit

785
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,840
and it works quite nicely for just about

786
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,159
anything

787
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,440
the last color palette we're going to

788
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,200
talk about is a tetradic you can see

789
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,679
here

790
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,440
this kind of looks like a square or a

791
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,520
rectangle you're taking

792
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,120
the complementary color and then you're

793
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,000
going out by one on either side

794
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,039
so tetradic color palettes are typically

795
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,880
one of the most complex color palettes

796
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,080
that you'll see

797
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,120
if you want to use four colors

798
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,679
tetrad is almost entirely the only way

799
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,840
to go either you're grabbing from

800
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,520
one side of the color wheel or you're

801
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,440
splitting that complementary into four

802
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,159
different colors

803
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,880
i included a couple of artists here that

804
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,320
i feel like do color palettes really

805
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,880
well

806
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,320
they're great people to go to if you're

807
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,240
looking for inspiration on color

808
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,039
palettes

809
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,520
and they're remembered specifically for

810
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,960
their use of color

811
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,919
so vincent van gogh is coming up in art

812
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,440
around the time that people are mixing

813
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,200
their own pigments and so

814
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,600
his use of color is especially striking

815
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,320
because he's

816
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,039
such a master of mixing colors to make

817
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,000
things pop

818
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,279
so here you see a very traditional

819
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,120
complementary color palette grabbing the

820
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,039
blue and orange from opposite sides of

821
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,320
the color spectrum

822
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,840
and then exploring different

823
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,760
brightnesses of those colors

824
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,559
so this piece especially in person is

825
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,200
just

826
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,360
very striking it feels like it pops off

827
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,760
of the screen or pops off of the canvas

828
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,080
and that's because of that complementary

829
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,720
color palette being so high contrast

830
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,720
it gives this piece a lot of depth

831
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,799
this piece by kandinsky

832
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,399
is a great exploration of color

833
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,520
vasily kandinsky is a pioneer of

834
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,080
abstract

835
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,640
art who worked in the latter half of the

836
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,760
1800s up to the mid part of the 1900s

837
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,720
and he is known for his use of color in

838
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,760
abstract art

839
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
so if you're looking for some great

840
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,440
bright color pellets

841
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,960
or color palettes that speak for

842
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,720
themselves a lot of his work is

843
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,440
central around specifically the use of

844
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,039
colors so i strongly recommend you go

845
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,880
learn more about him

846
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,399
and then the last artist i am

847
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,279
highlighting is joseph albers

848
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,000
he did a lot of work around these

849
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
recursively placed squares

850
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,200
and they are almost always a great use

851
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,840
of color

852
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,640
so either in the monochrome space or

853
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,840
going full bore

854
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,559
into high contrast he's a great person

855
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,159
to go grab color palettes from

856
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,919
so go check out his work as well if

857
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,960
you're looking for some color

858
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,080
inspiration

859
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,200
this piece was made in 1977 so he's the

860
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,320
most modern of these three

861
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,120
and now we've come to the last part of

862
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,080
our class

863
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,399
we're going to spend what's left which

864
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,080
is about a half an hour

865
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,399
exploring generating color palettes in

866
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,880
p5.js and the ways to set up a p5.js

867
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,760
sketch

868
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,480
so i'm going to meet you over on the

869
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,360
website

870
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,360
i need you to go to editor.p5js.org

871
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,640
so i want you to meet me again at

872
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,120
editor.p5js.org

873
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,279
this is the website where we'll be going

874
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,000
to create all of our p5.js sketches

875
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,399
p5 is a javascript library and if you

876
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,279
have experience

877
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,880
importing and setting up javascript

878
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,600
libraries in a code editor like atom and

879
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,720
that's your preference

880
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,480
you are more than welcome to do that i'm

881
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,919
going to only cover

882
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,120
the web interface for p5.js the first

883
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,720
thing i need you to do once you get to

884
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,799
this website is create an account there

885
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,000
should be a button at the top of your

886
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,559
screen that says login or sign up

887
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,320
signing up to create an account for

888
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,480
p5.js allows you to save all of your

889
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,320
sketches while you create them

890
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,799
this is incredibly important so that you

891
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,559
can come back and work from where we

892
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,039
have

893
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,880
started in this course and you can

894
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,320
utilize these examples for your

895
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,720
reference later on

896
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,399
after you've created your account and

897
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,919
you're all ready to go we're going to do

898
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,840
a quick little tour of the p5.js

899
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,039
interface so you can see

900
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,960
what exactly is going on here and what's

901
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,480
valuable to you

902
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,240
so the first thing you'll notice when

903
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,000
you get to this page is that there's a

904
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,840
code editor on the left hand side and

905
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,880
then there's this thing that says

906
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,880
preview on the right hand side

907
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,720
in order to see the code that you're

908
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,559
writing you go ahead and push

909
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,279
the play button at the top of the sketch

910
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,360
and it will show you a preview

911
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,799
right now if you look at the code it's

912
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,720
drawing a background of 220

913
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,480
which is why you're seeing this gray

914
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
square because as you'll remember from

915
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,919
the work that we did before

916
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,440
220 would be rgb all of the same value

917
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,559
which is 220

918
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,840
and 255 is the maximum value so

919
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,320
220 is somewhere in the light gray range

920
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,519
which is why you're seeing a light gray

921
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,880
square

922
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
you'll see that your sketch is

923
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,159
automatically named

924
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,640
two words mixed together feel free to

925
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,159
name your sketch whatever you want

926
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,399
this first activity that we're going to

927
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,559
be doing is just an exploration of how

928
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,679
to draw shapes

929
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,600
just so you can get an idea of how this

930
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,960
space works

931
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,080
the last thing i want to draw your

932
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,320
attention to on this screen is

933
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,559
these sketch files so there's an arrow

934
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,440
next to your thing that says sketch.js

935
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,600
these will become important later on in

936
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,200
the course but it's important for you to

937
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,240
understand

938
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,360
that this p5.js sketch is actually a

939
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,600
part of an html environment

940
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,000
and inside of that environment they are

941
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,799
loading in

942
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,000
the p5.js library for you so right now

943
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,440
we can close out of this make sure

944
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,159
you've got sketch.js selected

945
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,080
you should see the same thing that i see

946
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,200
and you can just

947
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,640
minimize it using that arrow so

948
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,880
next we are going to talk about the

949
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,679
actual

950
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,760
use of the function setup and function

951
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,720
draw

952
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,760
function setup is run one time every

953
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,279
time you load your sketch

954
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,480
so function setup is what's useful

955
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,360
for creating still generative art which

956
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,120
is all we're going to work on today

957
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,799
so we're going to work entirely in the

958
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,200
function setup for this course

959
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,159
to our next class we will explore the

960
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,279
function draw

961
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,919
and inside of function draw this

962
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,080
actually updates at a frame rate

963
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,760
so you can for example

964
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,159
add something to animate to your screen

965
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,600
so i could

966
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,279
draw a square and increase the position

967
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,480
by the value of the frame rate or the

968
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,200
frame count

969
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,840
and then you'll see the square move

970
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,440
across the screen so

971
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,039
we're going to explore this in more

972
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,240
depth in classes two and three

973
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,640
but today we are going to focus all of

974
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,159
our efforts on the function

975
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,559
setup so meet me up at the function

976
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,440
setup

977
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,480
we are going to move our background to

978
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,399
the function setup as well

979
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,679
and that's because the background and

980
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,000
all shapes that are drawn on your canvas

981
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,919
are drawn in the order they appear in

982
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:04,880
your sketch

983
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,120
the draw function always comes after the

984
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,960
setup function so if we were to put

985
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,879
shapes in the setup function right now

986
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,639
without moving the background

987
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,480
we would cover up all of the shapes that

988
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,119
we create with that background color so

989
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,800
if for some reason you feel like you

990
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,239
should be seeing shapes and you're not

991
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,119
seeing them

992
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,839
that probably has something to do with

993
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,960
where your background

994
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,079
color is located inside of your sketch

995
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,639
just to draw attention to the fact that

996
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,879
the background is an rgb value i'm just

997
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,560
going to briefly show you what happens

998
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,320
if i add some other values

999
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,480
to this number you'll see that it

1000
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,719
changes so now i have something that is

1001
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,879
mostly red with a little green and no

1002
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,199
blue

1003
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,839
alright so let's talk about drawing

1004
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,440
shapes in p5.js

1005
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,359
and what exactly you need to do to

1006
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,359
structure your code to create a shape

1007
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,440
so i'm going to teach you the basic

1008
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,680
shapes for p5.js

1009
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,040
they're the shapes that i think are the

1010
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,880
essential building blocks of any of the

1011
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,079
work that we're going to be doing in

1012
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,440
this course

1013
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,160
and they're quite simple so the first

1014
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,960
shape we're going to

1015
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,280
create is a circle so just type the word

1016
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,240
circle

1017
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,440
the first value in this circle

1018
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,079
function is the x position of your

1019
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:18,720
circle

1020
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,079
the second value is the so x position

1021
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,079
y position the second value is the y

1022
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,680
position and the third value is the

1023
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,440
diameter of your circle so

1024
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,720
if i wanted to make my circle a little

1025
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,200
bigger i could have a diameter of 60.

1026
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,800
if i want to move it a little farther

1027
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,200
over to the left or to the right sorry

1028
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,560
my circle can have an x position of 150

1029
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,079
and say i wanted to move it closer to

1030
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,079
the top of my canvas i could give it a y

1031
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,599
position of 70.

1032
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,119
so i hope that kind of makes sense for

1033
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,960
you as to how things are placed out

1034
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,400
everything is measured in pixels and

1035
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,920
they're all relative to the size of your

1036
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,440
canvas so you see here

1037
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,960
the automatic canvas size that's

1038
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,200
initialized inside of the web browser

1039
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,920
is 400 by 400 all of this is going to be

1040
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,000
relative to that value

1041
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,839
the next shape that you need to learn

1042
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:02,960
for the work that we're going to be

1043
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,359
doing

1044
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,240
is a square

1045
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,760
wow if i could spell squares are very

1046
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,240
similar to circles in that they have

1047
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,440
a exposition a y position

1048
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,280
and then they also have a length a side

1049
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,320
length so

1050
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,520
i'm going to give it a side length of

1051
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,240
like 30 and then you're gonna see it

1052
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,280
appear at 300 300 which is

1053
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,880
towards the bottom and the right of my

1054
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,960
canvas and then it has a size

1055
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,200
on each side of 30 pixels the last

1056
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,079
shape that we're going to cover today

1057
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,320
that is a basic shape for p5.js

1058
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,240
is the triangle the triangle is

1059
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,000
x1 y1 x2 y2

1060
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,720
x3 y3 so i'll show you what i mean by

1061
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,839
that

1062
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,079
basically the first point of my triangle

1063
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,119
is going to be at 200

1064
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,160
200 the next point is going to be at 100

1065
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,200
240

1066
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,440
and the last point is going to be at 180

1067
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,800
150.

1068
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,359
so inside of this triangle you're not

1069
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,040
giving it lengths you're giving it

1070
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,079
side positions

1071
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,720
these three shapes can be infinitely

1072
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,680
expanded upon

1073
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,119
we'll explore a couple of others

1074
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,720
throughout the course but these are the

1075
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,040
ones that you need to get started today

1076
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,960
now there are a couple of things that

1077
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,800
you can do to change the appearance of

1078
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,760
the shape

1079
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,880
we are of course exploring color so

1080
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,760
we're going to do

1081
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,160
a color exploration next but the thing

1082
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,200
that you need to know

1083
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,160
about creating the color of a shape is a

1084
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,960
command called

1085
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,839
fill so fill creates the color that

1086
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,680
you're looking for and say i want to add

1087
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,560
a fill

1088
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,920
to my shapes of 100 100 100

1089
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,640
also known as just fill 100 i'll get

1090
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,839
this dark gray color

1091
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,200
which looks great on the light gray

1092
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
because i'm getting this monochrome

1093
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,040
type of visual here

1094
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,440
another thing that you can use to change

1095
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
the basic

1096
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,920
way that your shape looks is the stroke

1097
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,640
so

1098
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,000
the stroke can be removed

1099
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,480
using the command no stroke and now

1100
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
you'll see that my shapes

1101
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
no longer have an outside to them or

1102
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,119
i can change the color and

1103
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,520
character of the stroke by changing like

1104
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,040
the stroke weight

1105
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,960
so currently all the default stroke

1106
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,160
weights are one

1107
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,760
if you wanted a thicker stroke you go

1108
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,240
for like a five pixel stroke

1109
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,920
and then you'll see over here i have

1110
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,079
this default black color

1111
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,280
and it's got a very thick line

1112
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,160
and just by adding the name stroke we

1113
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,000
can change the color of the stroke so

1114
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,880
let's make the strokes just plain white

1115
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,079
and then you'll see them appear on the

1116
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,000
right hand side plain white

1117
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,400
so this is just a friendly reminder that

1118
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,599
your

1119
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,320
your sketch is not auto saved and you

1120
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,240
need to save it so you'll see i have

1121
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,359
a little circle here that indicates that

1122
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,599
i have not saved my sketch yet so

1123
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,200
this is the last that we're going to do

1124
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,119
with this example of drawing shapes

1125
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,440
go ahead and push the save button and

1126
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,480
now we're going to create

1127
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,400
a new sketch where we're going to

1128
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,839
explore creating some generative color

1129
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,040
schemes to create a new sketch

1130
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,640
go to file new and you'll get the same

1131
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,640
exact initialization that we got last

1132
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,440
time

1133
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,680
so we've got this function setup

1134
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,800
function draw

1135
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
and our background you'll remember from

1136
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,480
before that we want to make sure

1137
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,960
our background is the first thing that

1138
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,040
happens inside of our sketch

1139
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
and that's because we want to make sure

1140
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,320
that we're not drawing over

1141
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,760
any of the shapes that we are about to

1142
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,000
draw the next thing we're going to do

1143
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,560
is draw a couple of circles these

1144
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,760
circles are going to be

1145
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,000
what we use to explore creating

1146
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,520
generative color palettes

1147
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,200
inside of our space so

1148
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,960
this will give you kind of a starting

1149
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,200
point for creating some kind of

1150
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,680
piece where the color is generative and

1151
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,200
i'm going to show you how to make a

1152
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,400
couple of

1153
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,320
the configurations of color that we

1154
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,839
learned about in our

1155
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,200
brief little lecture utilizing

1156
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,680
the math random function inside of

1157
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,880
javascript

1158
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,960
so just remembering what we did before

1159
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,800
we're going to draw three circles

1160
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
i want them to all kind of be close to

1161
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,319
the middle of my canvas and i want them

1162
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,359
to all look

1163
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,880
the same so i want them to be the same

1164
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,040
size you'll see i have three circles

1165
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,680
here

1166
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,760
and they all started as white just by

1167
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,119
default

1168
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,240
so you'll remember that the first color

1169
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,880
scheme

1170
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,319
that we explored inside of our lecture

1171
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,160
was the complementary we explored

1172
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,760
monochrome and then complementary so

1173
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,920
let's do a monochrome exploration

1174
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,440
inside of these little tiny circles

1175
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,200
so we're going to add a fill

1176
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,200
and we want our fill to be um

1177
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,880
let's do like 100 150

1178
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,760
200 and now we'll see all of our shapes

1179
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,480
change and it's this lovely blue color

1180
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,720
so if we were going to do some sort of

1181
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,319
monochrome exploration

1182
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,400
inside of this fill what we would want

1183
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,599
to do is change

1184
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,119
only one of these values and we want to

1185
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,319
change them

1186
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,680
by honestly whatever amount

1187
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,800
we're going for so we could change all

1188
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,640
of them to change the brightness or we

1189
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,400
could change a single one

1190
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,359
to make this a monochrome exploration so

1191
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,119
i'm going to change

1192
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,839
the green value

1193
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,960
and leave the other two the same and

1194
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
then we see over here we've got

1195
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,240
a monochrome color palette that appears

1196
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,479
so

1197
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,160
in exploring our color palette you'll

1198
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,240
notice that each fill overrides the

1199
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,839
previous one

1200
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,520
we are going to create three

1201
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,119
four different versions of color

1202
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,960
palettes that use randomly generated

1203
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,480
numbers

1204
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
in order to randomly generate numbers

1205
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,240
for a fill we need to create some

1206
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,359
variables to hold these random values so

1207
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,240
to create a variable in javascript and

1208
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,920
in p5.js

1209
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,960
we're going to say let to initialize our

1210
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,720
variable

1211
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,800
and then i'm creating three variables

1212
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,839
one for

1213
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,640
a random value of red one for a random

1214
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,680
value of blue

1215
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,160
and one for a random value of green

1216
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:32,880
you'll

1217
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,839
need to make note of the fact that red

1218
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,520
or blue or green

1219
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,119
are in bold if you type them

1220
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,079
inside of your sketch that bold

1221
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,160
signifies the fact that that

1222
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,359
set of characters has a specific

1223
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,760
meaning inside of p5.js so it's vital

1224
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,720
that you don't

1225
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,200
name your variable something that means

1226
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,480
something else

1227
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,160
so that's why we're utilizing this

1228
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,920
random r random g

1229
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,520
and random b as the name of our

1230
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,599
variables the next thing we're going to

1231
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,079
do

1232
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,280
is on setup so when we first

1233
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,000
draw our canvas we are going to

1234
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
initialize the value of a

1235
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,760
random r a random g

1236
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,640
and a random b

1237
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,400
and we're going to use two default

1238
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,359
mathematical functions from javascript

1239
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:25,760
in

1240
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,480
javascript traditionally you need to use

1241
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:28,960
math

1242
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,400
dot and then the mathematical phenomenon

1243
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,680
inside of p5.js it removes that math for

1244
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,079
you

1245
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,400
so we are going to use first random

1246
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,880
which is a math function that generates

1247
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,800
a random number

1248
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,960
and then we're going to pass it the

1249
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,839
value

1250
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,400
0 and 255. so what we're essentially

1251
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,520
saying to the computer

1252
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,599
is i want you to pull a random number

1253
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,040
out of a hat between 0 and 255

1254
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,520
we'll do the same thing for all three of

1255
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,400
our color

1256
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,880
values

1257
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,480
random 0 255 and then

1258
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,160
the last thing that i'm going to do to

1259
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,400
show you why we need a second function

1260
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,480
is just go ahead and print these values

1261
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,640
so

1262
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,920
print will show the value of each of

1263
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,079
these variables

1264
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,119
inside of our console

1265
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,480
which is on the bottom of our screen so

1266
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,079
on setup we run

1267
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,160
our random variable and it looks like we

1268
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,440
got 85.59

1269
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,480
28.61 and 239.28

1270
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,240
now in order to keep things simple for

1271
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,839
the computer and simple for me

1272
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,319
i want these to be whole numbers this is

1273
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,760
a lot more important in

1274
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,839
other scenarios we can get away with

1275
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,599
using the decimals here but it's just a

1276
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,200
personal preference for me

1277
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,560
to include this floor function

1278
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,880
outside of the random and floor as

1279
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,880
you'll see in our console

1280
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,800
just rounds everything down to the

1281
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,520
nearest whole number so

1282
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,200
that makes our code just like a little

1283
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,598
cleaner

1284
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,839
and now we're only working with whole

1285
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,079
values of color

1286
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,200
so now we've created our random rgb

1287
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,079
value

1288
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,720
and we want to include it inside of our

1289
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,400
monochrome fill

1290
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,599
so i am going to label this monochrome

1291
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,240
using two backslashes to comment out the

1292
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,200
code

1293
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,440
and then i'm going to utilize this

1294
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,480
random r

1295
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,520
random g and random b to create the

1296
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,040
first fill which is this shape right

1297
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,680
here

1298
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,760
and then these two circles we're going

1299
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
to grab the value

1300
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,560
based on those variables random r random

1301
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,160
g and random b

1302
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,079
so in order to do that i'm going to

1303
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,839
paste them here and then we'll just do

1304
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,920
like a teeny tiny bit of math

1305
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,880
to create a monochrome color palette so

1306
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,560
right now we've got all the same

1307
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,480
and they are randomly generating each

1308
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,920
time i run my sketch

1309
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
so you see the value down here you see

1310
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,760
the color of fill over here

1311
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,079
and what i want to do next is create

1312
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,040
some

1313
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,440
variation inside of these values that is

1314
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,560
still

1315
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,520
a monochrome color palette so you'll

1316
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,800
remember that monochrome

1317
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,960
is only changing the

1318
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,119
the saturation and brightness of the

1319
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,119
value and you'll also remember

1320
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,680
that saturation and brightness are

1321
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,960
entirely dictated

1322
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,839
by moving these values up and down at

1323
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:32,560
the same

1324
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,200
amount so i'm going to add the same

1325
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,960
number to each of our rg

1326
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,119
and b to increase and decrease the

1327
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,720
brightness so

1328
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,760
i think we should add like 70

1329
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,160
because that's a large enough difference

1330
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,680
that we're going to see some variation

1331
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,400
but it's not

1332
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,640
huge and then i'm going to subtract 70

1333
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,440
as well

1334
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,200
so we have the same spread on either

1335
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,839
side

1336
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,119
so now you can see on the right hand

1337
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,599
side that i am randomly generating

1338
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,880
color palettes that contain three

1339
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,319
different values

1340
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,960
that are monochromatic so you can run

1341
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,000
your sketch a couple times and just see

1342
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,760
how that kind of pans out for you as you

1343
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,839
run your sketch

1344
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,839
so far so good now we're going to move

1345
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,160
on to exploring the complementary color

1346
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:22,640
space

1347
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,599
just as promised so we'll use the same

1348
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,400
backbone

1349
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,480
and then i'm going to comment out this

1350
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,880
code utilizing the control and then

1351
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,200
backslash button on my keyboard if

1352
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,960
you're using a mac you'll just click

1353
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,319
command backslash and then that will

1354
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,640
comment this code commenting code means

1355
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,839
that your code isn't running while

1356
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,040
you're running your code

1357
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,800
so now you'll notice that i have no

1358
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,280
circles on my preview

1359
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,440
all right so we're going to make a

1360
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,839
complementary palette

1361
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,079
and you'll remember that complementary

1362
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,319
palettes are when you move

1363
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,040
to the opposite side of the color

1364
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,000
spectrum

1365
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,160
so the way that we need to do that for

1366
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,520
our

1367
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,640
color palette generator is

1368
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,920
255 minus

1369
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,200
our random value so 255 being

1370
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,640
the value that is

1371
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:22,160
the highest for the entire spectrum it

1372
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,480
makes sense to then subtract from that

1373
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,960
255 minus random

1374
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,200
and because complementary color palettes

1375
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,960
only have two colors we don't need this

1376
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,079
last circle here

1377
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,839
so i am just going to go ahead and

1378
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,520
remove it

1379
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,359
and now you see on the right hand side

1380
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,640
we are generating

1381
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,799
random complementary color palettes

1382
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,359
super cool so i'm going to show you

1383
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,599
two more ways of generating color

1384
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,400
palettes

1385
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,040
a triad and an analogous color palette

1386
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,040
and then we will expand this color

1387
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,200
palette idea into creating a piece of

1388
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,760
art

1389
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,040
that changes colors and utilizes that

1390
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,960
random function to create

1391
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,480
some kind of work that is generatively

1392
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,880
colored

1393
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,359
okay so now we're coming into the home

1394
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,200
stretch on this exercise we're going to

1395
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,079
add

1396
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,480
our triadic color palette next

1397
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,240
so we'll do the same thing that we did

1398
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,240
before i'm going to

1399
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,280
paste my circle generator

1400
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,839
and i'm going to utilize that first

1401
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:30,720
random

1402
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,880
our random g and random b as our

1403
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,599
starting point

1404
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,520
so thinking similar to that

1405
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,359
complementary color palette

1406
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,280
we're going to do some math here to

1407
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,800
create the triad

1408
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,000
so you'll remember from our lecture that

1409
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,079
a triadic color palette is basically

1410
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,680
splitting the color wheel into

1411
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,640
three parts and we want to make sure we

1412
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,000
are

1413
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,800
taking that three parts and then

1414
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,880
subtracting it out of our

1415
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,920
random r so

1416
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,599
we're gonna do the same thing that we

1417
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,960
did for complementary

1418
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,880
except for instead of going to the other

1419
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,800
side of the color wheel we're going to

1420
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,680
go

1421
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,800
a third of the way across

1422
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,520
for all of our colors hopefully that

1423
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,720
tracks for you

1424
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,920
essentially what that looks like

1425
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,599
mathematically speaking is we're going

1426
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:22,319
to do 2

1427
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,760
times 255 divided by 3

1428
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,400
and then we're gonna subtract our random

1429
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,200
r

1430
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,640
from that value we'll do the same thing

1431
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,920
for our green and our blue and then

1432
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,559
we'll

1433
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,079
reverse that and add our random color

1434
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,280
to our 255.

1435
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:50,799
all right so now we are going to grab

1436
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,640
random oh

1437
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,760
random r and then add it to our 255

1438
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,960
and then same thing here just go ahead

1439
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,440
and add that

1440
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,240
and then last one we're gonna do it on

1441
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,599
our blue

1442
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,920
so essentially what we've done is split

1443
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,760
our color wheel into three parts

1444
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,440
and then we're moving around our color

1445
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,960
wheel this

1446
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,240
is kind of a pseudo triad

1447
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,559
color scheme and that's partially

1448
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,200
because of the way that rgb works

1449
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,160
it's tricky to create this mathematical

1450
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,440
equation and do it

1451
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,960
completely accurately so we're kind of

1452
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,240
cutting some corners here but we're

1453
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:32,720
getting

1454
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,960
the same essential effect of a triadic

1455
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,000
color scheme

1456
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,119
the only thing that is going to be

1457
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:38,720
different about your triadic color

1458
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,200
scheme

1459
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,760
is the brightness value and so if you

1460
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,359
find that your colors are coming out

1461
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,359
super light or super dark

1462
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:47,440
you can tweak around by adding or

1463
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,440
subtracting the same value from

1464
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,880
all three rg and b to create

1465
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,520
some depth or color so i want to make

1466
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,079
this

1467
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,480
third color a little bit brighter so i'm

1468
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,160
going to add 70 to all

1469
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,839
three of my color values

1470
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,599
oh yikes it looks like it came out just

1471
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,119
white so we'll do the opposite i'm going

1472
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,040
to take it a little darker instead

1473
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,240
there we go so now we are generating

1474
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,440
three colors that are

1475
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,280
equidistant on the color wheel they're

1476
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,680
all three

1477
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,680
they're all a third a third and a third

1478
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,160
which is a triadic color palette

1479
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,400
the last color palette we're going to do

1480
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,040
is the analogous color palette

1481
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,839
which

1482
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,480
i'll go ahead and start the same way oh

1483
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,800
so i'm gonna take this

1484
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,040
and then uncomment that code using my

1485
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,000
control backslash

1486
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,240
and then we can think about the

1487
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,359
analogous color

1488
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,720
palette as moving a sixth

1489
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,440
of the way around the color wheel so

1490
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,520
very similar to these thirds except for

1491
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,280
we're only going a sixth

1492
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,319
so we can take the exact same code

1493
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:08,000
remove that times two and then

1494
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,720
just go ahead and go like this

1495
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,160
1 6 of the color wheel 1 6 of the color

1496
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:16,960
wheel

1497
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,720
and then the same thing here and

1498
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,640
that color i'm noticing is coming out

1499
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,319
pretty dark so

1500
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,480
i'm going to add 70 to it so we can get

1501
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,240
some more

1502
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,800
depth than just the color black so let's

1503
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,359
do that

1504
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,839
and then we have to do the same thing

1505
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,599
for our second circle

1506
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,280
so again get rid of the two divide by

1507
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,640
six and basically this is just us moving

1508
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,359
our way

1509
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:48,559
around the color wheel by one slice

1510
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,000
which is exactly what the analogous

1511
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,839
color palette looks like i'm noticing

1512
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,520
that that

1513
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,000
this value is still coming out pretty

1514
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,880
dark so

1515
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,960
i'm going to make it a bit brighter even

1516
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,200
still

1517
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,079
now we have an analogous color palette

1518
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,280
generator so we've got

1519
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,440
an analogous a triadic a complimentary

1520
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,800
and a monochrome

1521
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,559
and you could do this same thing with

1522
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,400
all of the other color palettes

1523
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,079
just basically thinking about the color

1524
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,000
wheel as slices and then moving your

1525
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,240
way around it mathematically speaking if

1526
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,839
you are curious about the other color

1527
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:22,319
palettes

1528
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,079
feel free to come to office hours but i

1529
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,160
don't want to dominate our entire class

1530
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,119
time today

1531
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,160
just making color palettes

1532
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,000
so the last thing that i'm going to do

1533
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,440
is show you how to

1534
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,359
bring this same color palette generator

1535
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,799
into an actual piece of generative work

1536
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,680
so let's go ahead and save this color

1537
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,640
generator and

1538
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,079
create a new sketch

1539
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,000
now i am going to show you something

1540
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,079
that you could definitely do

1541
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,040
utilizing a loop or a recursive function

1542
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,400
this would work really well as a

1543
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,680
recursive function

1544
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,440
however i'm going to type it all out for

1545
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,880
you today just

1546
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,599
primarily because we're focused on our

1547
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,200
color generation and

1548
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,240
utilizing variables more power to you if

1549
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,760
you at home are able to figure out the

1550
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,280
way that you would do this

1551
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,960
recursively so essentially what i'm

1552
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,720
saying is if you want a little extra

1553
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,440
challenge

1554
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,640
try to figure out the way that you would

1555
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,559
write this code recursively

1556
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,400
so the first thing that we need to do

1557
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,079
same as before

1558
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:27,440
is initialize our random color variables

1559
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,200
and then inside of our setup function we

1560
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,040
have to create our random

1561
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,799
number generator so we have to actually

1562
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,559
assign that random value to each of our

1563
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:37,520
numbers

1564
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,920
so again i'm going to round down i'm

1565
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,599
going to do a random generator and then

1566
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,680
i'm going to go 0 to 255

1567
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:49,839
for each of these

1568
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,160
and then i need to make sure that i draw

1569
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,000
my background inside of my setup

1570
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,280
function so

1571
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,799
i am actually going to bring my

1572
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,480
background into this random number

1573
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,200
generator

1574
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,520
so we'll do that in just a minute but

1575
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,359
the first thing that i'll do is actually

1576
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:18,960
draw all these circles that i'm going to

1577
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,359
draw

1578
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,520
to create our piece so you can follow

1579
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,920
along with me and just draw them too

1580
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,200
this is just something that i thought

1581
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,920
was visually interesting

1582
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,359
and there's i think two four

1583
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,880
five ten circles that we're going to

1584
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,960
draw manually so the point of a

1585
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,640
recursive function being that

1586
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,319
it will speed up this efficiency a lot

1587
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,480
especially if you wanted to take this to

1588
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,359
the next level

1589
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,599
and add a whole heck of a lot of circles

1590
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,680
to your circle drawing

1591
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,440
we again will explore recursive

1592
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,520
functions in the next class and the

1593
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,359
class following that

1594
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:56,880
so this is just a way to

1595
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,400
kind of cheat the system a little

1596
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:12,000
okay so i've got these circles drawn

1597
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,400
on the bottom of my screen 75

1598
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,280
50. and now if i go ahead and run my

1599
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,160
sketch i see

1600
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,160
like this cool little circle drawing

1601
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,920
except for i would like this to look

1602
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,680
like one cohesive shape

1603
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,839
so what i'm going to do is remove this

1604
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,200
stroke so we're going to do that

1605
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,960
no stroke function that i showed you

1606
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,240
earlier and then

1607
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,520
now it's all going to look like one

1608
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,920
cohesive piece the other thing i would

1609
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,559
like to do

1610
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,079
is the same piece of circles but

1611
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,319
on the other side of my canvas and we're

1612
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,000
going to do that manually by typing out

1613
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:55,839
all of our circles

1614
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,960
so now we've got two identical circle

1615
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,160
blobby cloudy drawings that one is on

1616
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,680
the top of the screen and one is on the

1617
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,880
bottom of the screen

1618
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,559
the last thing i'm going to do is

1619
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,000
utilize our

1620
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,200
color palettes that we created to

1621
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,960
build this into something that can

1622
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,040
generate itself in lots of different

1623
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,799
color configurations

1624
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:37,680
so just as we did before the first thing

1625
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,480
we're going to do

1626
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,599
is create a fill utilizing just our

1627
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:42,319
random

1628
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:46,799
variables random r random g

1629
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,079
random v so now you'll see

1630
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,839
just the shapes that are on my screen

1631
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,880
are this one color now i would really

1632
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,680
like it if

1633
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,240
this top one was a different color from

1634
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,400
the one that i drew on the bottom

1635
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,760
so i'm going to do an analogous color

1636
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,640
palette which is the one where we just

1637
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,920
divide 255 by 6 and add it to our value

1638
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,839
excuse me okay so random r

1639
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,520
255 over six

1640
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:28,319
and then the same thing for green

1641
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:33,839
and the same thing for blue

1642
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,079
so if we go ahead and update our sketch

1643
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,480
now we see we've got our two shapes

1644
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,240
they're different colors but they are

1645
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,000
colors on the same side of the color

1646
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,599
wheel

1647
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:57,359
the last thing we're going to do is the

1648
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,680
same analogous calculation for our

1649
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,480
background

1650
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,920
but we're going to reverse it so we're

1651
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,359
moving the other direction around the

1652
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,799
color wheel

1653
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,880
so i'm just going to copy and paste this

1654
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,920
code

1655
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,119
and then subtract the value rather than

1656
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,880
adding the value

1657
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,400
now we've got this super cool color

1658
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,440
palette generator that creates this

1659
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,520
analogously colored piece of work

1660
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,680
but it looks a little bit different

1661
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,559
every time

1662
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,720
so this is a great first piece for

1663
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,480
exploring generative art

1664
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,920
today we went over the structure

1665
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,040
of a basic p5.js generative piece

1666
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,799
we talked about how to create a canvas

1667
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,599
how to color stuff how to create shapes

1668
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,760
how to place shapes on your canvas and

1669
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,599
then how to utilize the random function

1670
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:46,960
to create variables

1671
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,000
that are randomly generated you can also

1672
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,280
use the random function

1673
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,400
to for example randomly change the size

1674
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,280
of a shape

1675
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,720
so if i take this down to

1676
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,319
just two circles for example i can

1677
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:05,280
randomly place them or randomly size

1678
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:05,599
them

1679
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:08,880
so let's do wet size

1680
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,319
circle and then we'll randomly generate

1681
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,960
a number

1682
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,200
oh size circle is our variable name

1683
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,880
we'll randomly generate a number let's

1684
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,720
say between

1685
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,839
50 and 250 because i feel like that's

1686
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,520
good for the size of our canvas

1687
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,559
so let's do random

1688
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:34,000
50 250 and then i'm going to change

1689
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,680
this value to size circle

1690
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,720
and then this one as well

1691
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,400
so now we can randomly generate art that

1692
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,400
has circles of different sizes

1693
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,000
that also happen to work within this

1694
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,680
analogous color space

1695
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,119
and you can definitely take this

1696
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,799
randomness and explore it to its

1697
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:56,480
absolute limit there is a ton of stuff

1698
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,920
you can do just with the stuff that

1699
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,039
you've learned today

1700
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:00,960
by placing stuff around on your canvas

1701
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,280
randomly sizing stuff randomly on your

1702
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,039
canvas and randomly coloring things

1703
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:06,319
utilizing those

1704
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,599
color schemes that we talked about

1705
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,839
so that's it for our class today

1706
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:13,760
remember that next time we will be

1707
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,280
covering

1708
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,599
our motion graphics and the ways that

1709
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,520
one would use a recursive function to

1710
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,000
generate

1711
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,839
some really cool stuff on the screen so

1712
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,680
i'm really looking forward to next time

1713
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,359
today was kind of just our day to get

1714
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,039
our feet wet mp5

1715
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:28,319
get you familiar with the way to

1716
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,240
actually use the interface

1717
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,920
and get you starting to write some code

1718
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,680
a reminder that i'll be in office hours

1719
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,680
on wednesday so if you need any help

1720
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,520
with this you can ask me then

1721
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,960
if for some reason you don't get around

1722
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,160
to this and you still have questions

1723
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,839
about the first video in the second week

1724
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,119
or third week of the course

1725
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,599
i'm also there to be a resource for you

1726
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:48,640
then so

1727
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,880
thanks for joining me in week one of art

1728
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,480
and code i hope that you

1729
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,119
feel like you are able to take this and

1730
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,960
do some really cool stuff in p5 i can't

1731
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:03,599
wait to see what you end up creating

1732
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,680
you
