[Music]

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,880
welcome

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,480
everyone this is our 13th

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,560
hackathon hackaday session on quantum

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,160
computing

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,960
and also four sessions ago we started

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,439
doing more coding so this is what we're

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,000
going to do

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,279
also this class we will be

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,840
running some quantum cutters using the q

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,880
sharp

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,239
on the teleportation

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,840
algorithm i see quite a few new names

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,280
joining today welcome

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,039
and welcome back to people who have been

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,840
in this class uh for your information

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,320
all of the recording all of our classes

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,360
are recorded

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,399
and all the slides and recording will be

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,520
posted

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,640
on the hackaday project

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,719
so here's the link yeah if anyone wants

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,799
to post the link in the chat feel free

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,840
to do so

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,080
and i can also show that later

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,200
well the class is usually 13 minutes

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,680
and sometimes it lasts a little longer

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,240
we

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,680
spend every sunday discussing one topic

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,960
um so the format of this is

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,400
i usually go through some topic

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
theoretically and then show people the

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,079
coding

34
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,520
exercise we will do some coding together

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
and then we have some time after that

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,079
for q a the documentation that we use

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,920
is from the microsoft q sharp

38
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,200
documentation

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
and the coding exercises are the quantum

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,880
catalyst

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,759
so we'll go into that for teleportation

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,600
this class

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,640
just to show people where we are we have

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,920
already discussed the superposition

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,880
interference and entanglement concepts

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,159
and we also

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,200
saw the algorithm aspects

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,639
and linear algebra math aspects

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,280
about quantum computing we use the

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,000
quantum

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,080
computing language q sharp to do the

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,400
coding so that we can construct

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
some algorithms that would help us

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,040
get more intuition

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,319
so because last class we talked

56
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,599
again about entanglement and we use

57
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,640
the super dense coding as an example

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,000
this class we're going to reinforce

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
the understanding with a different

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,200
algorithm

61
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,879
as i mentioned couple times as

62
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,720
teleportation

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,920
but before that i and also because there

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,560
are

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,599
new comers today

66
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,599
here are the three most important

67
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,720
concepts

68
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,680
in the quantum computing when you get

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
started

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,840
and there are a lot of confusion in

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,440
these concepts

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,560
so i deliberated this

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
cartoon today to contrast between

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,519
what has been said in the media and

75
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,680
what has caused a lot of general

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,519
confusion in the general public

77
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,879
and we should think about

78
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,280
a different way to describe these three

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,080
concepts

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,440
the first one is superposition where

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,840
oftentimes is described as zero and one

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,879
at the same time

83
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,120
and that's often when people first

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,239
introduce qubits

85
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,920
they want to make a contrast with

86
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,760
classical bits

87
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,239
but then saying it's zero and one at the

88
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,000
same time is not really helpful for

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
people's understanding

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,560
what really is happening is that a qubit

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
is using

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,319
superposition which is a fundamental

93
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,200
quantum

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,400
behavior and if you write out the

95
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,200
mathematics

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,840
is nothing but a linear combination of

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,640
these

98
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,439
two states zero and one that your system

99
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,480
could be in

100
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,439
and your system can have a certain

101
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,599
probability of being in zero and certain

102
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,760
probability of being in one

103
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,080
these is uh these are using the analogy

104
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,040
of a coin

105
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,599
because like uh zero and y at the same

106
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,560
time doesn't

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,040
help with our understanding but then on

108
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,759
having

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,479
an analogy of a spinning coin having

110
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,240
half of the time

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,320
is um probably landing on zero or half

112
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,759
of the time are one

113
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,440
and these amplitudes

114
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,800
was used in the description here

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
and their magnitude squared are the

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,600
probabilities

117
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,280
the second most

118
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,320
often actually they're not even

119
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,120
discussed

120
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,800
in a lot of introductory

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160
articles that then if you

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,960
heard or learn physics at some point you

123
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
heard about wave function and they say

124
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,639
measurement is a collapse but that was

125
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,720
quite an old interpretation well we now

126
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,560
have understood is that measurement is

127
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,759
resulted from these amplitudes

128
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,919
constructively and destructively

129
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,520
interfering each other

130
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,960
so that the most probable result comes

131
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,520
from

132
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,600
constructive interference and that's

133
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,560
what we observe

134
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,360
in a measurement then the third thing is

135
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,840
about equipment

136
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,639
qubits wouldn't be useful unless we

137
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,759
entangle them

138
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,680
and they can give us really powerful

139
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,479
applications like what we see today and

140
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,039
also

141
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,840
we saw in super dance coding last time

142
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,560
but then

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,280
entanglement is often misunderstood as

144
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,919
this

145
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,560
mysterious einstein called his spooky

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,160
interaction at distance

147
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,240
when he didn't want to believe quantum

148
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
mechanics

149
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,960
that often is described as

150
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
changing one of the qubit the other one

151
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
will instantaneously

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
change at infinitely far

153
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,160
of a distance but that's not what

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,120
happens what happens is that we set up

155
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,039
qubits in entanglement

156
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,520
and we know that their measurement

157
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,160
results

158
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,720
will be correlated if we measure one of

159
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
them we will know the result of the

160
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,440
other

161
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
even if they are far away and

162
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,160
we don't even have to measure the other

163
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,000
qubit to know

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,639
what the outcome would be based on your

165
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,840
measurement of

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,759
your qubit if you have

167
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,120
learned physics in school in

168
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,720
academia maybe more than 10 or even 5

169
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,160
years ago

170
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,479
you may find that by learning quantum

171
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,560
computing some of the old

172
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,199
interpretation has to be updated so

173
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,599
let's

174
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,199
think out out of the box and

175
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,759
stop using some of the terms that are no

176
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,560
longer

177
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,080
the proper description

178
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,759
so let's recap what is how do we set up

179
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,560
entanglement

180
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,280
and in this particularly useful case

181
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,080
which is

182
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,440
setting up bell states these are a

183
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,479
set of four states that are putting two

184
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,960
qubits in entanglement

185
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,880
we use them in almost every algorithm

186
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,080
how do we set this up is

187
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,720
using just two gates that we learned in

188
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,240
previous classes

189
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,520
using a harama or h gate or a c naught

190
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,240
gate

191
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,720
for people who's just joining these two

192
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
lines means two qubits

193
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,080
and then these boxes are gates that we

194
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,440
apply onto the

195
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,560
qubit when we have some

196
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,759
controlled or connected gates we have a

197
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,120
line drawn to them

198
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,000
this one is a synod gate we did in the

199
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,280
last class so

200
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,440
it would be really helpful that you go

201
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,800
back if you haven't

202
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
seen the last class go back to that one

203
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,479
or go to

204
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,840
some previous ones to look at

205
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,840
the development towards today's class

206
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,280
so this is what happens when you apply

207
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,400
h gate onto zero and one you will put

208
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,599
these zero and one into a superposition

209
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,960
so these are two possible

210
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,919
outcomes depending on what your starting

211
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,479
qubit

212
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,760
is and then when you apply a c naught

213
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,839
you would then obtain these bell states

214
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,399
and

215
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,519
by doing so you are entangling your q

216
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,320
two qubits

217
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
so based on that we can set up

218
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,200
a fun algorithm called the teleportation

219
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,040
algorithm

220
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,000
what this does is it sounds it yeah it

221
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
sounds really sci-fi

222
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,120
it's like you're teleporting one from

223
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
one place to another

224
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
but what this one this algorithm

225
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,600
particularly does

226
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
is to allow two people

227
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,320
to share information without

228
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,519
actually sending their qubit

229
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,320
to the so one person doesn't have to

230
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,120
send a qubit to another person

231
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,160
so here we have the two

232
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
most used name in quantum mechanics

233
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,120
alice and bob

234
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,320
that's our characters so they

235
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,399
would prepare these sorry

236
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,680
i'm too far they will prepare these

237
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,160
qubits into a entangled state so using

238
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,440
the h gate and the c knot as we just

239
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,200
saw um but they

240
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,480
separate themselves they can go as far

241
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,720
away from each other as they want

242
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,160
and then alice obtains another state

243
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,279
another qubit we label it as a slash

244
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,120
she wants bob to know what this a

245
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,480
slash is but she cannot for some reason

246
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,560
directly send it to him

247
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,120
then she needs to do some trick to her

248
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,040
two qubits right now

249
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,480
she has her originally entangled qubit

250
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,519
with bob

251
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,399
and then she has this new one what she

252
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,720
has to do is to entangle

253
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,160
her own two cubits and then do

254
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,440
measurements on each of her qubit based

255
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,399
on her measurement

256
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,360
she can then tell bob using a classical

257
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,320
method

258
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,399
like calling him or writing a letter to

259
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,360
him

260
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,839
telling bob hey this is what i got so

261
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,320
based on my result you should do

262
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
either a axe gate on set gate or both of

263
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,320
them

264
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,079
to your qubit and then

265
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,920
when bob does so according to this table

266
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,640
he would

267
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,440
obtain that qubit that is exactly the

268
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:03,920
same

269
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,680
as a dash so this is teleportation

270
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,959
that's by

271
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,560
preparing entangled qubits and

272
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
and then separate them and then doing

273
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,880
further entanglements

274
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,519
transferring some classical information

275
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,720
to allow bob

276
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,680
to reproduce what alice has in her hand

277
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,880
so let's do this step by step

278
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,480
and we can look at the math step by step

279
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,680
as well as coding at the same time so

280
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,600
let's all go to this quantum tatas

281
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,880
this is you can search quantum codes or

282
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,399
go to this link here

283
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,920
i've already put it up on the right hand

284
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,639
side

285
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,680
on my screen if this is too small for

286
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,000
you you

287
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,399
can you can zoom in by doing control

288
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,720
plus and i will also do this here on my

289
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
screen

290
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,680
what we need to do is

291
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,600
to find the teleportation

292
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,040
tata over here

293
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,839
this is a set of exercises for learning

294
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,040
purpose

295
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,399
and we're using the quantum computer

296
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,200
language q

297
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,040
sharp to write out these algorithms

298
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,519
we can go to this jupiter notebook

299
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,720
option which then

300
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,240
opens up this exercise book on binder

301
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,200
online so there's no download this is an

302
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
installation free experience

303
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,040
but there are also options where you can

304
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,560
download the whole

305
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,760
github repo and to run it locally if you

306
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,360
want to learn how to do that

307
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,079
go to the microsoft documentation page

308
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,000
that will help you

309
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,120
go through the setup

310
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,320
so now what you need to first do is to

311
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,440
run the package

312
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,880
for this particular cata

313
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
and then let's just look at them step by

314
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,079
step let's

315
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,800
set up the circuit set up the algorithm

316
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,920
so the first step is asking us to

317
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,399
entangle through the entanglement

318
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,200
between alice and bob's qubits

319
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,760
there we were told that they are

320
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,959
initially

321
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,240
put in the zero state and

322
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,920
we also told that this is the bell state

323
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,959
that we want to put this system name

324
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,320
so if we're using this

325
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,440
as our target bow state

326
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:49,120
we just need to do the

327
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,560
this table exactly so if you look at

328
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
the target bow state is actually the

329
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,560
first one

330
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
and your two qubits alice and bob's cube

331
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,839
is already

332
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,519
in zero then you just have to do this

333
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,959
circuit so you apply the

334
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,959
each gate to analysis qubit

335
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,120
and then do a c naught for

336
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,880
using analysis as the control

337
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,399
and bob's cubit as

338
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,519
the target

339
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,800
if yours if your state starts with

340
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,360
any of the other ones then you will get

341
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
different bow states out

342
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,959
and if that's well you would first

343
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,079
usually when we start a program

344
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,320
all of the states are initialized to

345
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,199
zero

346
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,320
so if you're asked to do

347
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,959
this one instead you first need to flip

348
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,560
the second bit to a one

349
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,120
using x gate which we also learned in

350
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,360
previous classes

351
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,519
so now this is your setup which is

352
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,120
successful

353
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,000
and then i'm asking to send the message

354
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,800
now

355
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,519
but before that you have to do a couple

356
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,399
of

357
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,399
preparations so alice's

358
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,120
qubit she has one that's already

359
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,160
entangled there

360
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,560
but now she gets another qubit called

361
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,839
the q

362
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,399
message so that's our a dash here

363
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,839
uh what happens um immediately

364
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
when you first prepare alice knops

365
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,320
bowel states and then you will get this

366
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
and this is nothing but rewriting your

367
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,519
system into this

368
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,040
format so a three qubit system

369
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,360
you have zero zero zero zero one one one

370
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,120
zero zero one one one

371
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,720
options and

372
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,270
then is asking you to

373
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,360
[Music]

374
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,440
the circuit we know we need to set it up

375
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,680
as a c naught

376
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,079
and h later for alice's two qubits

377
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,920
you first you should do

378
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,360
c not this time

379
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,079
you're using the message as your

380
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
control

381
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,000
and then the next step is to apply the

382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,279
h gate to everything

383
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,639
to the to this q

384
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,320
max message after the c not so let's see

385
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,519
when you apply the c naught

386
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,399
if your control is zero nothing happens

387
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,480
if your control is one

388
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,079
the target flips so that's why

389
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,279
now here you have zero zero zero is

390
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,639
zero zero zero one one is still zero one

391
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,680
but one zero zero becomes one one zero

392
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,160
and one zero one becomes one uh sorry

393
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,079
one one one becomes one zero one

394
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,280
right makes sense now

395
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,400
uh after you apply the h

396
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,559
gate to analysis mu

397
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,280
your so in here the order is

398
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,160
this is your first qubit so all of them

399
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,880
entangled

400
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,400
states in superposition so

401
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,720
here you're just setting that up

402
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,640
but then uh oops

403
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,840
my

404
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,919
letter was done

405
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,080
okay so now you need to return

406
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,120
the measurement results of

407
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,480
your two qubits now

408
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,200
so following this you can see

409
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
when you're doing a measurement to the

410
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,520
first qubit

411
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,280
if it is zero then what you will get

412
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,400
is these two

413
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,840
terms out of these four terms because

414
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,280
it's impossible to have qubit being one

415
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,520
in this case if your measurement is zero

416
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,760
so these two terms get cancelled out

417
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,360
that's what you get when you do a

418
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,480
measurement

419
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,840
on the first qubit if it is zero

420
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,640
and if you do measurement to your second

421
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,039
qubit

422
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,200
and turns out it is zero this term will

423
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,600
not

424
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,960
no longer be there so we know that

425
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,480
this is the

426
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,039
term that's left over and then look at

427
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,640
what happens

428
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,000
as the third qubit

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,280
is this one here and that's exactly

430
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,640
what we started as a dash and that's

431
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,520
exactly

432
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,799
what alice what q message is

433
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,240
so knowing that

434
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,600
this table we can set up

435
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,600
if we entangle the two qubits

436
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,640
in this bow state we know

437
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,760
this truth table can be drawn

438
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,160
and then we know what to do to bob's

439
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,480
cubit in order to get them

440
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,160
so in this case is very easy both

441
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,880
first qubits are zero and nothing needs

442
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,240
to be done to bobs

443
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,120
but if your measurement of the second

444
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,720
qubit is one

445
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,320
then this term would

446
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,360
be the one that's contributing and this

447
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,840
one

448
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,760
will be gone and again

449
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,000
you have a plus here but now you have

450
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,600
alpha one plus beta zero

451
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,960
and is which is a flip of this one

452
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,000
and it is a flip of cube message so what

453
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
you have to do

454
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,799
is then applying a x gate in order to

455
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,520
flip

456
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,320
flip it back to this term

457
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,919
that's when your measurement is zero one

458
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,760
and if your measurement is one zero or

459
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,600
one one it will follow these

460
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,640
two outcomes so we

461
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,320
here just need to set up this circuit

462
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,600
so your measurement results

463
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,840
will be returned as classical

464
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,039
and mass measurement

465
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,679
in q sharp is just m which is

466
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,760
intuitive so classical bits

467
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,559
is either one or zero

468
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,400
in boolean it is true and fourth

469
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,919
fourth so you then

470
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,640
just tell it to return

471
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,159
to be one which then

472
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,000
is true truth

473
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,360
so this is how you set up so far

474
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,960
this part of the circuits then the last

475
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,799
bit is applying gate to bob's qubit

476
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,840
based on whatever outcome this

477
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,120
step gives

478
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,799
so bob would need to

479
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,320
apply gates based on

480
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,960
classical information that he gets so in

481
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,120
here they are boolean

482
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,159
labeled as bit 1 and bit 2.

483
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,480
and this is very similar from what we

484
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,840
learned last time

485
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,200
in super dance coding you just you're

486
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,919
setting up

487
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,120
a if function

488
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,600
you have table to

489
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,240
represent

490
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,120
if your first qubit is

491
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,640
1 then from this

492
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,039
table you see you have to apply exact

493
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,400
gate

494
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,520
either case if your first

495
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,720
bit is one so you do

496
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,600
a z to q bob

497
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,640
and then if

498
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,960
your second bit is one

499
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,919
you see here if your second bit is one

500
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,120
you need to apply x gate which are

501
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,479
these two options

502
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,480
there it is to be

503
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,760
how you set up uh something

504
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,559
is wrong then i spelled it wrong again

505
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,120
ah

506
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,840
wrong bracket

507
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,640
okay then

508
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,159
i will leave the very of the

509
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,440
and the next few setups for you

510
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,480
to finish but i wanted to point out

511
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,440
something

512
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,640
interesting later so this is

513
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,760
exactly so you basically

514
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
constructed the whole teleportation

515
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,960
circuit

516
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,840
using just three steps here one two

517
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,080
three and as seen here from math

518
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,480
you can exactly derive your results and

519
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,840
you see that this is

520
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,640
why this the algorithm works

521
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,000
so later on there are some

522
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,760
very interesting variations of

523
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,039
what we just did like

524
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,799
um see yeah if you start with a

525
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,240
different entangled pair

526
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,840
say this was the first

527
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,039
exercise and this was kind of

528
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,400
probably the easiest choice which is

529
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,520
for uh sorry very first option

530
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,360
of the bell state but you have all the

531
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,679
other three options you can use

532
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,880
so you can have this one as

533
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,080
your qubit as your entangled

534
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,039
qubits or this spell state or these law

535
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,840
states

536
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,760
then respondingly

537
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,200
this table has to change

538
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,000
so this will be a very good exercise for

539
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,720
you to go

540
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,159
through this exact same

541
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,760
method but then derive these

542
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,080
mathematical outcomes yourself

543
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,600
and it's actually very very simple um

544
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,240
it's nothing but having this minus sign

545
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,440
in different places

546
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,919
in these terms and based on that you

547
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,640
have to

548
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,240
adjust this table and but then the

549
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,880
teleportation still works

550
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,120
you still can transmit information

551
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,960
through sending without sending the cube

552
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,279
and

553
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,120
having bob reproduce your cubit

554
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,159
3.1 is actually also very interesting is

555
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,000
a variation and let's see if i

556
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,120
want to do this with you or just let you

557
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,440
do it yeah okay i can

558
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,600
um just show you this here

559
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,840
so

560
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,520
3.1 is saying that

561
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,960
we will do the teleportation algorithm

562
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,679
but we don't have to do measurement this

563
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,880
is the measurement free teleport

564
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,360
so this step here

565
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,120
the if part of the algorithm already is

566
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,559
telling you something that perhaps

567
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,159
we don't have to do any classical

568
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,919
readout we don't have to do any

569
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,520
measurement

570
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,720
using the if function but

571
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,840
what about something that's strictly

572
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,960
within itself

573
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,480
quantum and we learn about c not which

574
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,400
is controlled not gate

575
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,200
but we can use the con all kinds of

576
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,799
other gates

577
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,000
so here we can repeat the

578
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,480
step for the um

579
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,640
the quantum steps

580
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,840
like before so we make

581
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,279
entangled message and

582
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,120
q alice like before

583
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
alice

584
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,440
doing these if

585
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,480
functions here like

586
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,760
construct message step

587
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,640
we could say if

588
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,039
a message is

589
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,080
a certain value

590
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,200
i can apply

591
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,240
the z gate to bob's qubit

592
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,840
so we can do controlled

593
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,719
because you see that

594
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,880
the q message is giving you the result

595
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,480
of the first bit so

596
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,799
instead of having this classical

597
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,159
construction

598
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,679
we can just say use the message as our

599
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,799
control bit

600
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,360
for bob's bit we do a control

601
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,440
set similarly the second bit

602
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,039
is giving us the result of

603
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,840
the second

604
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,200
the second qubit is given as the result

605
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,559
of the second bit

606
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,480
so we can say that if

607
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,919
alice's outcome is such and such we

608
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,279
would change

609
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,080
bobs and the search answer is

610
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,440
telling us we would need to apply

611
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,200
the x so again

612
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,919
when your first bit is one you do set

613
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,679
when your second bit is one you do

614
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,840
x so instead of having some classical

615
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,799
part here

616
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,919
you can equally use a

617
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,440
controlled method and i probably

618
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,080
typed something wrong here and

619
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:54,559
i said control said message

620
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,840
oh there's not much expected

621
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,399
got an argument of type cubed

622
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:09,840
type qubit

623
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,080
i did this earlier and it was all right

624
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,840
maybe i would leave this for the

625
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,760
audience and figure out

626
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,120
why this will be the case

627
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,279
and i can take a look at the message

628
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,520
here if there's any

629
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,840
anyone spotted the mistakes i made here

630
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,200
kitty i think look first uh

631
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,320
argument should be a really not a single

632
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,799
qubit

633
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:51,840
the first argument

634
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,559
oh wait uh i think i might have

635
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:18,240
yeah i think that's what you said cena

636
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,240
we can look up the yeah okay

637
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,330
also we can go to

638
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,600
[Music]

639
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,039
our course soft

640
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
documentation

641
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,519
by the way this is the documentation

642
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,799
site for

643
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,080
quantum development kit

644
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,200
everything about microsoft quantum that

645
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,039
is public

646
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,039
you can find all kinds of gates

647
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,320
in the api references

648
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,000
so let's see

649
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,840
intrinsic

650
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:29,840
there's a control

651
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,640
how to i think for the interest of time

652
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,279
we can

653
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,640
look at this together later because i do

654
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,000
have a couple more

655
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,200
things to show and i will leave these

656
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,480
four people to uh to finish and then i

657
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,519
would also

658
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,039
recommend highly text four

659
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,240
which is the three entangled qubits so

660
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,200
you don't

661
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,799
have to you can entangle multiple qubits

662
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,360
and also i talked about

663
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,120
entanglements in previous

664
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,519
classes i don't remember which one but

665
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,559
it was

666
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,720
quite a few classes before and um

667
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,200
you don't have to limit your number of

668
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,360
qubits you can entangle multiple

669
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,440
qubits and i actually have a slide here

670
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,799
we we can intend on qubits to make bell

671
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:39,679
states

672
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,039
and we can entangle three qubits

673
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,240
and these are called the

674
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,120
ghz states based on three people's names

675
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,679
and when you have n qubits you can have

676
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,320
them also entangled

677
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,960
but then people may ask then are these

678
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,320
the only options

679
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,919
for entanglement for multi cubic

680
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:04,880
entanglement

681
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,679
no these are special cases and these are

682
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,639
maximally

683
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,000
entangled qubits so this exercise

684
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
here actually helps you see there are

685
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,159
other options of entanglement

686
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,040
and it helps you construct a state that

687
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,239
is not a

688
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,760
gh set but um gh

689
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,879
z is a special case for

690
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,480
uh three qubits so i would highly

691
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,359
recommend task force like

692
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,760
for your understanding and entertainment

693
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,040
and i will also

694
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,839
point people to this that when you

695
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,679
complete any of the kata

696
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,119
uh so that's usually how we do this i

697
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,800
do work on some of the tasks

698
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,639
but then leave some out for people to

699
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,320
finish you can pick

700
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,679
any of the kata and finish them and

701
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,160
post them on twitter or linkedin at

702
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,200
these so

703
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,160
i know that you have finished it post a

704
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,760
screenshot or photo

705
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,599
and you can get a certificate of

706
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,000
printable vector graphic you can print

707
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,200
out anything

708
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,880
so there are people who have already

709
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,200
completed but i've only

710
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,720
seeing some of the later topics people

711
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,040
complete the basic dates

712
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,079
but these are very interesting ones

713
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,040
later that you should

714
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,440
and another word about entanglement and

715
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,839
this was raised last class as well

716
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,520
that entanglement we can use them

717
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,280
like we showed in these algorithms that

718
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,880
could be

719
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,520
but they can also be very

720
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,640
disadvantageous they can be harmful

721
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,680
because

722
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,440
you can entangle once you don't

723
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,200
have a good control of your system that

724
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,960
you can basically entangle with your

725
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,640
environment and that

726
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,119
also includes your measurement systems

727
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:01,920
where

728
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,119
your measurement probe say is at the

729
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,760
atomic scale also quantum mechanical

730
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,839
and it can come in when you do the

731
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:10,800
measurement

732
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,000
if you don't control it nicely

733
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,280
carefully it mess up your your readout

734
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,920
your

735
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,160
whole system because your qubits can

736
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,119
entangle with the

737
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,160
measurement probe too so there is a lot

738
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,359
a lot of nuances in hardware development

739
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,880
and error correction that help to

740
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,079
take into account these coherence

741
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,200
the last thing i want to show

742
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,800
is these quantum development

743
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,280
workshop so we have this actual quantum

744
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,040
we launched and this is currently under

745
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,400
private preview

746
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,000
azure quantum is our cloud service

747
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,760
that microsoft produced to allow

748
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,359
anyone to run your q sharp

749
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,560
algorithm at your desktop or

750
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,599
laptop but then access

751
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,280
actual hardware through the azure cloud

752
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,200
and we are running a workshop to teach

753
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,240
pers how to do that and also what are

754
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,440
the resources

755
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,160
for you to develop further and learn

756
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,280
i'll be giving

757
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,480
a short introduction

758
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,440
talk and also my colleagues are talking

759
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,079
there

760
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,760
you'll be able to meet a lot of the

761
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,200
quantum professionals

762
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,240
in the company and as well as meeting

763
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,440
other quantum developers so

764
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,480
definitely sign up that is happening

765
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,320
on july 16th and

766
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,000
questions we can look at questions

767
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,440
right away but then you can also

768
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,800
post on the hackaday project

769
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,800
and if you find the answer to this one

770
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,560
in the documentation also point it there

771
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,079
the recording is

772
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,839
shared on hackaday as well as youtube

773
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,320
just a announcement next weekend we

774
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,280
we're

775
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,880
not going to do any class it's a long

776
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,640
weekend is july 4th

777
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,760
on saturday it's not particularly

778
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,599
relevant to a lot of people here with

779
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,280
darling not from us

780
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,040
but i just haven't had a holiday for

781
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,839
many many months so i would like to have

782
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:36,880
a long

783
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,240
weekend for myself so let's take a break

784
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,520
next weekend and also for people who

785
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,839
just draw in a class they can catch up
