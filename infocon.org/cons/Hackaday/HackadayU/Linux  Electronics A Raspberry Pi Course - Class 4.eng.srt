[Music]

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,679
welcome everybody to the last class

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,559
of linux and electronics a raspberry pi

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,280
course

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,400
today we're going to be doing a fun

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,680
a fun uh class we're gonna have a fun

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,560
class

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,960
this is where everything that we learn

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,960
comes together

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,439
and hopefully after this class you're

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,558
gonna be able to do some fun stuff

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,760
okay so now today we're gonna be i o

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,320
scripting we're going to be um doing

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,079
some scripting for the

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,360
pins that the raspberry pi has

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,320
uh and we're gonna be using three of

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,200
your of the

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,039
of the components that you got on your

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,879
kids

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,840
okay so a reminder from the last class

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,399
was

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,280
that there's a library called gpio which

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,079
we use

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,280
on the on python which comes by default

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,400
on the raspberry pi uh image

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,720
so there's two types of the uh

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,720
of way of of of uh declaring

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,680
which kind of numbering system you're

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,040
gonna be using

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,600
one is the board which is going to be

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
these numbers at the center

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,080
one two three four five six and so on

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,720
and

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,880
the other ones are going to be the bc

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,240
m which are the the numbering system

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,520
from the chip

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,520
that the raspberry pi uses for example

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
if we're using pcm we're going to call

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,079
this pin gpio14

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,799
but if you're using the board we're

41
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,759
going to be using

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,880
eight right

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,960
okay so um we're gonna do

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,320
again some blinking uh we we saw that

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,479
that uh the last class but today we're

46
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,680
gonna be

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,200
we're gonna add something more to that

48
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,440
so a little reminder and i'm going to be

49
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,599
explaining what we

50
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,680
uh in case you didn't accomplish during

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,440
the last class now i'm going to give a

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
full explanation

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,200
so an led is an electronic um

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,480
device or or part

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,440
that when you put current through it

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,400
it lights up so it converts current to

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,720
to

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,080
to light and it has a polarity which

59
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,720
means that

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,840
you don't you cannot put it in in in one

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
way

62
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,319
or in both ways you have to put it a

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,680
certain way

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,640
it's imagine a battery which you have a

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,720
a positive and negative

66
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,760
the led has the same polarity right

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,920
this is a resistor which you could

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,200
came with and this device electronic

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
device

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,720
doesn't have a polarity so you could you

71
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,440
could have

72
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,120
put it in one way or the other

73
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,280
but the led you should put it in some

74
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,840
way specifically

75
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,000
this is i like this image because it

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,680
tells you

77
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,920
how to tell which one is the positive or

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,920
the negative depending on which kind of

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,080
led you got

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,120
some leds have this part cut it off

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,440
so you can know that that's that's that

82
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,200
side is negative

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,159
what i usually do is that i found i put

84
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,519
the led

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,480
uh in front of a light and i see which

86
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,760
is the smaller part

87
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,879
inside of the the plastic

88
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,400
colored part of the led that's gonna be

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,159
the positive

90
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,040
also i don't know if you notice but also

91
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,920
depending

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,120
they come in two sizes so that's

93
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,360
that's uh that's also another way to to

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,680
see which one is uh which polarity each

95
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,640
one

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,239
not only the sizes but some leds have

97
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,000
this um bended this pin bended

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,920
so you can also know which one is the

99
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,560
positive for the negative

100
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,920
so um last class we i explained how

101
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,159
how

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,120
how each part of the breadboard

103
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,680
how how how it's been connected to the

104
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,280
other one so you can make a circuit

105
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,639
right

106
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,080
um so yeah here

107
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,440
as you can see this pin is connected to

108
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,160
through this cable and this pin is

109
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,520
connected through here

110
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,639
all of these pins but for the circuit

111
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,400
it's only connected to the rest to the

112
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,040
resistor for the circuit's sake

113
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,160
which makes a closed circuit here

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,199
which is redundant right

115
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,560
any and and once we put a

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,960
signal it should it should light on

117
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,240
so this was an example of what

118
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,800
um a simple led script

119
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,720
on python should have been or it is

120
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,680
um we create the python script we give

121
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,720
give it permissions

122
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,080
i as you see here it's missing the plus

123
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,199
x right

124
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,759
as we all know x because of uh

125
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,520
executable

126
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,560
and then you need to execute it after

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,960
you add all the lines on the screen

128
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,520
so let's go over over the script one

129
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
more time a little bit quick

130
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,240
uh here we imported here on this part

131
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,960
until here we import the library

132
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,960
and then we use this uh

133
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
um i don't know how to call it but let's

134
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,320
we use this part

135
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,800
to call it to say that we're going to

136
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,319
call it this way

137
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,120
in linux there's a command called alias

138
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,759
which is

139
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,680
is it's working like this one every time

140
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,960
you call this

141
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,360
the program knows you're meaning this

142
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,880
this is important because

143
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,880
if if we're not using this one we need

144
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,440
to uh put the raspberry pi dot in front

145
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:11,759
of

146
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,720
every time we put gpio on this program

147
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
specifically

148
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,120
um and then from the library time we're

149
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,080
importing the

150
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,960
the program slip which we're gonna be

151
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,919
using for

152
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,360
timing and delays uh

153
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,160
here we set some warnings off just in

154
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,560
case we don't want them on the

155
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
on the console to be popped up

156
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,880
then we set the mode which was which is

157
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,479
what we were explaining before um

158
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,360
the gpio uh system that we're gonna be

159
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,639
using is the board one

160
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,800
right you can use either one if you want

161
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,919
to test it that's fine

162
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,039
but you need to be aware of that and

163
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,160
we're setting it up as an output

164
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,599
gpios or general purpose input outputs

165
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,039
our pins on microcontrollers and

166
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,639
and single board computers as the

167
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,039
raspberry pi which they can act as an

168
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:07,520
input

169
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,560
or as an output you need to mod you need

170
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,240
to declare

171
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,120
how it's going to behave and then you

172
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,759
you

173
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,039
you put it into use for example here

174
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,960
we just use it we're just gonna use it

175
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,319
as an output

176
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,560
and this program this part of the

177
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,599
program from here

178
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,520
down while true in python means that

179
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,000
this is going

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
to run forever this is not going to end

181
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,599
so you just

182
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,080
for ever ending cycle as long as the

183
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,400
program is running this

184
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,160
part of the program is going to be

185
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,039
running so we use this part from here up

186
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:43,680
as

187
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,879
to declare things for the program

188
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,160
to to this down part of the program

189
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,280
run correctly so here

190
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,960
uh we do sleep one which means

191
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,520
you're going to stop the program for one

192
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
second

193
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,639
okay and then you do

194
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,680
you declare this pin as a low so you

195
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,520
we send a a g and we connect it to the

196
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,000
ground

197
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,440
signal and

198
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,000
then one second we stop it and then we

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,120
go high again

200
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,800
okay we'll put it high if you run that

201
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,080
program

202
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,520
then you're gonna have a forever

203
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
blinking for

204
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,720
uh and and it's going to blink every one

205
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,640
second

206
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,440
that's what you're going to have so let

207
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,320
me go ahead

208
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,760
and connect to me to my raspberry pi

209
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,120
okay i have it here already

210
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,680
so here we are on the raspberry pi

211
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,519
someone asked me to to put it on full

212
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,959
screen

213
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,880
let me see if i can put this um

214
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:09,839
more default size

215
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,480
a little bit bigger 20 maybe

216
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,920
oh no that's a lot but a second

217
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,800
let me put this

218
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,760
16 maybe yeah that's gonna be fine

219
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,040
okay so let's

220
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,640
let me enter to the here

221
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,200
so as you can see here i have a couple

222
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,800
of programs which you're gonna be

223
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,880
seeing this class today already made

224
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,080
so let's see the led

225
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,279
dot pi which is the one that we saw as

226
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,959
you can see

227
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,279
here

228
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
this is the same program that we had on

229
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
the on the on the presentation

230
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,640
so if i can if i run it python

231
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,839
3 led dot pi

232
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,440
you're gonna you're not gonna be able to

233
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040
see it but my led

234
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,560
is lighting up oh one important thing

235
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,000
which i almost was forgotten

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,959
um the resistor needs to be a certain

237
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,560
um a certain uh

238
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,600
amount of has has to have a certain

239
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200
amount of resistance which is

240
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,880
measured in ohms ohm

241
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,160
you can find it i usually once

242
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,600
when i uh if i ever forget i usually

243
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,800
search it on google i search um led

244
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,160
red resistor raspberry pi

245
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,200
and usually they tell me which one it is

246
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,040
after that as you can see they don't

247
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,480
have numbers

248
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,200
they use a something called color um

249
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,079
code

250
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,760
which you can also find on the internet

251
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,160
you can each color means something the

252
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,040
first two

253
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,760
means the first two numbers of the

254
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,800
resistor

255
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,839
the n resistance resistance

256
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,120
and the third one means that

257
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,000
that first two number are going to be uh

258
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,519
multiplied

259
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,200
by 10 up to the number that represents

260
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,320
the third one

261
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,120
okay so in case you don't know and you

262
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,839
don't want to go

263
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,680
too deep into that you can just search a

264
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,200
color code

265
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,800
uh uh adafruit has one and

266
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,040
many sites on the internet has one you

267
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,079
just put the colors and

268
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,240
it's going to tell you which resistance

269
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,839
you have in the hand

270
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,920
so each uh led uh depending on the size

271
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,200
and also the color

272
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,440
has different um resistance um

273
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,279
requirements usually

274
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,959
usually from there's you can put a 200

275
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,519
ohms

276
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,160
resistor uh in there and you're gonna be

277
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,639
fine

278
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,079
okay so

279
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,480
uh but in this case i mean in the

280
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,200
raspberry pi

281
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,959
okay so uh let's go over here

282
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,800
so yeah so as you can see i i

283
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,440
we're going to connect it to the 40 40th

284
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:17,839
pin

285
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,279
on the board um let's say

286
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,639
numbering system which is this one

287
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,920
i used this too so i connected the the

288
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,920
negative or the cathode

289
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,040
from the or negative part of the system

290
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,560
which you can just put it for example

291
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,240
the resistor could have been in positive

292
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,399
or negative for this case okay

293
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,240
so you could just put it here and

294
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,519
connect the positive

295
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,560
uh right on the led and the resistor

296
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,839
between this pin and this one

297
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,920
um i what i choose to do

298
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,079
was to put the negative right um

299
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,880
from from the resistor put the resistor

300
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,079
to the negative

301
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,200
or the cathode pin on the led

302
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,519
and the positive to put it on the gpio21

303
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,240
or

304
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,480
40th in the board nomenclature system

305
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,519
so this is the other uh

306
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,760
program that i did uh that that i'm

307
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
going to show you

308
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,320
the l this in this program the led as

309
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,279
you can see we have

310
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,600
this part almost the same but we changed

311
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,800
this part so i can

312
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,720
so you can see some cool things about

313
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,399
declaring the variable

314
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,959
uh a variable with the number of the pin

315
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:37,760
that you don't have to

316
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,000
change every time you need to be

317
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,079
changing from system to system or pins

318
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:42,639
from pin

319
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,360
you only need to change once the the

320
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,079
number

321
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,519
so you declare this variable called led

322
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,639
underscore pin as 40 which we're gonna

323
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,560
means that that's going to be the 40th

324
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,680
pin right

325
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,440
but that doesn't mean that now it's

326
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,720
going to mean here

327
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,600
once i call the setup function

328
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,639
and i call here so this and as you can

329
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,320
see this and this are the same

330
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,040
just i'm using a variable so here

331
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,279
um so then i declare it as a law as a

332
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:17,680
law

333
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,880
first so because um that's going to be

334
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,720
my normal state of the program

335
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,600
and then as you can see i made another

336
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,639
uh

337
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,240
right through which means this part of

338
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,839
the program is going to be run forever

339
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,399
here are some fun stuff

340
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,800
let me put it full screens i can so i

341
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,399
can explain better

342
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,320
so this program sub process as you can

343
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
see i imported

344
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,839
another library called superprocess this

345
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,800
allows me

346
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,160
to run commands on the linux console

347
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,040
but from the platform of python program

348
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,720
this is not the only program that does

349
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,279
that

350
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,920
this is not in any way so you can find

351
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,600
more programs in case but

352
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,639
this is um kind of a standard

353
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,560
and yeah so first of all

354
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,440
i'm going to call another variable and

355
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,000
i'm going to put

356
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,839
a string into it this string

357
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
i know it doesn't look like it but this

358
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,920
is a command from linux confine

359
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,279
which is for finding it there to find

360
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,800
uh or and search directories

361
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,079
and files in linux so

362
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,560
i'm i'm i'm looking for this file

363
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,720
in the same directory that this program

364
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,320
is running on

365
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,120
this program right now as you can see

366
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,399
here

367
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,440
the um led os

368
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,639
is in the desktop and if i

369
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,920
and if i do this by the way if you want

370
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,440
to stop a program

371
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
from running you just click or you're

372
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,600
just pressing your keyboard control c

373
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,480
which is going to uh keep is going to

374
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,000
trigger a keyboard interrupt

375
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
for the python console and it's going to

376
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,639
tell you to stop

377
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,720
this is going to here as you can notice

378
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
this is my my trace pack

379
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,440
that this is going to tell you when the

380
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,560
line stopped

381
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
so in case you want to debug it

382
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,320
sometimes it it it has helped me to

383
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,800
debug

384
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,320
when a program is stuck um so yeah as

385
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,000
you can see i'm in the desktop and as

386
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,040
you can see i have

387
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,580
the uh the led os program in my desktop

388
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,920
[Music]

389
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,040
so this program find here txt

390
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,680
we're gonna run it i don't think we have

391
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,720
yeah we don't have the

392
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,079
the the the file here txt

393
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,199
so i'm going to look for it

394
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,680
there's no file in directory if i do a

395
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,320
touch

396
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,920
here txt which is going to create it as

397
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,720
you can see it

398
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,759
right on top here and then i do the

399
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,040
program again

400
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,480
you can see that it is there

401
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,519
so let me delete it

402
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,839
there you go so we're good to go

403
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,559
so here's the program this is a way of

404
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,359
calling this

405
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,720
uh this uh function of this library

406
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,000
which is called which is called call

407
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,240
you put here the program you tell the

408
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
child to be true this is something

409
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,599
don't don't worry about this if you if

410
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,280
you're gonna use this program i suggest

411
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,160
you to read it

412
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,240
but for this purpose it's going to work

413
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,919
just fine

414
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,000
so i'm basically making another uh

415
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,240
shell to be popped up and it's going to

416
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
run this program

417
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,760
and the result of that is going to go

418
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,360
here on this variable that i just

419
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,039
created here

420
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,600
which is called process i'm going to

421
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,799
print process

422
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,240
and if process is zero

423
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,919
that means it's founded it found the

424
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,280
file

425
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,400
and and everything else any type of

426
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,360
any any type of other output is going to

427
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,280
put the led low

428
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,320
so i want you to try that to to make

429
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:08,640
this

430
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
you can also do more fun stuff as

431
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
putting the cron tab

432
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,120
uh to create a here txt every one minute

433
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,039
and and maybe uh putting here in

434
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,799
in if we found it put up some some

435
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,960
five second timer and then call the

436
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,880
process to delete it

437
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,760
that could be fun right so i'm going to

438
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
test that right now

439
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,280
hopefully everything goes well iphone 3

440
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,559
and the os

441
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
okay so as you can see it's going to be

442
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,280
running forever

443
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,640
right now it has a a a a

444
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,240
um output of one i don't know if you

445
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,799
remember

446
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,480
from i think it was the second class

447
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
where we were talking about the standard

448
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,480
output input output and error

449
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,520
so it's done usually a standard error

450
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,799
gives you a one as an output and as an

451
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,520
ascended standard uh

452
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,360
and if there's no error it's going to

453
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,320
give to be giving you a zero

454
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,880
that's why and let me let me check here

455
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,400
so you can see that it's the same

456
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,080
program

457
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,840
that's why when it's a zero

458
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,280
then the the the gpio uh

459
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,120
the pin 40 goes up and and it turns on

460
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,880
so um let me run the program again

461
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,000
and let me show you as i here create

462
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,520
a file called here txt

463
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,000
as you can see once i created it right

464
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,280
away it started to

465
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,039
to to to um find it found it

466
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,320
and then um the output became

467
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,678
zero if i delete it

468
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,320
you can see that it doesn't find it

469
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,840
so yeah that's what these programs do so

470
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,520
you can do this

471
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,720
like imagine you can do a um

472
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,240
um turn the led every time a backup file

473
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,159
is generated or something like that or

474
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,480
to or turn a

475
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,080
a uh something up like

476
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,600
a ac or something every time

477
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,440
the file the backup uh is made

478
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,240
with the crontab for example so you can

479
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,919
do phone stuff with this right

480
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,840
so this is a way to interface things

481
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,200
that are happening in the operating

482
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,960
system

483
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,760
to the real world with that with an led

484
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,280
so let's talk servos this is the second

485
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,799
part that we're going to be using from

486
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,120
the kit

487
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,720
um servos are a type of motor

488
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,240
that are are made from

489
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,880
three things basically a potentiometer

490
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
which is going to be reading

491
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
where the gear the outside gear is going

492
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,400
to be

493
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,840
uh a circuit of control which is going

494
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,559
to

495
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,520
be doing that conversion from the signal

496
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,640
give it you're given

497
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,760
from the uh microcontroller or the

498
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,240
single board computer

499
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,559
reading the potentiometer to be to make

500
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,360
sure that

501
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,919
when if you tell if you tell it to go to

502
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,760
somewhere

503
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,799
and it is already there the the circuit

504
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,799
knows and doesn't move the motor

505
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,120
and also to control the motor to move

506
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,840
whatever it has to go

507
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,919
so the motors that you have which is an

508
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:46,080
sg90

509
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,280
if i'm if if i'm not mistaken

510
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,799
has it it looks something like this

511
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,919
but smaller this is a bigger one okay

512
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,679
this gearbox are used to

513
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,120
put some to make the high

514
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,559
the high speed uh low torque

515
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,080
motor to convert energy into

516
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,880
low speed and high torque that means

517
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,280
that

518
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,120
you can move uh um

519
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,320
bigger things uh with with this kind of

520
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,360
servos

521
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,919
i mean with servos compared with

522
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,520
compared with

523
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,600
the motor that is inside of it okay

524
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,679
so they are controlled with something

525
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,559
called pwm which is a kind of signal

526
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,940
that you can get from

527
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,989
[Music]

528
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,840
controllers and single board computers

529
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,880
right now

530
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,840
the uh raspberry pi doesn't as i'm aware

531
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,520
is it doesn't have

532
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,799
a pin that has a pwm

533
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,080
let's say from the mic from the

534
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,200
controller that the arduino has

535
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,240
some arduinos most of arduinos have them

536
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,080
have have a pwm output if not you can

537
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,760
create it which i'm going we're going to

538
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,960
do here

539
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,760
in this in in this part um so

540
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,880
what a pwm means it stands for pause

541
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,960
uh with modulation that means that

542
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,760
you're gonna be sending a pulse and

543
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,799
you're gonna

544
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,240
this is the part that you're going to be

545
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,080
modulating right

546
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,760
you're gonna have a standard time which

547
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,679
is going to be like the hertz

548
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,880
that that device works with and then

549
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,320
you're gonna you're gonna change

550
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,360
the time the pulse is on and that's

551
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,159
gonna

552
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,360
mean something for the for the

553
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,159
for the part that is connected to if you

554
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,039
for example

555
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,960
call half of the time is going to mean

556
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
something if it's if it's full

557
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,480
or if it's low etc

558
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,840
so if we're talking about the servo and

559
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,159
how

560
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,480
does that means does that does that goes

561
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,200
with the servo

562
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,720
um if we send a pulse with the smaller

563
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,760
uh type of uh well i mean uh

564
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,559
the small pulse it's going to for

565
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,120
example go to zero if we go to the full

566
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,360
for the max pole it's going to go 180.

567
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,880
have in mind that the amount of degrees

568
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,279
that

569
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,240
the server that you have in other server

570
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,440
servers go to

571
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
is going to be independent so you you

572
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,640
need to search for

573
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,159
your model of um servo and so and

574
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,279
look for how many degrees does it have

575
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,000
the links that i'm putting down here are

576
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,400
really got a really good resources

577
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,159
to look for so um i'm probably going to

578
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,279
put them on the

579
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,240
on the class notes but you should look

580
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,880
for them okay

581
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,559
so how to connect the servo to the

582
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,120
raspberry pi

583
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,919
this servos the server that you probably

584
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,480
have

585
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,159
has three cables um color red

586
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,960
brown and yellow or orange i'm sorry

587
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,640
and the red ones means that's the

588
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,240
positive which you're going to connect

589
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
to the five bolts

590
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,880
the brown one is negative which is going

591
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
to connect to be connected in the ground

592
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,000
and the third one is going to be the

593
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,679
orange one which is going to be

594
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,039
connected which

595
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,919
to whichever pin you want to hook up

596
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:32,559
with

597
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,200
hook up with

598
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,159
so have something in mind some depending

599
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,039
on the

600
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,520
on the brand that you get you have a

601
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,679
different coloring system

602
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,720
usually the red stays the same

603
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,679
and the dark color which is probably

604
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,360
black or brown

605
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,640
is going to be the negative and the

606
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,440
other color in this case are yellow

607
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,320
orange and

608
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
white are going to be the signal so

609
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,360
that's

610
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,440
that's the pin that you're going to put

611
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,640
on the

612
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,400
on the pin that you're going to control

613
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,840
it with

614
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,480
okay so this is the program that we're

615
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,720
gonna be that we're gonna be running on

616
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,559
okay uh this is a standard right

617
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,760
here uh we called for the gpio pins here

618
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,960
we're looking for time

619
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,159
because we need to be um

620
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,840
to just uh to have some delay

621
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,080
remember that when we're working with

622
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,360
mechanical parts

623
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,480
sometimes you need time for them to move

624
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,279
so it doesn't matter if you it doesn't

625
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,159
matter that

626
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,240
if you take this out but this is

627
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,080
probably not this command

628
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,120
is is not going to end before this one

629
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,679
starts running so you need to put some

630
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,960
time between the commands

631
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,279
when you're working with motors as this

632
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,480
one or for example stepper motors

633
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,600
so it can move okay

634
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,640
so here um we're gonna be using

635
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,360
the eleventh pin of the gpio board

636
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,320
standard

637
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,559
and we're gonna put it as an output then

638
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,520
we're gonna call

639
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,960
the the pwm function from the

640
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,480
gpio we're gonna put it to this

641
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,000
pin and then we're gonna put the

642
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,520
um the hertz

643
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,080
that that server is working on okay

644
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,039
um this is the start means where is

645
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,159
going to start

646
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,480
um uh as for example the initial

647
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,640
movement

648
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,919
so here this is where the program starts

649
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,279
if you run this program let me do this

650
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,840
right now

651
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,520
let me show you that i have to some

652
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,600
program several

653
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,520
here here import the pain

654
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,600
set mode setup pwm start

655
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,799
and the duty cycles the duty cycle

656
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,919
is something that you can that you can

657
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,520
calculate of of of us

658
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,880
um the pwm that you're gonna be using

659
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,320
so for now you can just um for this

660
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,919
example you just can um

661
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,159
think that the numbers that you're going

662
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,240
to be putting here is going to be from 1

663
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,279
to 12.

664
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,200
so this is going to be one is going to

665
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,320
be let's let's say

666
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,360
the 0 degree from the servo

667
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,919
and the 12 is going to be the 180

668
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:38,320
180 degrees

669
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,320
so so

670
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,960
here i'm going to call it to the first

671
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,399
the zero degrees for example and i'm

672
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,240
going to call it into half

673
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,919
so let me run this one and three

674
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,840
several as you can see

675
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,880
i'm getting some warnings right so

676
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,360
have this this is what we disabled in

677
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,559
the other in the other

678
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,120
program which we have we have in here so

679
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,919
i i wanted to show you what happened

680
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,200
right now i don't know if you can hear

681
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,559
it but this my server is moving

682
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,000
um and it's moving from the zero to the

683
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,399
half

684
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,960
every two seconds you can change any

685
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,039
part of this program and it should work

686
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,559
just fine okay so

687
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,799
here i stopped it and my service stopped

688
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,039
too

689
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,520
okay

690
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,320
okay so let's talk about i square c

691
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,559
um

692
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,559
okay so i square c is a type of serial

693
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,760
communication

694
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,799
you can imagine that i square c is uh

695
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,679
as to the raspberry pi as the u as an

696
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,480
usb

697
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,159
is for the uh computer it's a way it's a

698
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,480
type of communication bus

699
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,000
that where where you can connect things

700
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,480
in the same two pins and you have them

701
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,840
communicate

702
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,200
uh let's say um all of them

703
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,799
up at the same time depending depending

704
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,159
on the the i square c uh bus

705
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,240
support supports many uh devices

706
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,919
if i'm not mistaken up to 260

707
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,970
and 56 um

708
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,399
[Music]

709
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,279
that's because of the addresses okay so

710
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:35,679
this

711
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,640
the ice cream c have has a number a num

712
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:38,960
and

713
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,000
a set number of addresses where you can

714
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,960
where you can um

715
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,960
put some device into it and you go and

716
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,039
every time you want to talk to that at

717
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,559
that device you're gonna call it for

718
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,000
that address and we're gonna be looking

719
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,720
that in

720
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,360
in a little bit

721
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
so first of all we need to do something

722
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
that we did on first class

723
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,919
which is going to be enabling the i

724
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:02,960
square c

725
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,159
interface okay in the first got us we

726
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:06,880
enabled

727
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,559
ssh i i showed you both

728
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,840
both ways uh the first one was

729
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,120
with the file once you flashed

730
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,640
the s the sd card and the vnc i think it

731
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,480
was on the second class in order for

732
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,720
for you to do this that i'm doing which

733
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,519
is like

734
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,720
basically team viewer like um

735
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,720
for the raspberry pi so we click

736
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,440
enable we could hit okay if it if it

737
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,559
asks us

738
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,200
to risk to reboot the raspberry pi you

739
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
should do it

740
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,880
if it's not then you should be fine

741
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,240
so um so the ice

742
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,840
the lcd that we got uh is supposed to be

743
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,360
a nice square scene

744
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,039
these pins are should be connected to

745
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,200
this

746
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,840
boy which is going to make if you ever

747
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,760
work with arduino you know that there's

748
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,000
a way to connect this raspberry pi

749
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,799
to an arduino connecting each one of

750
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,840
these spins

751
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,679
but once i found out that that you can

752
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,240
put this board solder it into it either

753
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,720
they come

754
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,279
solar or you need to solder it so you

755
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,080
put it

756
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,159
and you only need these four cables to

757
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,679
connect it to the arduino or the

758
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,480
raspberry pi

759
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,559
so this is way better you do you have

760
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,399
less cables more reliable it's

761
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,399
is it works as fast it's it's basically

762
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,799
the same

763
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,080
so if we're gonna connect it to the to

764
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,600
the raspberry pi

765
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,880
you should put the red one or the vcc

766
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,279
one

767
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,000
to the five volts right you have two

768
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
pins you can use either one if

769
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,279
i have my servo my led and my

770
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,720
lcd all connected at the same time so if

771
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,080
you can you can just put one in one uh

772
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,360
vcc and one in the other one

773
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
the g and d on the negative is going to

774
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,760
be on the negative right

775
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,360
and the other ones which are which are

776
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,640
the the two cables which we can see here

777
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,880
these are the two cables that that carry

778
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,640
data

779
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,399
one is called s sda

780
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,678
and the other one clc

781
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,840
notice that you should connect each one

782
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,200
of them to

783
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,279
the ones that are on the raspberry pi

784
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,880
for example you're going to connect the

785
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,760
sda

786
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,799
to the sda pin on the raspberry pi

787
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,320
okay and the sscl to the scl

788
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,279
of the raspberry pi

789
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,279
so we're gonna be we're gonna do

790
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,960
something that it's basically like

791
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,080
uh a lookout let's say let's look for is

792
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,120
something like we did

793
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,960
with the end map of the in the first

794
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,120
class to see what

795
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,240
ips are on the network this way we're

796
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,760
going to be looking

797
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,000
what devices are connected in the i

798
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,880
square c

799
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,800
uh bus on the raspberry pi

800
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,560
so let me clean this

801
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,599
oh and i was fine there so

802
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,040
we're gonna do a ls dev

803
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,119
which is going to show you which is

804
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,320
going to chose

805
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,839
other devices that we have on on this on

806
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,839
this directory

807
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,119
as you can see i have the i square c

808
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,520
one available some singapore computers

809
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,560
and some raspberry pi in some arduinos

810
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,760
excuse me microcontrollers are gonna

811
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,480
have

812
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,599
more than one square c bus so

813
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,119
have that also in mind

814
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,639
in case that for example um

815
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,920
which has happened to me before the i

816
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,040
square c

817
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,240
the the dubai for example two

818
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,280
um lcds and the both

819
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,200
and both of them has have the same um

820
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,079
addresses then you can also

821
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,680
simulate a nice c bus by doing by doing

822
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,599
a program

823
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,160
and seeing is is not going to happen

824
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,119
it's not going to

825
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,560
um it's not going to

826
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,000
work as operating system-wide like it's

827
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,560
going to

828
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,480
run in the program you can find it you

829
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,760
can see uh

830
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,839
software software um

831
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,240
i square c python and it's going to show

832
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,440
you how to make

833
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,680
the program is going to make uh it's

834
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,200
going to take two gpios

835
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,920
and it's going to make them ice cream c

836
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
bus

837
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,920
so that that's that usually happens if

838
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,000
you if you need to put more than one

839
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,480
um device and some devices

840
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,839
um what i mean is the same device

841
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,040
they usually can't come with the same

842
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,000
address some devices or some

843
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,040
manufacturers

844
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,160
know know about this and they

845
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,359
put some pins so you can change it so if

846
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,720
in case you're going to be using more

847
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,520
than one

848
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,480
you can change which kind of address is

849
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,079
going to appear on that device

850
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,599
so you don't have that problem so i have

851
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,119
this one right

852
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,040
and as we can see in the presentation

853
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,280
we're gonna to do a a

854
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,119
a command which comes from default on

855
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,480
the raspberry pi which is

856
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,760
i squared c detect and

857
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,400
with this flag we mean the first i

858
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,200
square c

859
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,400
device let's do i square c

860
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,920
man i square c detect so so

861
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,480
detect

862
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,880
the

863
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,720
here so let's look for what

864
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,520
that y means

865
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,240
okay there you go

866
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,160
oh okay

867
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,599
so let's do i square c detect

868
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,079
y one this is a map

869
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,800
of the devices that are here right as

870
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,440
you can see

871
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,400
my device is on three f

872
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
this is important and you're gonna see

873
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,480
why because

874
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,960
in order for us to be to talk to the

875
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,760
device

876
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
you need we need to know to whichever

877
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,480
we're talking to

878
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,799
okay

879
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,320
so here so the i square c driver that

880
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,000
we're gonna be using is you're not going

881
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,920
to be stuck it's going to be from a

882
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,880
third party

883
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,000
the link is down here you can just

884
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,720
search it

885
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,079
as circuit basic i score clcd

886
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,599
it's a good it's a good um

887
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,800
uh tutorial but we're gonna go down to

888
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,920
this part

889
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,119
you can read all of it we're gonna go

890
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,880
we're gonna go down to this part and

891
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,320
installing the library

892
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,240
the library is basically this code

893
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:33,200
you can just copy and paste it as i did

894
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,960
here is where i copied and pasted as you

895
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,400
can see here

896
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,599
lcd right chart

897
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,200
here let's see the right chart as you

898
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,680
can see

899
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,839
i just copy and paste it save it

900
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,599
as an i square clcd driver

901
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,359
dot pi let me see if i can

902
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,400
if i gave it the executable yes

903
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,960
i give them the executable um permission

904
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,400
and then we can just import that

905
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,920
that program which is this one to the

906
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,599
to the to the any problem that i wanted

907
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,320
to i wanted to be use

908
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,359
the lcd so

909
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,720
let me see here um

910
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,160
here okay so

911
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,359
something important for this um library

912
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,520
that we're going to be using again i

913
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,480
created the

914
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,800
the file you can name this whatever you

915
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,520
want but

916
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,760
you need uh i suggest you to put a very

917
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,599
descriptive name

918
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,040
so i created the file then i changed

919
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,240
the i square c bus and the address

920
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,800
that this library is was going to be

921
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,040
talking to

922
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,640
this is important so let me open

923
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,839
this um editor on the raspberry pi

924
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,279
and let me open this driver

925
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,000
in the beginning of the of the of the

926
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,680
file you can see that is there's ice

927
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
cross and this is address

928
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,240
by the way these configurations are

929
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,599
specifically for

930
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,520
this um library of driver okay so

931
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,119
you're probably going to find a couple

932
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,680
of ways to do this um on different ways

933
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,160
made by different people if you find if

934
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,040
you go out on your own

935
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,040
so the i square c bus we just put it

936
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,359
it came by default with zero i put it on

937
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,640
one why

938
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,000
because when we did the else the here

939
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,960
um let me do it again when we look for

940
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,240
the

941
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,240
um ls let's leave

942
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,440
we can just grab the s square c

943
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,280
right because we know how to how to

944
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,480
search for

945
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,359
free uh for a specific for a specific

946
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,160
query

947
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,279
inside of a result

948
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,560
here as you can see i got the sqrc

949
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,359
device

950
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,079
which is named one in case it was named

951
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:08,480
two

952
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,040
by or zero just in case you need to

953
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,119
change the library into one or zero or

954
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:13,680
two or

955
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,560
whatever so i change it to one because

956
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,160
that's the one we got

957
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,599
and also the address it came with 27.

958
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,119
some um i square c devices come with 27.

959
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:25,839
uh i see

960
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,520
lcd score c i change it to 3f

961
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,839
because again this is what we got

962
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,280
let me do one i square c detect again

963
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,680
with you guys

964
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,440
oops detect

965
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,280
y and one so you can see three f

966
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,640
so you change it over here

967
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,920
only this part save it and then we're

968
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,599
good to go

969
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,000
so the program that we're gonna be

970
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,480
looking at

971
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,359
is going to be this one uh you're going

972
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,240
to import it

973
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,440
again this this program should be made i

974
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,240
did it here

975
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,520
lcd this program

976
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,960
should be made in the same

977
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,800
directory that you have the driver in

978
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
for example i'm in the desktop i have

979
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
this the driver i'm importing it over

980
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,480
here and the first line

981
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,240
and i have the lcd.pi right here okay

982
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,839
so i have them both in the same

983
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,280
directory

984
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,800
i'm going to call it my lcd here this

985
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,839
function

986
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,200
the drop the lcd function of the of the

987
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:41,760
lcd

988
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,839
driver library i'm going to be called my

989
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:46,800
lcd

990
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,560
and then i'm going to call the function

991
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,720
display this string

992
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
which is going to be hello world if i

993
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,480
run this

994
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,720
here it runs on my on my lcd

995
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,359
in case this this should run if if you

996
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,160
have any problem

997
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,240
probably is because or either you don't

998
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,280
have the square c

999
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,240
and enabled if you want to make sure

1000
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,200
enable it

1001
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,880
i reboot the raspberry pi

1002
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,640
through the system don't disconnect it

1003
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,480
and connect it okay

1004
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,599
then check again the uh

1005
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,839
the drive the the square c bus that you

1006
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:22,720
have either

1007
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,839
zero one or two etc it should be one

1008
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,280
if you're using the raspberry pi 3

1009
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,319
and go for

1010
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,640
um here and then the address of

1011
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,640
your i square c

1012
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,760
lcd so this should run

1013
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,680
and it should show you a hello world

1014
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,960
so in case

1015
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,000
you are not seeing it try this is

1016
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,800
something called

1017
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,400
this is a potentiometer this is the same

1018
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
device that we talked about that is

1019
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,680
inside a servo

1020
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,079
this is basically a a variable

1021
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,280
resistance

1022
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,000
which you can use um to signal that

1023
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,760
you're doing uh changing

1024
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,680
right something like a knob

1025
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,720
um any in case you're not seeing

1026
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,800
if if you don't see nothing in your in

1027
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,720
your in your

1028
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,520
in your lcd you just change this and and

1029
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,319
tune it

1030
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,040
because sometimes this is what this

1031
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,800
changes the contrast

1032
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,680
okay so maybe the program is running

1033
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,319
fine

1034
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,920
but you're not seeing anything maybe

1035
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,640
because of this so have that in mind

1036
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,240
also this part um as you can see this is

1037
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,119
a jumper

1038
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,280
but you can also use one of in case you

1039
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,119
actually didn't came with it

1040
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,720
you just you can use a female to female

1041
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,599
jumper

1042
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,720
cable that it came with your kit so you

1043
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,760
can put it right there

1044
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,599
but you can just use whatever you want

1045
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,680
to short circuit

1046
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,000
once you short circuit the back of the

1047
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,560
led is going to light up

1048
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,800
everything should work but if you don't

1049
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,880
have this led turn on it's going to

1050
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,520
you're not going to need some external

1051
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,720
light

1052
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,680
to to see it

1053
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,520
okay so this is the the program

1054
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,200
the cool program that we're gonna be

1055
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,640
using

1056
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,040
do you remember as we struggle in the

1057
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,680
first

1058
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,359
uh that in the first three

1059
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,319
um classes on getting the um

1060
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,400
the ip of the raspberry pi

1061
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,599
on our network so i made a program

1062
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,800
that imports right the lcd driver

1063
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,480
then imported the super process because

1064
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,839
we're going to be using some

1065
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,119
some some common line tools with this

1066
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,200
python program

1067
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,160
i did the same i declare this this

1068
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,280
function of the

1069
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,319
of the driver right

1070
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,119
then this is the command that we're

1071
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:11,760
gonna be

1072
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,280
sending to okay to the to the linux

1073
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,640
and this is if config this is the device

1074
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,720
that the raspberry pi is using i'm

1075
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,920
connected through my wi-fi

1076
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,880
uh with the up to my router through the

1077
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,520
wi-fi

1078
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,920
in the raspberry pi i'm going to look

1079
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,680
for this

1080
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,240
i'm going to take this column and that's

1081
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,880
going to be the ip

1082
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,800
then i'm going to run again as you can

1083
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,640
see this is not the same as before we

1084
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,839
just called in the last

1085
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,079
in the last uh program we're going to

1086
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,839
run this command which is this one

1087
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,960
which is this one we're going to put

1088
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,319
all of this condition also arguments

1089
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,680
and then the the result of that the

1090
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,760
result of that which is the std out

1091
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,280
which is another output

1092
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,560
it's going to be the ip address then

1093
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,920
we're going to send it again as a string

1094
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,240
and it should pop right into the screen

1095
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,560
of the of the lcd

1096
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,920
something that i didn't explain that i'm

1097
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,680
going to explain now is that

1098
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,280
this means the row

1099
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,400
that is going to show for example

1100
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,800
if you wanted to show in the row below

1101
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,160
as as you can see

1102
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,800
the lcd that you got it's called

1103
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,359
something

1104
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,720
it's called 16 by two so if you want to

1105
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,319
show in the first one you put one if

1106
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,079
you're gonna just do a second one you do

1107
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,400
here

1108
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,760
so if you want it and also

1109
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,359
the zero is where it starts

1110
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,880
so um

1111
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,319
if you want the hello world to be in the

1112
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,400
middle you can just put the number two

1113
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,240
or three and it's going to be right

1114
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,160
uh is going to be just you're going to

1115
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,680
justify by putting that

1116
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,680
if not just going to put it in the right

1117
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,280
in the last i'm sorry

1118
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,839
so here let me go to that program and

1119
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,480
open it up

1120
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,400
over here so as you can see it's the

1121
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,520
same program

1122
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,200
we're going to run it um as you can see

1123
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,240
it runs once and it doesn't have

1124
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:26,880
anything

1125
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,640
um no specific output

1126
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,280
because uh everything every up the

1127
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,880
output

1128
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,599
went directly to the to the to the lcd

1129
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,359
screen

1130
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,200
it's not running forever because we

1131
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,359
don't have the while true

1132
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,760
so in case we want this for example in

1133
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,280
case that the raspberry pi is going

1134
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,319
remote

1135
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,559
we can just put this part of the program

1136
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,079
in a while true

1137
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,960
for example like this

1138
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,720
take this part and

1139
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,839
when i do the tab it makes it inside

1140
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,359
and it tells the program

1141
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,280
to this part of the program to be inside

1142
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,559
of this

1143
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,839
um function because this is a while

1144
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,200
function

1145
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,240
so now it's going to be run forever and

1146
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,800
as i can see in my image screen is

1147
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,760
telling me that i have

1148
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,280
the ip198

1149
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,960
which we can see right here

1150
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,960
or let me show you what we were doing

1151
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,480
let me let me break down this comment

1152
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,880
for you

1153
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,480
this python program i mean this linux

1154
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,720
um

1155
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,640
a command so we if we run with

1156
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,440
a quick config and ifconfig it's going

1157
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,160
to give you

1158
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,880
everything every ip of each one of this

1159
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,359
so

1160
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,200
if we had connector for example if you

1161
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,440
have if you have connected

1162
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,480
the um

1163
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,839
the ethernet cable in your raspberry pi

1164
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,319
you should change this program to be

1165
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,599
instead of

1166
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,040
wlan zero to be e e t h

1167
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,599
zero and instead of i net you just

1168
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:18,880
change it to

1169
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,880
whatever i p i probably it's the same

1170
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,079
idea okay

1171
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,680
to whatever whenever your ep goes on

1172
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,800
so as you can see i just put um let me

1173
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,520
do this

1174
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,240
ifconfig wlan let me copy and paste it i

1175
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,839
could

1176
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,680
just do that so i'm only getting this

1177
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,599
one this

1178
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,960
i'm going to search

1179
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,760
for inet

1180
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,359
the reason i put a space inside of it

1181
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,359
it's because if not i'm going to get

1182
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,040
also the i need six which is

1183
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,559
uh the ipv5 ipv6 okay

1184
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,400
i don't want that one because i'm not

1185
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,480
using that one to connect through vnc so

1186
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,440
what i did just

1187
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,040
was a little hack which is i'm taking

1188
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:09,520
this

1189
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,640
space too okay

1190
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,200
so i made this so i'm only going to get

1191
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,759
this line

1192
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,520
so as we also saw we can use the ark

1193
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,359
command to pass

1194
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,000
to search or to give me as an output

1195
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,559
the second column which is the one i

1196
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:33,040
want

1197
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,800
if you don't know which one you want i

1198
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,559
suggest you if you ever doing something

1199
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,520
like this i should

1200
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,640
suggest you to do the the com the one

1201
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,880
liner

1202
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,520
in a command line test it and if it

1203
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,000
works

1204
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,240
then you know you can search it and and

1205
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,280
then you can put it inside

1206
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,640
your python program etc or on your

1207
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,720
contact too that's that's very important

1208
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,559
okay as you can see if i did one i was

1209
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,839
going to be past

1210
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,520
this argument or this result

1211
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,880
this column if i do

1212
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,559
three i'm going to get nesmas because as

1213
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:13,680
you can see

1214
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,960
one two three okay

1215
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,640
so what i choose was the second one

1216
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,000
to give me the ip that i have as a

1217
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,480
raspberry pi

1218
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,800
um so yeah that's basically

1219
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,400
that's basically what i did with this

1220
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,160
program

1221
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,400
um you can do

1222
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,400
more fun stuff with this as you can see

1223
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,440
you can you can just

1224
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,760
search for the weather and have it and

1225
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,040
have it pop it up

1226
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,160
pop it up uh every time you maybe don't

1227
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,359
want it while true

1228
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,440
maybe you just prune this program you

1229
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,440
put it back to normal right

1230
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,280
back to all everything back to normal

1231
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,359
oops

1232
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,800
and then you want to do a crown top

1233
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,200
right

1234
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,040
and then you go on top

1235
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,359
slice

1236
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,000
one and then we go over here

1237
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,400
and maybe you want to know your ip every

1238
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,480
time it boots

1239
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,280
that's fun right

1240
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:29,839
reboot at reboot python3

1241
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:34,880
home pi desktop

1242
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,839
lcd

1243
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,240
os dot pi so

1244
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,119
if i hyphen if i have my lcd connected

1245
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,640
every time it would so

1246
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,520
it boots up the raspberry pi should

1247
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,280
should give me the ip

1248
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,520
something to have in mind as we talked

1249
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,400
before

1250
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,800
um that you have to give it time for

1251
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,599
some for

1252
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,359
for the motor to be moved right you

1253
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,200
remember that

1254
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,799
sometimes um

1255
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,079
you just want uh do you need to

1256
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,440
wait for um

1257
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,640
for the raspberry pi to finish

1258
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,400
booty so

1259
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,400
there's a command called sleep which is

1260
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,400
going which is basically the same slip

1261
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,720
that you have in python

1262
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,480
as you can see it's it's the the common

1263
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,240
line just left for one second

1264
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,359
here for five so

1265
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:34,880
if you ever want to make sure that

1266
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,640
you're gonna get a

1267
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,319
for example the raspberry pi still is

1268
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,240
booting up and you don't have the

1269
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,879
um the ip address

1270
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,000
you just you just can do here like this

1271
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,040
the first command is going to be sleep

1272
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,839
30 seconds for example and then

1273
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,040
i don't remember if it was like this oh

1274
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,240
it was like this yeah

1275
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,680
so at reboot it's going to wait

1276
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,599
30 seconds and then it's going to run

1277
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,880
this program

1278
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,799
so that's what it's going to do it's

1279
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,400
going to let the

1280
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,119
operating system to finish booting up

1281
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,960
and then it's going to give you the ip

1282
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,520
address

1283
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,960
on your lcd screen

1284
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,759
okay

1285
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:36,160
okay okay so

1286
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,200
um that was everything for uh

1287
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,240
this class i hope you liked it

1288
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,839
i don't know if you guys have any

1289
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,079
questions or if you want me to test

1290
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,920
something here with you guys um

1291
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,599
i don't know if you want me to to make

1292
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,960
some program up

1293
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,079
or are we or what you are is if there's

1294
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:03,839
something you want to be explained again

1295
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,000
right now you can see the beauty of um

1296
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,599
the the raspberry pi how it goes with

1297
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,000
making uh interfaces between the real

1298
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,440
world and the

1299
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:24,480
and the end software
