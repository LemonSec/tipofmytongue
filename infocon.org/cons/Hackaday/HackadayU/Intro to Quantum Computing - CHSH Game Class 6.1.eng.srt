00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,440
hey everyone

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,080
welcome and welcome back for people who

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,599
have been following

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,960
this is our 14th session at hackaday

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,359
and also six sessions ago we started

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,000
doing more coding

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,039
for anyone who's joining for the first

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,480
time

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,760
you can find all the past materials

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
in the hackaday project

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,880
every sunday we do this class except

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,920
last week we were on vacation

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,600
every week we do 30 minutes to one hour

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,719
discussing a topic the classes are

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,520
recorded

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,039
and is also using my comics

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,840
every week i will post something new on

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,840
the projects

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,719
we're also using the microsoft q sharp

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,239
documentation

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,559
for our sample code for our conceptual

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,159
reading you can also feel free to use

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:08,640
that

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,400
for your own understanding um

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
we are also we have been using the

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,159
quantum patterns for coding which is a

28
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,600
very nice tool for

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,040
hands-on guide of a concept so you can

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,720
build up your

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,119
q-sharp skill using these tutorials

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,159
so for today we're going to go back

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,280
to look at the entanglement so we're

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,920
going to do

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,880
one more example that uses entanglement

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,520
in our

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,799
algorithm and to see how that is

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,159
helpful we have discussed previously

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,799
the basic concepts like superposition

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,280
and

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
interference and entanglement these

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,119
three things are the most important

43
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:53,759
concepts

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,719
for quantum computing we also discussed

45
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,320
teleportation and super dense coding

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,759
those are

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,880
both examples using entanglement in

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,239
algorithm and it helps you see how

49
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,840
we can use entanglement to

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,840
help do some tasks

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,800
and linear algebra is needed for quantum

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,840
computing but it's not very

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,920
difficult is linear so

54
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,360
it's not it's not gonna get that hard

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,480
and the q sharp is a very good high

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
level tool for you to get more

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,959
understanding and be able to eventually

58
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,120
build your own algorithm using this

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,000
quantum focus

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,280
language so let's

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,360
take a few step back just to revise

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,560
important things about entanglement

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,239
entanglement is a result of

64
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,720
superposition and superposition

65
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,000
is the fundamental reason why

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,040
quantum computing could work and

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,720
is also fundamental to how our universe

68
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,200
is

69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,519
being built it's fundamentally quantum

70
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,959
mechanical

71
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,239
so say you have two qubits you would be

72
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,159
able to have these four different

73
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,720
types of configurations so

74
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,080
just using these colors as zeros and

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,560
ones

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,519
so these could be two zeros these could

77
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,080
be two

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,440
ones and we also could have one zero

79
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,959
and one one and one uh

80
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,640
and the other way around and because

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,840
we can enable superposition in a quantum

82
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,599
system then we are able to put

83
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
any of these combinations in

84
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,879
superposition so we can

85
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,440
build these special states called bell

86
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,560
states

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,640
and actually in this case is not

88
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,239
necessary about states because

89
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,439
a and these amplitudes a d b c

90
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,000
can be arbitrary you can build a

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,519
situation that has

92
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,120
a first qubit in zero and second qubit

93
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,080
in zero

94
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,239
with the superposition that first qubit

95
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,640
is one and second qubit is one

96
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,439
or you can build a case that you have

97
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,680
first qubit is zero and second qubit is

98
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,400
one

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,959
with a superposition of first qubit

100
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,600
being one

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,798
and seconds q will be zero if you have

102
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,160
equal amplitudes

103
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,280
for these states then you can form a

104
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
special

105
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,600
state called bell state so bell state we

106
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,000
have

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,800
four options uh all four

108
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,720
methods all four configurations can be

109
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
a bell state and what's special about

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,560
them is that they have

111
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,680
equal amputees and which means they have

112
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
equal probability

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,320
of getting these states out and

114
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,080
entanglement means that

115
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,639
when you measure one of the qubits you

116
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,000
don't even have to measure your

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,199
second another qubit to know what it is

118
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,720
because of the the setup

119
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,840
for belt states so say if you are in a

120
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,400
state

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,560
like this one zero zero plus one one

122
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,840
um you can have

123
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
if you measure your first qubit with

124
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,360
zero then you know

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,080
there's no way that second qubit will be

126
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,479
one

127
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,080
because this state is what's

128
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,720
contributing to to it so you would know

129
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,479
that you would measure the second qubit

130
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:26,960
being

131
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,240
zero with the probability of one half

132
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,160
equally if your first cube is one you

133
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,919
would know your second cubit is one

134
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,800
so this is this is what entanglement is

135
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,280
you

136
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,919
know that your two qubits are correlated

137
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,280
the results are correlated

138
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
if people don't mind you should mute

139
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,479
yourselves

140
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,600
let me also check i can do that here too

141
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,639
yeah thank you so today we're going to

142
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,280
talk about

143
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,440
a trick a game called chsh game

144
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,479
this stands for two people's

145
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,919
initials those are four physicists

146
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,280
who came up with the schema and it was

147
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,479
part of a proof

148
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,919
of the uh bell belt theorem

149
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,160
so for anyone who is interested in the

150
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,000
history you should look it up on the

151
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,639
history of the development of this

152
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,800
chsh experiment

153
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
and it also is a way that they're trying

154
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,600
to

155
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,319
prove entanglement is not a

156
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,039
property that needs a local hidden

157
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,000
wearable

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,039
so because when people first discovered

159
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,080
entanglements or set it up there you

160
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,800
thought that

161
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,759
oh this is strange if i split two

162
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,960
integral qubits

163
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,000
i can measure one and know the other one

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,800
as if

165
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,880
there's some communication in between

166
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,479
these two qubits

167
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,039
and uh they thought that they might

168
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,960
there might be some hidden wearable that

169
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,160
they cannot see

170
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,720
and that's uh local and they can

171
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,000
determine a qubit that's infinite far

172
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,080
away

173
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,680
but then a lot of proof has shown that

174
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,080
is

175
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,360
actually entanglement is not relying on

176
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,240
hidden

177
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,759
variables local hidden variables so

178
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,440
it goes back to something very

179
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,800
fundamental

180
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,759
but it's also really fun to look at this

181
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,720
game

182
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,720
and the algorithm because is

183
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,960
showing this specific case that it could

184
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,160
be better than

185
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,720
a classical game strategy

186
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,120
so the setup looks like this alice and

187
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,360
bob they are playing this game

188
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
and the rule of the game is that they

189
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,720
will be separated

190
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,240
physically and they can't communicate

191
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,039
in any way but they have to kind of

192
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:05,759
guess

193
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,440
what what bits or

194
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
information or card they should show

195
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,319
they have a referee

196
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,919
who has two cards

197
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,599
the l he will show to alice and

198
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,120
m he will show to bob but he will not

199
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,000
be sharing m to alice so alice wouldn't

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
know what bob gets

201
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,839
so depends on the information on l

202
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,360
and m alice and bob can

203
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,200
give a guess and output their a and b

204
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,120
if l times m equals to

205
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,279
a control b then they can win the game

206
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,279
otherwise it is loss

207
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,120
so if you set up the truth table for

208
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,959
this you will have

209
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,240
0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 for

210
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,720
l and m and then you can you can

211
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,600
calculate

212
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,720
what l times m equals to

213
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,120
zero zero zero one so if uh a

214
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,200
ctrl b gives exactly this

215
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,240
or so each time they can do it through

216
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,000
this game many times so each time

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,320
they guess it correctly they will be

218
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,040
winning

219
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,480
so you will see that um actually

220
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,600
classically they can do say because

221
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,399
is more likely to get zero then they can

222
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,839
say

223
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,480
why don't we just always give out zeros

224
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,279
so like

225
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,800
in this case and we can at least get 70

226
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,320
chance of winning you can actually do

227
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,800
better

228
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,560
if you have a pair of qubits

229
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,560
and if this is allowed as a quantum game

230
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,880
you can actually improve that chance of

231
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,000
winning

232
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,839
so also you can also

233
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,519
understand that in order to get 0 001

234
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,880
your a and b has to be

235
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,920
0 0 1 1 for the case of 0 0 0

236
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,959
because you can calculate what a

237
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,839
control b would be so 0 control zero

238
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:18,800
will still be zero

239
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,519
one control one will flip this because

240
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,040
zero one is the

241
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,360
control bits and your big is the target

242
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,560
bits so it flips

243
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,440
to zero so these two cases will give you

244
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,839
these

245
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,279
three cases but then it gets harder when

246
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,279
your l m is both at once

247
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,120
so then alice has to have a zero

248
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,800
when bob has a one or alice has

249
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,240
one bob has a zero so that would make

250
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,040
a control b to be one so it's

251
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,079
basically for for them if they are doing

252
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,279
this classically

253
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,560
their strategy would be let's make it

254
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,839
70 chance of winning but

255
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,000
then if you can have a quantum strategy

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,120
you can win this more than 85 percent

257
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,800
of the time so let's say that

258
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,320
of course this would involve

259
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,000
entanglement

260
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,839
because you will have information that

261
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,320
is embedded in the entanglement initial

262
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,200
state

263
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,519
then you can have some correlation

264
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,240
between your

265
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,240
outputs say they have a pre

266
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,000
entangled qubit they entangle their two

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,120
qubits to this

268
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,600
state so this is arbitrary but just

269
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,160
without

270
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,399
loss of generality we can pick just this

271
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,760
one so we know

272
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,160
if we measure if alice measures a zero

273
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,000
bob would definitely measure a zero

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,600
if alice measures one bob will get a one

275
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,040
and this is very helpful before i show

276
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,079
you the next page

277
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,360
also i want to remind you that we had

278
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,720
in a couple of classes earlier that we

279
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,000
know that

280
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,320
measurement is also kind of relative

281
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,120
depending on what basis you use you can

282
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,240
get

283
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,680
results aligned to your bases

284
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,040
so this is very key for this game

285
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,920
which i will show next so just a

286
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,200
reminder

287
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,519
you could measure things in the basis of

288
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,639
0 and 1

289
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,760
and then your output would be some

290
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,320
probability of 0 and probability of 1.

291
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,200
but you could

292
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,240
also measure along a different

293
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,360
basis say you can measure

294
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,839
our quantum system in the plus and minus

295
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,880
basis

296
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,200
then your output will be aligned to

297
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,120
either plus or minus with the

298
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,639
probability

299
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,680
okay and

300
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,480
this is what alice and bob would use for

301
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:54,959
their

302
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,079
game for their strategy so the clever

303
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:58,639
thing

304
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,079
is that they are using both

305
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,200
the entanglement and the

306
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,680
fact that they can use different bases

307
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,639
to measure things

308
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,680
so before they start the game

309
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,120
they agree alice will measure

310
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,279
along the z axis which is our

311
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,639
the most used bases the normal

312
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,079
zero and one basis if

313
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,519
the referee gives l equals to zero

314
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,639
but alice would then measure along the

315
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,760
plus and minus spaces if the referee

316
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,320
gives

317
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,079
one the thing is that if alice measures

318
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:40,959
a zero

319
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,240
or a plus in either basis she would then

320
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,079
report a zero

321
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,680
if she measures minus all one

322
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,800
she will report a one then in bob's case

323
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,560
he would use this very weird a

324
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,839
different set of bases

325
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,959
they can be anywhere on this block

326
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,079
sphere

327
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,399
and earlier i have mentioned when i

328
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,720
introduced block sphere that

329
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,199
usually is not that useful unless you

330
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,000
just look at a single qubit

331
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,760
and turn out that is actually very

332
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
useful in this game

333
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,680
bob can use the block sphere and he can

334
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,800
choose these two particular

335
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,959
axes as his measurements basis

336
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,600
so the the pi over eight puts

337
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,959
this axis 45 degrees away from the z

338
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,639
axis so basically in the middle of

339
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,079
this two normal axis

340
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,160
that we typically would write out

341
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,800
and he has another option which is

342
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,160
perpendicular to

343
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,399
this pi over a is minus pi over eight

344
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
so they agreed if the

345
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,560
referee gives m equal to zero then

346
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
bubble would measure along this pi over

347
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,279
eight

348
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,279
basis but if referee gives

349
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,839
m equal to 1 he will measure along this

350
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,680
one instead

351
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,120
the interesting is that you can write

352
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,519
out

353
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,199
the exact state

354
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,639
based on the angle and you just

355
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,959
write out what this state would be in

356
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,639
terms of cosine

357
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,920
the angle and sine the angle and

358
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,320
these cosine and sine are the amplitudes

359
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,839
that you will get

360
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,160
you will can already see from this

361
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,240
visualization that

362
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,440
these two states are closer to the zero

363
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,000
over here and these two states are

364
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,079
closer to the one over here

365
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,839
so bob agrees that if he measures pi

366
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,639
array

367
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,160
or minus pi array in the m equal to one

368
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,120
case

369
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,000
then he would report b over b equal to

370
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,040
zero

371
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,880
if we measure these either these two

372
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,399
states based on what's

373
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,440
the referee asks

374
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,040
he would report be over one so this

375
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,279
actually this then can guarantee that

376
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,440
they have a really high likelihood of

377
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,720
getting this

378
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,240
table right because um

379
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,040
interesting so you already can see that

380
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,959
these two are closer to one these two

381
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:27,759
are closer to

382
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,199
zero so let's pick a place

383
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,079
on this table

384
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,800
you should try all of these cases but

385
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,600
let's pick

386
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,959
one like we know that this one is the

387
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,959
hardest to guess let's just pick this

388
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,000
one

389
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,800
so this case alice has l equal to one

390
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,040
so then she would measure along this

391
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,480
axis

392
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,720
and say she gets a plus and she reports

393
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,600
a equal to zero so then we know that

394
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,320
this one

395
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,000
is the one she reports we

396
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
bob has to get a one in order to win

397
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,599
this game how

398
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,720
how would that happen

399
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,199
we know that because their qubits are

400
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,119
entangled when alice measures a plus

401
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,159
bob will measure a um

402
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,000
pi uh so

403
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,440
bob will measure a pi over a

404
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,320
or minus pi over eight these two states

405
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,200
because

406
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,160
we know we're just changing the basis of

407
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,280
the measurement

408
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,480
if bob were measuring along the z axis

409
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,080
he will get a zero because alice got a

410
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,559
zero

411
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,039
say if alice got a goal of one

412
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,559
on her basis she would measure a minus

413
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,120
so then we know bob would definitely be

414
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,240
measuring either these states

415
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,480
so

416
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840
we know that we're looking at this case

417
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,520
so m equal to 1

418
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,960
in this case so bob is definitely going

419
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,799
to get

420
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,760
not definitely but has a really high

421
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,280
probability of getting

422
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,440
this state y because this amplitude

423
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,640
cos seven times pi over eight squared is

424
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,000
zero

425
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,240
how do we get uh how do we know this is

426
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,200
seven times

427
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,919
pi ray is base is the angle away from

428
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,320
the z

429
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,400
axis so it's one two three four five six

430
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,880
seven of them and that's why

431
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,919
along these special states they are

432
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,360
45 degrees so they have these symmetry

433
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,640
here

434
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,799
and you're maximizing bob's chance of

435
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,840
getting a zero out out

436
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,799
so um

437
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,559
yeah i think i i might have made a

438
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,200
mistake

439
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,400
uh in my talking here so bob has to get

440
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,960
a

441
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,200
get a one out so sorry he has to go

442
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,559
on this state so oh sorry

443
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,000
on this state so yeah okay sorry

444
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,160
so it's actually sine 3 times pi over 8

445
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,039
squared that is 80

446
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,559
so

447
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,679
if alice measures a one then

448
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,080
is this case here and bob needs to get a

449
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,639
zero out

450
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,918
and then

451
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,480
is along this axis

452
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,919
so bob will get this date

453
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,039
and this is when he will report

454
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,200
b equals to zero to uh to help

455
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
understand this a bit more let's just

456
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,520
take a look at the code

457
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,799
so i can i i probably just pick the

458
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,640
hardest case to show you right now

459
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,520
so it might be a little hard for people

460
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,000
to see

461
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,039
it right away let's try

462
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,600
uh look at this simple case and then we

463
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,840
we're going to look at the code

464
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,039
so say okay let alice use this

465
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,240
normal that axis so l

466
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
when l equals to one case she's gonna

467
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,080
measure either zero and one

468
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,000
along this one so

469
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,360
let's pick this case when bob measures

470
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,840
a zero so he's going to measure along

471
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,960
this one

472
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,520
we know that when alice measures a 0 bob

473
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,400
will measure

474
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,679
a pi over 8 instead of the

475
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,200
this opposite one so on this one here

476
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,720
the zero state has 85 percent of chance

477
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,600
and this is something like 14 so he's

478
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,080
more

479
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,799
going to be more likely to get zero and

480
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,080
that's what he's gonna output

481
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,440
so this is a setup so basically you

482
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,320
have this table and you're putting your

483
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,799
qubits in this position

484
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,000
where is maximizing the chance

485
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,280
of getting the correct answer and the

486
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,520
chance is based on the amplitudes of

487
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,320
these cosine

488
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,159
and sine in front of them you guarantee

489
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,760
that

490
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,120
when either case

491
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,280
you have a higher probability of getting

492
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,440
0 for this upper case

493
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,600
and higher probability of getting one in

494
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
the lower case

495
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,720
so let's take a look at the code

496
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,960
that hopefully helps too the

497
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
q sharp exercise we're going to use

498
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,240
today

499
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,360
is on the qdk sample code

500
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,440
we're not going to do the cutouts but we

501
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,240
do have a chsh game so that i will leave

502
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,280
it to you as

503
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,039
a as a piece of homework

504
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,840
let's look at the sample code and this

505
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,240
is also

506
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,360
i want to show you some other places you

507
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,760
should

508
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,000
look up for more additional tutorials

509
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,840
on the microsoft docs website

510
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,640
docs.microsoft.com

511
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,280
quantum you'll be able to find all of

512
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,559
the documentation

513
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,919
about q sharp and qdk and a lot of

514
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,360
tutorials

515
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,480
and here in the q sharp code

516
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,799
i don't know if people can see this i

517
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,679
can try to

518
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,919
expand it but on your own teams you can

519
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,280
also do control plus

520
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,600
or the equivalent on mac to zoom in

521
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,120
so you can find on this sample

522
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,679
page this validating quantum mechanics

523
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,440
with the chsh game

524
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,000
so nicely you can download it or you can

525
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,039
go to the

526
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,799
browser it's on github so you can

527
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,000
download the code there depending on the

528
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,320
ide that you use we have many options

529
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,559
you can run it on visual studio code

530
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,600
and using python or use c

531
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,640
sharp so in my case i like

532
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,919
using the

533
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,240
visual studio code and

534
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,720
yeah you can use it in in jupyter

535
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,440
notebook or whatever id you want

536
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,799
so this is this is the sample code

537
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,440
and it also gives you a nice history

538
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,559
some

539
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,679
reading to do beforehand

540
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,480
so we're just gonna look at how this is

541
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,080
set up

542
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,919
is actually quite simple so

543
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,960
here it wants you to

544
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,080
measure the alice's cube

545
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,600
so alice is going to measure her

546
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,200
qubit in her basis

547
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,159
so that's how you can set up so measure

548
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:10,480
is

549
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,520
m reset is resetting or qubit back

550
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,720
to zero so this is kind of like

551
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,279
a just initialization step every time

552
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,559
you finish you can

553
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,600
reset your qubits

554
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,200
but here reset is resetting to

555
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,440
let's look at the z case because this is

556
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,520
normal case so

557
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,919
it's called computational basis don't

558
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,760
don't get

559
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,679
stopped by this jargon here but it

560
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,279
really just means it is

561
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,559
this axis here so

562
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,720
it's just doing a measurement and then

563
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
you can reset it back

564
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,279
along this axis and if you want to do a

565
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,400
measurement

566
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,000
you and reset on the on the

567
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,360
plus and minus axis is this one in this

568
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,360
case they call it x because this is a

569
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,240
long

570
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,440
a line along the x and they call it

571
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,919
sine basis because plus and minus are

572
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,799
signs i think that's why

573
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,840
and in bob's case then it's very similar

574
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,080
you can set it up oops

575
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,559
into zooming in bob's case

576
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,640
you can set it up very similarly but in

577
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,400
this case you have to rotate

578
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,960
your positions on the block sphere so

579
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,640
remember we talked about the ry

580
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,760
rotation matrix is

581
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,559
for any arbitrary point on the block

582
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,679
sphere you can

583
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,840
change the angles and here we're just

584
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,520
trying to change theta

585
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,600
and we're trying to put it to the 45

586
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,640
degrees

587
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,520
and we see that theta over 2 is the

588
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,679
angle that you want to get

589
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,960
so you have to time it by by 2 pi over

590
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,320
8 because pi over a itself is 22.5

591
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,760
so you time it by 2 to get 45.

592
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,960
so this is doing exactly like what

593
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,799
alice did but just using the ry matrix

594
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,559
to get to where you want

595
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,360
if you want to measure along the pi over

596
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,840
eight basis

597
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,200
then you will get zero then

598
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,360
this is the basis that you're going to

599
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,880
measure

600
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,720
so then if you want to measure

601
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,640
along the minus pi over eight you're

602
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,679
going to do a rotation

603
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,799
to this point here

604
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,360
so then afterwards you can reset it back

605
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,880
to normal

606
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,080
but it's not necessary

607
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,720
now i think so then

608
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,799
just after you put together the

609
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,840
operation you set up the strategy

610
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,039
and these

611
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,000
are operation measure bob qubit measure

612
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,279
alice bob qubit which

613
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,640
you use at the end here before that you

614
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,240
need to entangle their qubits

615
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,520
we use a h and c naught so that's it

616
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,480
that's that's how you set up this nice

617
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:10,880
uh

618
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,480
algorithm to achieve this

619
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,600
output so this what this

620
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,840
code does is calculating your

621
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,120
probability so you don't actually you

622
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,679
don't

623
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,480
quite see the output but is telling you

624
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
the probability of

625
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,240
running this algorithm so on

626
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,440
the visual studio code i use

627
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,799
we use dotnet run

628
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:49,840
okay don't worry about the warning

629
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,120
yep so it says classically we get

630
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,799
about 75 and quantum

631
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,799
is 85 so quantum success rate exceeds

632
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:01,600
classical

633
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,640
successory but then i also wondered is

634
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,399
this like

635
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,840
we do we have have to put on these two

636
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,399
particular axes can we change the angle

637
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,919
a little bit

638
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,799
so you could i think there are some

639
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,880
other angles you can still

640
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,919
get high probability to get zero and one

641
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,640
um i think if i put it a little bit off

642
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,559
it's still going to be

643
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,240
very similar output because you are

644
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,760
putting the more likelihood

645
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,039
in these angles so cosine pi over 9 is

646
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,880
not so different from cosine pi

647
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,000
over 8. but if you do

648
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,960
a really big angle if you change it all

649
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,760
the way

650
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,120
down here then it becomes ambiguous

651
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,279
so if you can if you want to put a

652
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,320
really

653
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,520
large angle then these numbers gonna

654
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,880
change

655
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,000
so try this out at home yourself

656
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,200
like i'm just exaggerating here

657
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,520
so

658
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,159
so yeah all you get for the amplitude

659
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,480
for the probability is from the

660
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,760
amplitude depending on

661
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
where you set as your amplitude you

662
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,120
would get different probabilities

663
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,159
yeah i need to save yeah so

664
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,039
the pi over 9 cases are still like

665
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,480
pretty high

666
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,279
oh i'm sorry

667
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,760
yeah so that's that's it that's pretty

668
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,039
neat little algorithm

669
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,159
is a nice trick that that

670
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,480
demonstrates both the entanglement and

671
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,440
the use of

672
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,760
measurements and that's very useful for

673
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,880
our understanding later on when we

674
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,440
we we had a class around gruever's

675
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,720
algorithm

676
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,360
and this helps with the thinking that

677
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,440
you could do measurements

678
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,159
on the block sphere anywhere really that

679
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,799
you can just choose arbitrary

680
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,000
basis to do your measurement and

681
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
in google's algorithm you have you have

682
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,120
like the

683
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,600
amplification of amplitudes using

684
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,679
um a change of basis so

685
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,559
we had a class on that uh we're going to

686
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,120
do

687
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,640
more coding exercise on google's later

688
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,000
yeah so like in the pi over 50 case

689
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,120
um yeah it's still higher a little bit

690
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,720
but it's very similar so the

691
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,840
um the probability dropped a little bit

692
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,200
uh so for further reading further

693
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,159
learning i

694
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,960
came across this nice recording by

695
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,640
professor ryan or

696
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,360
donor his class on chsh game so it's

697
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,559
about an hour long you can feel free to

698
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,919
watch it but i think

699
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,880
the beginning so the setup is the same

700
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,279
but

701
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,679
he's using not the block sphere but the

702
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,399
um

703
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,679
collapsed to the uh

704
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,120
circle so it's a different

705
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,559
representation but it's the same

706
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,960
telling the same story um but i think

707
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,600
what's

708
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,039
interesting in this lecture is later

709
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,240
he also gives several different schema

710
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,960
for

711
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,880
classical strategy so he showed that

712
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,720
you you can have many different types of

713
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,159
classical strategies but

714
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,159
then still you cannot exceed 75

715
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,559
so the best case scenario for classical

716
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,240
is 75

717
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,000
but the uh quantum boosted up

718
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,240
to 85 so that's interesting to

719
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,519
see before we finish

720
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,960
off uh i mentioned the no cloning

721
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,000
theorem

722
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,200
and i just want to quickly show this uh

723
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,159
that is so simple the proof is so simple

724
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,679
i don't even have to draw

725
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,480
a cartoon to explain it so we can look

726
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,039
at this

727
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,080
step by step so no clean learning

728
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,880
theorem is saying that we cannot copy

729
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,200
a qubit so

730
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,679
that's why we have to do we can do

731
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,519
things like teleportation we can

732
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,000
entangle

733
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,559
them we can infer measurement results

734
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,919
but we cannot

735
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,039
create an exact copy of an

736
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,799
arbitrary state so if you had one

737
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,840
that would be something like an

738
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,080
operation

739
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,880
so in this case you can call you have a

740
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,679
function called

741
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,799
copy and if you have arbitrary

742
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,000
state phi with zero

743
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,640
or about the tensor here is just showing

744
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,360
that it's

745
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,320
putting these two qubits together no

746
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,279
entanglements happening here

747
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,720
and if you can make the zero into five

748
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,159
then you will get

749
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,519
this case out so you can

750
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,720
first try to expand the right hand side

751
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,279
the phi will have an arbitrary amplitude

752
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,399
for zero and one alpha and beta

753
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,679
and the uh the other one also then you

754
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,000
expand it you'll get these different

755
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,279
four terms but then if you expand the

756
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,320
left hand side

757
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,840
you would zero is still zero but

758
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,960
of the phi is alpha zero and

759
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,559
beta one you will get this this out so

760
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,760
then if you compare

761
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,000
these two they are contradicting so that

762
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,200
means you can't

763
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,480
really have a function called copy to

764
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,320
produce something like this is in a way

765
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,760
um assuming that we know that in

766
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,440
quantum operations the gates are all our

767
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,480
unitary

768
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,240
so this is showing that you can't find

769
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,320
a unitary operation that

770
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,760
produce a copy but this doesn't take

771
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,560
into account

772
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,839
measurement so this proof

773
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,199
is in a way not complete but quite

774
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,839
intuitive

775
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:23,040
you could have a more complete

776
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,280
proof that includes measurements which

777
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,199
means that you would just look at

778
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,359
each qubit you would

779
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,760
not just use the amplitude but you also

780
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,079
look at and do measurement and look at

781
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,440
the states but that

782
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,560
also shows that we can't it's impossible

783
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:42,960
to

784
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,159
have such way to

785
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,879
either use a gauge or do a measurement

786
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:49,839
to get

787
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,960
a copy out it looks

788
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,800
simple the math is just very

789
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,560
straightforward but

790
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,920
it is a fundamental rule in quantum

791
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,160
computing or in quantum mechanics

792
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,320
is because it's fundamental because

793
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,040
we know any arbitrary state in quantum

794
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,640
computing can be written in this way

795
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,440
because

796
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,480
our states are linear if you want to

797
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,760
make a copy you will get

798
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,560
nonlinear results and that's not

799
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,079
possible

800
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,920
so our it means it shows that our

801
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,960
universe is

802
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,520
governed in a linear way and we can't

803
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,200
copy information

804
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,240
this way and also you we cannot really

805
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,280
delete

806
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,560
information so this is uh no cloning

807
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,920
theorem

808
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,640
that's all we are showing discussing

809
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,200
today

810
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,720
so before we go off a reminder on july

811
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,480
16th we have the actual quantum

812
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,079
developer workshop

813
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,240
sign up this is an opportunity for you

814
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,079
to learn more about

815
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,880
how do you can now use quantum computing

816
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,119
to solve our problems

817
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,839
we'll talk about

818
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,839
case studies and

819
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,440
microsoft developing this cloud-based

820
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,720
platform for people to write

821
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,880
programs in q sharp and be able to

822
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,560
access

823
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,640
hardware quantum hardware through the

824
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,760
cloud

825
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,280
and i'm giving a talk on learning

826
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,119
quantum and with a lot of other

827
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,400
colleagues and we have virtual labs to

828
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,040
show

829
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,079
and have you work on some problems

830
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,960
hands-on so this is definitely

831
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,160
information

832
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,800
packed event you should take advantage

833
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,160
of is all free so

register and tune in on thursday

835
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,560
any questions you can post in the chat

836
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,200
right now i'm staying on for a couple

837
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,480
minutes longer

838
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,280
and for any question that comes up feel

839
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,680
