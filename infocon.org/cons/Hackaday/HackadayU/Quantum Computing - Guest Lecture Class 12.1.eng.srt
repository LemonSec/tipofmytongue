[Music]

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,880
okay

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,679
thank you everyone for joining we have a

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,519
big audience today

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,800
and this is our 21st 20 yeah

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
21st session now and uh starting from

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,359
today

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,600
september and october we're gonna have

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,720
some guest lectures

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,840
and i just remind everyone in case

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,519
there's any newcomers

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,880
also past attendees

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,320
you should know that everything

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,079
all the materials that we use can be

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,239
found through the hackaday project

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,360
quantum computing for comics we spent

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,960
30 minutes to an hour on topic

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
and we used quantum computing

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,039
documentation from microsoft

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,760
and the cutoffs as our exercises so if

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,480
you visit

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,640
previous classes the recordings are all

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,600
up on

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,239
hackaday you should be able to also

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,959
follow some coding exercises

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,600
as i mentioned starting from today we're

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,400
gonna have

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,439
a series of very interesting topics

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,720
from our guest lecturers so today we

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,200
have

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,640
professor taro franz uh talking about

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,280
quantum

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
cryptography and later on we'll have

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,240
quantum tomography quant q sharp

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,360
community project

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,079
q trill uh quantum machine learning

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,000
quantum error correction all these great

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,200
topics

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,000
so you have been coming to the class uh

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,759
it's been

41
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,799
i have taught 20 classes and

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,200
if you follow most of it you will be

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
able to have

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,759
a background needed for the specific

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,560
topics

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,720
and it would help that you took those

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,920
classes

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,320
because these are all very specific

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,200
topics

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,560
that you would need the fundamentals

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,680
for so we're very much looking forward

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,799
to all the guests

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,960
we have a really great lineup here

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,479
so today we have professor franz

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,120
he's a professor at harrisburg

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,000
university of science and technology

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,959
and he also hosts several meetups

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,560
including the philadelphia

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,120
harrisburg quantum computing media group

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,599
and

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,400
the quantum appaloosa that he manages

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,720
he's been coming to the class and it has

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,239
been a great support of

64
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,280
quantum computing education

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,239
so today he will be talking about

66
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,160
quantum cryptography

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
and uh talk about quantum key

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,319
distribution

69
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,599
and we'll see some examples of

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
how alice can send information to bob

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
without being

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,120
eavesdropped so we did

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,239
do two classes on shorts algorithms

74
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,840
so if you have taken those this today's

75
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,319
class

76
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,480
will also have some relations to that

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,640
um yeah a side note is that uh

78
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,680
people have been asking about the comics

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,959
that i've been drawing so

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,400
actually i just made that available huh

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
so you can buy it now

82
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,560
it's on amazon i have this proof copy

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,680
here

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,879
so it's all printed out is you can use

85
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,239
it as a companion book

86
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,360
for this class so you can watch the

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,000
video

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,159
and look at the comics there and take

89
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,680
notes on the other side

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,560
so this is uh my proof copy and next

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
week i will have my

92
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,799
author's copy that's like

93
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
uh what you will see on the shelf

94
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,680
so yeah this is the on amazon you can

95
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,799
find it now

96
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,720
in your respective amazon stores

97
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,280
and i will post the code in the chat

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,000
later

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,319
so all of the information including

100
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,280
today's

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,319
talk will be recorded and uploaded

102
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,760
on youtube pretty much right away after

103
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,400
the class

104
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,480
so if you miss anything you can always

105
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,599
go back there

106
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,400
hackadays also started uploading all

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,360
these

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,560
um classes so

109
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,720
with a little bit of edit so if you you

110
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,600
can also

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,120
check out their playlist and yeah and

112
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,320
we're hoping to

113
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,320
do some q a and i will also be doing the

114
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,880
drawing as professor franz

115
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,159
gives the talk so

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,280
so i i can't guarantee that it will be

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,000
in the state

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,440
of publishing today but

119
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
i will use it as a note and i hope the

120
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,520
class here are also taking note

121
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,919
so drawing is my way of taking notes

122
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,280
that's what i'm gonna do

123
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
and i can show people at the end of the

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
class how that looks

125
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,199
and then yeah next week we will have

126
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,639
professor chris

127
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,080
ferry talking about quantum tomography

128
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,280
and we have q sharp community member

129
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,160
ralph coming the week after so take a

130
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,720
note

131
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,199
at the time change next week but then

132
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,960
the week after we are back on normal

133
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,000
time

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,479
that's it so let's welcome professor

135
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,280
franz

136
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,240
thank you for joining us thank you kitty

137
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,199
for

138
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,000
allowing me to not only get off of mute

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,120
but also

140
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,720
grab control of the screen it's an honor

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,360
and i'm i'm shocked you remember the

142
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,039
comment from like a week or two ago

143
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,000
about

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,639
you doing some live drawings i think i

145
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,840
don't think anybody would be paying

146
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,639
attention to me

147
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,039
now no i wasn't excited

148
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,320
oh i was hoping you had the cam on your

149
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,360
on your pencil or whatever

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,479
last thing before i get started here is

151
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,680
uh

152
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,440
my daughter started a new job and i'm

153
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,280
looking for some wardrobe or something

154
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,360
nice to get her do you have any ideas of

155
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,919
some

156
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,120
nice wardrobe i could get my daughter

157
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,400
for her new job

158
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,520
present are you asking this to let me

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,759
talk about my fashion brand

160
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,639
oh i didn't think of that yeah tell us

161
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,800
about your fashion brand please

162
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,800
uh it's called art by physicist

163
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,639
letting people know that this this is

164
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
not set up i am surprised that

165
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
professor frost is asking about it

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,919
but yeah if anyone's interested you can

167
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
search uh kiriyan.com and

168
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,479
that will pop up you'll see some

169
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,360
interesting

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,800
science inspired designs and wearable

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,120
technologies

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,080
i'm waiting to see someone walk down new

173
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,000
york times square wearing one of those

174
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,880
yes you have your daughter wear it

175
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,800
she's in philadelphia but that's close

176
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,479
enough well she goes up to new york a

177
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,440
lot so

178
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,360
anyway okay so i'm going to try to s

179
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,120
uh open the share

180
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,080
thingamajiggy and i think you can see

181
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,759
a screen with quantum cryptography

182
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,199
written on it yep

183
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,880
yep all right so i'm going to be moving

184
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,000
around here

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,639
uh different different modalities so

186
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
if anything gets weird let me know

187
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,639
already i lost something oh there it is

188
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,080
all right so

189
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,440
uh what i'm going to try to do is first

190
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,800
of all i i'm a

191
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,039
i've been in working with classical

192
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,560
computers for

193
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,319
46 years to tell you the truth um

194
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,440
and about 18 months 20 months ago i

195
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
shore's algorithm found me when i was

196
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,800
working in the

197
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
cyber security space and i haven't

198
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,680
looked back since

199
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,240
quantum is an exciting field uh

200
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,160
classical computing gets kind of

201
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
dull after a while believe it or not but

202
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,120
anyway over those years i basically

203
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,400
came up with you know the model of

204
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,280
uh you know computers everybody thinks

205
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,800
that computer technology is really

206
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,479
really difficult

207
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,080
and you know it really is not uh what it

208
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,240
is it's a whole lot of little

209
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,919
ideas tiny ideas actually in some cases

210
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,759
piled on top of each other so it looks

211
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,080
like it's really complicated and

212
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,680
that's where it gets complex it's

213
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,880
because it's a whole bunch of little

214
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,679
ideas

215
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,919
but if you take each idea and just look

216
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,200
at it for what it

217
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,479
for what it is uh bit by bit

218
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,519
over time uh you'll start to

219
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,200
understand the big picture and i think

220
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,360
quantum is the same thing

221
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,440
so here i'm going to talk about quantum

222
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,200
cryptography and it's really

223
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,320
following up on on

224
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,040
page or slide or illustration number 41

225
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,200
which goes back to i think sessions 17

226
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,480
and 18 when

227
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
when kitty was talking about rsa

228
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
encryption

229
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,480
which which then led to uh uh shore's

230
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,839
algorithm and such

231
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,080
so what i'd like to do though uh one of

232
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,480
the things that happens in quantum

233
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,399
because there's so much here there's a

234
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,839
lot of hand waiting

235
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,200
uh going on i mean uh you know

236
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,880
we we've only got a few minutes each

237
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
sunday uh to cover a topic and

238
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
and you know kitty sometimes does a deep

239
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
dive uh

240
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,920
and then sometimes stays high level so

241
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,200
uh what i'd like to do is is uh really

242
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
kind of mix it up a little bit and

243
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,120
here's another she gave an example

244
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,800
etc of the rsa but i'll mix it up a

245
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,760
little high level

246
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,480
a little low level and hopefully it it

247
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,760
it floats your boat because we have

248
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,240
quite a

249
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,279
we've got a mixed crowd here uh so first

250
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,560
of all uh when it comes to

251
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,560
exchanging information in secret

252
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,000
uh it's i think of it as a five uh

253
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,800
step process first of all you between

254
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,079
two parties you need to have an

255
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:08,959
agreement of

256
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,440
as to what your secrets are going to be

257
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,120
what your protocol is going to be how

258
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,640
are you going to communicate

259
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,839
and how are you going to communicate in

260
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,320
secret

261
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,959
then there's a next step because there's

262
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,120
lots of ways that we can communicate in

263
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,920
secret

264
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
from caesar's ciphers as i think

265
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,959
kitty may have mentioned which goes back

266
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,959
hundreds of years

267
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,680
to things being developed today in nist

268
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,000
is

269
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,120
working on post-quantum cryptography

270
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,760
so there's quite a a variety of of

271
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,680
techniques for

272
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,880
for uh sharing information in secret

273
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,600
between

274
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,640
two and sometimes more parties the

275
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,920
second thing is once you get an

276
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,480
agreement

277
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,920
generally and this is a still

278
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
generalization is uh

279
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,839
the parties need to develop some sort of

280
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,040
key some sort of secret

281
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,680
secret uh compass or what have you some

282
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,399
sort of

283
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,279
secret between them and then once that

284
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,600
those keys are generated uh

285
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,000
uh they need to be distributed uh they

286
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,040
need to be

287
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,360
sent from alice to bob and bob to alice

288
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,880
and so on

289
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
and then you have the steps of

290
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,880
encryption and decryption

291
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,320
and let me just bring this home a little

292
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,040
bit most of you probably don't realize

293
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,079
that

294
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,640
when you go to a website nowadays i

295
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,560
think it's like 70 plus percent of

296
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,440
websites

297
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,040
now use https it's up there

298
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,560
i guess you'll normally see it as a

299
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,800
little lock up on your browser

300
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,000
uh up near the url

301
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,680
and that's that is http with a

302
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,040
uh uh security protocol agreed security

303
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,320
protocol called

304
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440
ssl tls and

305
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,560
this is really uh this is the

306
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,800
when you first when you first reach a

307
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,920
website

308
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,680
uh there's this handshaking process

309
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,279
going on and it goes on very very

310
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,720
quickly thank goodness

311
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,440
and you don't even realize it but your

312
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,160
your

313
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,519
laptop uh sends a hello message to this

314
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
to the website uh and with that hello

315
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,920
message your laptops

316
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,880
gives a list of protocols that your

317
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,440
laptop

318
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,800
is prepared to use uh for secret

319
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,000
uh information exchange

320
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,880
and the website on the other side on the

321
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,079
server side

322
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,600
takes a look at the list that your

323
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
client can communicate

324
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,560
with and selects uh

325
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,320
one of those protocols and then sends

326
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,519
back the

327
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,040
okay here's the deal this is the

328
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
protocol we'll use

329
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,959
and that's over here and then this part

330
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,720
here

331
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
and so there's this dialogue that goes

332
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,839
on very quickly

333
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,839
and because there's a whole bunch of

334
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,760
different ways

335
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,440
to to encrypt your data and uh

336
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,320
keep it secret and so this happens very

337
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,519
very quickly

338
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,320
every time you go to effectively a new

339
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,600
web page

340
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
another bit of background is

341
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,440
cryptography

342
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,440
has two

343
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,600
basic food groups if you will one is

344
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,720
where

345
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,200
you have a symmetric key where alice and

346
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,320
bob

347
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,720
basically use the same key and then

348
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,760
there's uh

349
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,519
asymmetric which is where there's a

350
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,959
different key

351
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,319
for uh the encryption and decryption etc

352
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,560
and uh so

353
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,000
typically caesar back in the day

354
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,639
uh used what's called the caesar cipher

355
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,680
and that's where

356
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,720
uh they just shifted uh characters in

357
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,120
the alphabet so if you had uh

358
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,800
abc they would uh shift it by let's say

359
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,160
uh three or four uh letters and

360
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,279
abc would be come out as x y z

361
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,440
etc i think you're most of you are

362
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,399
fairly

363
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,680
familiar with that so

364
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
let me get to a little bit of detail

365
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,760
here step back a bit

366
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,600
and i'll pull out the magic white board

367
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,800
because

368
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,399
i want to compete with i want to compete

369
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,399
with uh kitty on some drawings here so

370
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,160
i'm going to try

371
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,440
um so

372
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,600
let's get down into the real

373
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,839
nitty-gritty of what goes on so what if

374
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,360
i wanted to send

375
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,480
the message the word comic

376
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,000
from alice to bob

377
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,600
well let's remove some of that magic

378
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,079
first of all we don't really send

379
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,199
characters ceo and all that

380
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,399
and i don't like to take shortcuts

381
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,160
when doing stuff like this so i'm going

382
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,680
to show you exactly what i do

383
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,000
even looking up the websites

384
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,360
so what the word comic

385
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,040
really looks like i'll stick this over

386
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,279
here

387
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,120
it's over here

388
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,839
when we send it through the internet

389
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,880
it's like the three planet problem here

390
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,000
i got three things going on

391
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,199
there we go alright so

392
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,399
and we'll say that that's a little c

393
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,360
lowercase c so over here

394
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,199
this is x this is really what gets

395
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,880
transferred over the internet

396
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,279
we call it data and data in

397
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,440
in transit so so the c becomes one

398
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,639
or zero one one zero

399
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,399
uh zero zero one 1 and that's a c

400
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,839
and the o i'll look up an o

401
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,639
becomes a

402
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,279
zero one one zero

403
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,920
oh that's convenient one one one one

404
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,519
all right so that's really the first

405
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,959
abstraction a lot of people

406
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,040
think that the letter c and o actually

407
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
go through the airwaves and

408
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,639
no that's not that's not exactly right

409
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,000
it's a series of

410
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,800
of zeros and ones ons and off bits and

411
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,759
bytes

412
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,120
three volts and five volts etc

413
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,320
so this is and i'll just use c and o but

414
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,399
i'll just boil it down to just use c

415
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,440
because i don't want to be

416
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,000
drawing all day so if i wanted to send

417
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,800
it a c

418
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,279
from alice to bob this is what would get

419
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,640
sent

420
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,359
0 1 0 0

421
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,000
now clearly if i sent that

422
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,439
through the internet

423
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,679
eve would be able to decipher that she

424
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,799
would be able to say

425
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,880
oh well that's a c because i can just

426
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,039
look it up in this table

427
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,319
so what if i put a what if i took this

428
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,840
code here

429
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
and

430
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,400
put a key against it i processed it with

431
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,160
a key

432
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,760
and therefore

433
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,559
uh let me see

434
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,799
what would actually be sent over the

435
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,720
wires would be this

436
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,960
0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1.

437
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,960
and if i look this up over here

438
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,039
0 1 1 0 1 1

439
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,880
0 1 it would be a small

440
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,039
m

441
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,000
so now the cool thing is if i take this

442
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,640
same key

443
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,559
this guy up here

444
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,080
and did the same process it on again

445
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,840
and i'll explain the process in a second

446
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,520
when i decrypt

447
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,960
decrypt with the same key

448
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,559
then i get the c again so

449
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,360
back over here

450
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,760
and it's this guy right here so

451
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,320
what what algorithm what what rules did

452
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,280
i use here

453
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,919
and this is just an example i used

454
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:22,840
what's called

455
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,879
xor exclusive or

456
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,919
an xor is where if you have a

457
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:39,840
if you have two inputs

458
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,799
uh if so

459
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,480
the result would be as a one if there is

460
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,480
only one one in a or b

461
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,760
so if i had a if i had zero and zero

462
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,200
the result in an exclusive or would be a

463
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,799
zero

464
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,559
if i had a one and a zero with exclusive

465
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,360
or

466
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,880
i would have one which means that

467
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,640
there's only one one

468
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,280
if it was zero and one i would end up

469
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,240
with a one

470
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,280
if it was one and one what would you get

471
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,320
the result would be zero because the

472
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:32,720
rule

473
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,360
is if there's only one

474
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,080
uh one in the pair then it's the result

475
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,200
is a one

476
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,919
if there's no ones in the pair the

477
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,760
result is a zero and if there's

478
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,159
both of them are one then it's a zero so

479
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,000
what i basically did was

480
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,120
use xor here

481
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,280
but so the key here is you can see

482
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,799
hopefully at the my new detail

483
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,000
of how i can

484
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,919
take it in this case just a single

485
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,520
character c

486
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,360
apply a key to it with some cryptography

487
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,640
i can get a different character from

488
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,720
that

489
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,960
m in this case and i use the same key

490
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,039
this is identical here with the same

491
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,480
rule

492
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,960
again then i get the original

493
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,840
uh message all right now that's

494
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,280
it's that's as simple as it gets

495
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,720
and that's all that's really going on

496
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,600
so the key here is this guy right here

497
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,120
right literally the key

498
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,479
so if i just look at the key

499
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,400
and it doesn't matter what i have now

500
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,760
because i'm not going to i'll get away

501
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,720
from that

502
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,159
example 0 0

503
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,039
0 0. one one one zero

504
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,679
and i could give any key here and do

505
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,120
this process and it will work

506
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,720
uh so

507
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,559
in quantum cryptography

508
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,799
one of the primary use cases

509
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,440
of um quantum

510
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,720
mechanics and all the quantum

511
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,919
features is

512
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,240
sharing this key between alice and bob

513
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,320
because remember one of the steps is

514
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,360
the key distribution and that's really

515
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,880
one of the main

516
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,159
uh use cases for uh quantum

517
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,080
and so how does alice and bob

518
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,840
uh how can they share this key

519
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,520
well in quantum

520
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,559
we have a real important feature called

521
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,520
the no cloning

522
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,840
i guess it's a theorem

523
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,679
uh where uh we're going to take

524
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,720
advantage of that

525
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,080
and this means you basically can't copy

526
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,840
uh information so if if alice is here

527
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,240
and bob is here and eve is here

528
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,360
in classical if alice sends

529
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,440
uh a zero to bob and eve

530
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,120
takes it eve can copy the zero

531
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,679
stash stick it over here and then pass

532
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,240
on

533
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,279
the zero to bob and bob would never know

534
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,720
what happened well with the no cloning

535
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,080
theorem

536
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,279
if alice sends a zero

537
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,080
eve intercepts that zero eve looks at

538
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,399
that

539
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,080
eve basically has

540
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,600
will will try to send we'll try to copy

541
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,080
it

542
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,120
so evil no it's a zero but the thing is

543
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,559
eve cannot copy it and so what eve has

544
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,679
to do

545
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,279
is randomly send a zero or one to bob

546
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,679
eve can't do like in the classical case

547
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,240
with the classical computing

548
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,480
uh paradigm she can't make a copy of it

549
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,880
so if she takes what alice sent

550
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,080
sure she knows that it's a zero uh but

551
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,799
what she has to pass on to bob is either

552
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,520
a zero

553
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,039
or a one uh she can't just copy it

554
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,400
and that is the essence of

555
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,640
of uh what quantum key distribution

556
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,760
takes advantage of eve

557
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,760
cannot simply copy this state here

558
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,039
and send it to bob now you'd say

559
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,440
yourself okay well

560
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,640
it doesn't seem too difficult

561
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,400
to do that i mean if she knows it's an

562
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,480
if he or she knows it's a

563
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,799
if eve knows it's a zero well then just

564
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,799
send a zero to bob well it's not

565
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,639
quite that straightforward

566
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,159
so uh any any questions or anything like

567
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,200
that

568
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,320
at this point comments

569
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,360
before i get into the fun stuff

570
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,879
it's okay to interrupt at any time

571
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,480
all right so let's

572
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,840
step back for a second

573
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,440
imagine i had a machine let's

574
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,120
just call it a

575
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,880
i better i better not do that because

576
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,840
you might get you might get it confused

577
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,159
with

578
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,480
alice let's just call it

579
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,679
little a so it's a machine

580
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:24,640
and if i put in uh

581
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,279
a a value into a

582
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,880
a will repeat that value

583
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,440
like that

584
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,080
if i put in a 1

585
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,559
to a

586
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,919
a will simply do that

587
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,880
now let's say i had another machine

588
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,039
b

589
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,039
and i put in a zero there and out comes

590
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,240
a zero

591
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,840
with a b and i put in a one here

592
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,440
oops it's a b little b

593
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,960
and i get a one with a little b these

594
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,840
are little b's here

595
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,760
now however if

596
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,840
i have a here

597
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,880
and i put in a zero

598
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,039
b

599
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,120
a will fifty percent of the time

600
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,520
for spit out a zero a

601
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,279
and fifty percent of the time

602
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,960
a one a

603
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,200
and ditto would be right so

604
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,520
so let me just finish a so if i put in a

605
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,399
1b here

606
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,919
into little a into machine a fifty

607
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,520
percent of the time

608
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,159
it'll come out of zero a and fifty

609
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,440
percent of the time

610
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,799
it'll come out of one b a one a

611
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,120
and so b is essentially the same thing

612
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,159
so

613
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,919
essentially if if if you put in like a

614
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:18,960
raw

615
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
value in here it'll spit it out with the

616
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,399
a on it but if you

617
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,880
if you put in a value from the other

618
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,360
machine

619
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,799
and the same holds true with b from the

620
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,600
other machine

621
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,960
it it can't quite read it properly

622
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,600
so what it will do is it'll randomly

623
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,840
say it's a zero or randomly say it's a

624
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,320
one

625
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,679
right and b b's got the same issue

626
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:58,000
zero hey um

627
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,640
and so on

628
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,880
whoops that's a 1a see

629
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,120
this is why we should be watching kitty

630
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,439
draw

631
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,279
all right so

632
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,279
let's say alice

633
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,799
has uh

634
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,880
wants to send this key

635
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,720
what is it zero zero zero one one one

636
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,120
zero

637
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,240
zero zero zero zero one one one zero

638
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,880
alice wants to send this to bob

639
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,520
so what alice does she randomly chooses

640
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,240
between

641
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,279
machine a and b

642
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,960
so let's say um she'll do

643
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,279
a here b here a a

644
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,120
b a a b just randomly

645
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,640
so she'll kick out here

646
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,000
uh let me see how to draw this

647
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,600
so we got a zero a followed by

648
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,600
a zero b

649
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,760
followed by a zero a followed by a

650
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,559
i'm doing this backwards right because

651
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,840
you'll send these out first

652
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,760
and then a zero a and then a one b

653
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,880
a one a a one

654
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,559
a and a zero b

655
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,159
so now bob i guess i can go to full

656
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,720
screen here

657
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,240
so she sends this

658
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,840
set of values to bob and bob's over here

659
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,840
let's say bob decides well i'm going to

660
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,200
read these strings using machine a then

661
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,559
i'm going to use machine b

662
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,399
and then i'll use a and then a and then

663
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,440
a and then b and then a

664
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,519
and then i don't know b

665
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,960
because remember bob and alice aren't

666
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,399
talking they're only communicating with

667
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,559
this stuff here

668
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,320
so bob uses a

669
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,158
let me see it's the best way to do this

670
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,600
um so if bob uses a

671
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,519
and sees it so he'll get a a zero

672
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,760
right

673
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,840
here he's going to use machine b for the

674
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,880
next one

675
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,320
and so he'll correctly get a zero

676
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,519
nice here he uses a oh wow

677
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,840
that was an accident oh well so he

678
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,559
correctly gets

679
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,840
the first four bits correct

680
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,440
and then here he has a 1b

681
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,320
coming off using machine a now remember

682
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,360
over here a 1b

683
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,320
with machine a means there's a 50 chance

684
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,279
you'll get a

685
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,679
a one a or uh or a zero so let's say he

686
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,679
gets uh

687
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,159
a one

688
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,399
and here

689
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,600
let's say he's getting

690
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,279
one a machine b all right well he's got

691
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,559
a 50 50 chance

692
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,559
so let's say here he gets a zero

693
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,039
uh gets a 1a here reads it with machine

694
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:45,519
a

695
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,640
randomly so that's a correct one

696
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,120
and then here it gets a 0b and it

697
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,679
correct

698
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,840
correctly because it's the same machine

699
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,279
and he doesn't know what machine this

700
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,559
came from

701
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,918
he gets that right there

702
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,440
so you see

703
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,120
the the string matches but

704
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,240
right here and he doesn't know

705
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,159
what alice what alice sent so

706
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,480
you know he doesn't know what machine

707
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,799
alice's numbers came from he knows the

708
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,399
numbers but not what machine it came

709
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,120
from

710
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,239
so what bob then does

711
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,919
sends back the list of

712
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,679
machines he used so he sends um

713
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,120
a b a a a b

714
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,880
a b he sends his list

715
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,840
back to alice alice compares it to her

716
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,840
list

717
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,879
so alice remember she knows what she

718
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,000
sent

719
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,199
she knows what bob

720
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,320
um machines bob used so she knows

721
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,960
that bob is probably wrong

722
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,480
uh let me see

723
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,918
let me get this right a b

724
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,440
she knows that bob is going to be

725
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,119
correct

726
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,839
with these values but these two

727
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,000
uh he's got a a 50

728
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,719
chance of being incorrect with each one

729
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,239
of those

730
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,118
all right so

731
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,719
alice sends back

732
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,880
okay bob uh you are incorrect on one two

733
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,640
three four number five

734
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,440
and number six

735
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,119
so bob then says all right well these

736
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,839
i'm going to throw away and

737
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,079
therefore bob knows that these values

738
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,839
are correct

739
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,919
so

740
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:45,839
what if eve's in the picture

741
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,400
if eve was in here this is where the

742
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,200
drawing gets kind of

743
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,839
difficult

744
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,839
purple

745
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,680
goodness let me see here oh here we go

746
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
i need to take some lessons from kitty

747
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,880
here on

748
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,839
there we go okay so here's eve now keep

749
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:28,750
in mind

750
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,400
[Music]

751
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,040
if eve intercepted this the a0

752
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,240
or 0a 0b and so on

753
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,720
she can she only has

754
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,200
you know she's going to select uh let's

755
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,160
say b

756
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,920
a b a just randomly i'm going to just

757
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,040
keep it simple and so when she

758
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,200
gets the zero a uh she's got a 50

759
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,000
chance of it being right or not so she

760
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,800
has to

761
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,400
say okay well that's a zero but she

762
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,079
doesn't know that

763
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,520
and here uh that's a 50 chance of being

764
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,920
a one

765
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,680
now here she'll be correct

766
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,880
but these have the 50 chance of being

767
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,359
incorrect

768
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,400
here she measured with the same one here

769
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,079
she measured with the same one so that's

770
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,880
correct

771
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,079
here she uh

772
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,400
so these are correct this one's wrong

773
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,119
here

774
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,160
possibly it's a 50 chance of being wrong

775
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,280
remember

776
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,119
and then a so here that's a 50

777
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,160
chance of being wrong

778
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,800
so now eve needs to send

779
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,160
to make sure bob gets something

780
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,200
what does she send she sends

781
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,200
a 0 1 1 0

782
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,839
1 1 1 0.

783
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,119
now remember what bob does so bob takes

784
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,839
a look at this

785
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,280
and he should be a b

786
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,680
[Music]

787
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,040
a b a a

788
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,480
a b because eve doesn't know what alice

789
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,440
sent

790
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,880
so bob now takes this all right

791
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,000
uh that's an a so that's a zero that's

792
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,960
correct

793
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,920
got a b that one's cur it's the same oh

794
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,440
that one's the same

795
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,040
here uh so it's a zero b bob's using

796
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,880
machine a

797
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,560
so there's a 50 chance uh that it's

798
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,680
correct

799
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,240
here's a one and from machine a

800
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,520
i don't know if you can see it i wrote

801
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,320
pretty small here

802
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,680
um so machine b that's an a so there's a

803
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,800
50

804
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,800
chance that's correct

805
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,680
this one matches and zero

806
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,040
so now

807
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,640
keep in mind alice and bob don't know

808
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,280
that eve exists

809
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,520
bob sends back

810
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:28,640
the

811
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,680
of um

812
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,000
let me see

813
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,160
so he sends back the

814
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,599
string here that he used and

815
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,599
alice takes his values

816
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,440
thinking that these are correct here

817
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,680
and what she knows that this would be

818
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,160
a one and this one would be a one

819
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,640
bob sends part of his solution

820
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,920
also

821
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,530
in fact i'll i'll send eve's version

822
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:16,309
[Music]

823
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,560
when e when alice sees

824
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,400
this mistake here

825
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,400
they have now discovered that eve

826
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,440
is listening

827
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,599
so in trying to keep this short

828
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,960
boy time flies when you're having a

829
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,440
great time

830
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,319
when eve tr is

831
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,800
listening to this exchange

832
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,000
eve introduces error that goes beyond

833
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,920
the error that alice and bob would

834
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,200
expect

835
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,280
so alice would expect bob

836
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,400
to be wrong

837
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,440
if you do the math to be wrong

838
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,880
75 percent of the time

839
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,160
if ease involved

840
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,880
or to be i'm sorry to be correct 75

841
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,440
percent of the time

842
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,119
because of this

843
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,000
translation going on here if

844
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,280
that if this value is

845
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,400
becomes less than 75 percent let's say

846
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,240
63 percent alice will know instantly

847
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,079
that bob is is and and their com

848
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,640
alice and bob's conversation is being

849
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,598
watched by eve

850
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,920
because the

851
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,960
correct rate is below

852
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,400
what it should be which is 75

853
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,960
give or take a few percentage points and

854
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,760
this is not

855
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,800
over you know eight qubits here this is

856
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,440
over

857
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,400
you know a thousand cubits let's say uh

858
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:14,960
so

859
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,280
you know the the difference will will be

860
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,520
noticed

861
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,079
so in short

862
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,920
that's really what quantum key

863
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,119
distribution

864
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,960
is all about is

865
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,280
when they reconcile they think of it as

866
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,400
these two machines

867
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,640
that process the data

868
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,839
and when they reconcile

869
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,880
if the error rate is

870
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,480
greater than expected then they know eve

871
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,160
is listening let me

872
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,839
take this from the notion of machines

873
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,160
to the physics

874
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,599
and this is really kitty's department

875
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,319
more than mine

876
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,520
but the

877
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,759
what's being exchanged here are protons

878
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,280
and protons

879
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,880
very coolly enough uh let me see i think

880
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,359
i've got something in the slide here

881
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,040
might be good i mean

882
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,440
if you need roots i'll take one

883
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,839
okay

884
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,920
so protons essentially uh

885
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,160
have two ways of

886
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,839
uh what are called two bases

887
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,000
they have a

888
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,040
horizontal and vertical

889
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,040
basis and they have

890
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,359
a left and right basis or a diagonal

891
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,920
basis this is called rectilinear basis

892
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,839
and this is called a diagonal basis

893
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,960
so you could think of these two bases

894
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,240
as the machine machine a

895
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,959
and machine b

896
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,920
and if you

897
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,440
have a proton coming along

898
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,240
you know i it will be

899
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,359
in a wave form that is either that is

900
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,400
both

901
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,839
horizontal and vertical and

902
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,119
uh diagonal left and right mix photon

903
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,400
not proton

904
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,359
oops thank you

905
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,359
see i told you this is my this is not my

906
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,760
neighborhood here

907
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,640
um yeah i got to write it down so i

908
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,960
remember

909
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,079
proton right

910
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,839
all right i'll take silence is good

911
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,440
anyway photo photon

912
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,240
see like photograph yeah photon yeah

913
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,480
all right so now you know now i'm out of

914
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,280
my range here

915
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,119
so i recognize the voice um

916
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,680
so so it's just like a pair of

917
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,399
sunglasses

918
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,480
that are called polarized sunglasses so

919
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,680
that when you

920
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,520
if i had a filter a

921
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,119
polarizing filter here

922
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,400
this will block the the vertical

923
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,880
um waves

924
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,000
but allow the horizontal to

925
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,240
i'm sorry the it'll block the horizontal

926
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,280
right

927
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,960
but let the vertical waves come through

928
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,599
so you could think of this as

929
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,200
let's say machine a again

930
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,400
and it's either vertical horizontal

931
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,720
and that could be either a one or zero

932
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,200
now if i had a different

933
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,240
polarizing polarization filter a

934
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,560
polarizing filter

935
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,640
and it was on the diagonal

936
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,839
consider think of that as machine b and

937
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,119
it will let

938
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,560
only left or right

939
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,880
one of these through which is either the

940
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:57,839
zero or one

941
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,040
so that is essentially how quantum key

942
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,880
distribution

943
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,240
works and what's interesting

944
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,960
here is that if you go back to

945
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,560
good old plain old cryptography

946
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,839
when you have a message

947
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,960
and you have a

948
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,240
a keypad

949
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:39,839
or a key value that's used once only

950
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,880
so if i had this as my key

951
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,200
and i use it once

952
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,800
according to one of the gurus claude

953
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,359
shannon

954
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:03,200
shannon is that this is impossible

955
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,359
to be

956
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,680
and so using this

957
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,480
quantum key distribution technique

958
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,160
you have a one-time pad that matches the

959
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:24,880
data so

960
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,440
let's say you had a thousand bytes or a

961
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,720
thousand bits of data

962
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,880
you would have a quantum key

963
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,359
of 1000 bits qubits

964
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,960
paired up with that and those qubits

965
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,280
are this key here just as i described

966
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,200
using the two machines or

967
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,879
the photons

968
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,880
so i think that's enough for now that

969
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,440
should give you

970
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,240
a basis for there's plenty of videos out

971
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,040
there

972
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,240
plenty of writing about what i described

973
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,839
is called bb 84.

974
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,680
so it's my belief that

975
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,680
with what i discussed here you should be

976
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,280
able to watch a bb 84 video

977
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,040
and uh follow along they typically

978
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,680
start with the physics but what i

979
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,680
decided to try to do here is start with

980
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,280
the logic behind it

981
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,040
and then get into the physics which is

982
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,279
where

983
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,079
protons photons you know i can get that

984
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,720
all mixed up

985
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,839
that's really i can't believe it's

986
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,799
already 320.

987
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,000
uh i could go on and on but that's

988
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
basically the gist of what's called bb

989
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,599
84. charles bennett by the way is still

990
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,599
at ibm

991
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,440
and he has a few talks out there to be

992
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,880
well worth watching

993
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,079
uh there's also a uh

994
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,119
a revised version called

995
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,200
b i think it's 92 where instead of

996
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,240
uh he's used instead of using

997
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,359
both bases that's these guys here or

998
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,119
both machines

999
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,760
it's a technique that actually just

1000
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,040
utilizes

1001
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,520
uh one of the machines either the

1002
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,440
horizontal vertical

1003
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,640
the rectilinear or the diagonal bases

1004
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,359
here

1005
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:35,280
or filter let me just end with this

1006
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,079
slide here one way to get your head

1007
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,559
around this

1008
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,359
uh finally uh and i have the stuff at

1009
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:44,160
the office

1010
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,079
at the campus but i haven't been there

1011
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,520
in six months so

1012
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,760
i just have to use some pictures here

1013
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,800
imagine i have two pairs of sunglasses

1014
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,200
one here one here and i put them on top

1015
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,480
of one another

1016
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,760
and i turn them at a diagon uh make them

1017
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,760
perpendicular to one another

1018
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,960
uh what i'll see is zero light here

1019
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,040
okay it'll block all the light so this

1020
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,000
is this

1021
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,079
is think of it as a filter going like

1022
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,839
like this

1023
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,359
on the bottom and then the one on the

1024
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,359
top goes like this so what do you get

1025
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,160
you get no light

1026
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,000
now imagine i take a third

1027
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,760
filter let's call the third filter eve

1028
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,000
and i insert it between these two

1029
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,920
filters here

1030
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,880
you'll see i'll get some light so this

1031
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,480
is a physical real world example

1032
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,160
of uh you know this

1033
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,280
this technique in operation with

1034
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,160
a man in the middle here affecting the

1035
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,359
outcome

1036
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,920
uh i would i should not you know if eve

1037
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,359
was not there i would have complete

1038
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,559
darkness

1039
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,359
but if i take a polarizing filter and

1040
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:58,720
stick it between

1041
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,319
uh these two filters here these two

1042
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,000
pairs of sunglasses

1043
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,079
uh actually i'll have and this is

1044
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,319
between this is not on top or behind it

1045
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,559
it's in between these two i actually

1046
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,079
have more light coming out

1047
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,359
than if i only had the two

1048
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,839
and that's it from here way over time as

1049
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:18,160
usual

1050
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,440
any questions comments

1051
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,079
i tried to compete with uh kitty on the

1052
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,040
drawing i don't know

1053
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,240
i even came close not really compete

1054
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:30,880
thank you

1055
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,760
for for doing this your drawing makes it

1056
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,760
much easier

1057
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,160
i mean i think yeah it's pretty much the

1058
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,160
same as what you did i have to tidy it

1059
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,040
up

1060
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,160
and i can probably

1061
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,800
show it put it into a one page or two

1062
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,839
pages

1063
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:54,558
next week
