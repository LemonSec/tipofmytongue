00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,160
hi

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,559
um so i'm going to teach this course

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,280
mainly about geometry and then about

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,079
rhino

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,920
as well i like to kind of bounce around

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,720
to all the different parts of rhino

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,760
rather than

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,279
going deep and learning every single

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,800
tool in one part

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,720
because i think if you know a little bit

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,320
about everything

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,079
in this youtube google era if you

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,680
understand what can be done

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,280
and a little bit about how to do one or

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,280
two things it's quite easy to search

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,719
your way or to find

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,160
all those extra tools so the five weeks

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,120
of this course

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,640
are going to jump between the major

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,120
areas of rhino

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,559
different types of geometry that i kind

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,320
of cover in this introduction

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,039
uh and then we'll i'll do some slides at

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,199
the beginning of this

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,160
lecture today and introduce the kind of

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,039
3d design

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,600
as a sort of whole and then onto rhino

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,120
and we'll like learn how to use the

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,239
software

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,680
um if you haven't downloaded the

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,600
software i presume you have at this

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,159
stage but there's a 90 day free trial

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,200
um of rhino7 some of you may be using

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,400
905 or

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,439
6 or mac version um

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,600
the mac version is slightly different in

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,439
terms of its layout same tools but just

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,960
slightly different layout

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,119
um and that's that

41
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,159
so i love this project

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,000
um which kind of gets a little bit

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,680
started about me i was in

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
london in 2008 working at a sort of

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,560
large corporate architecture practice

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,439
that does

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,119
many of the world's tallest buildings

48
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,479
and they had

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,360
extra budget i guess to do cool projects

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,119
and they had within the office this

51
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:47,439
group

52
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,520
people call the smart geometry unit that

53
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,159
were also in other of the sort of large

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
big skyscraper architects and

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,360
one of them was sort of a had just

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,680
finished his phd from mit and others

57
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,719
had studied in london at the

58
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,719
architecture association or aaa

59
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,439
in the drl program and the drl is the

60
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,560
design research lab

61
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,520
and this was a sort of a project they

62
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,038
did in 2008

63
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,640
just to show what they had learned in

64
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,200
this sort of second masters program

65
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,040
in london and it kind of differentiates

66
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,200
how i think about design software and

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,319
geometry

68
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,000
because my undergraduate degree was

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,640
uh hand-drawn we we did drawings for

70
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,000
architecture by hand if we did

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,760
perspectives we set up

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,640
um sort of fading points and did lots of

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,400
lines and lots of measurements on the

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,599
paper

75
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,400
and when i went to london i was sort of

76
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,760
immersed in this world of digital

77
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
geometry

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
and i think when many of the people from

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,879
my undergrad learned

80
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,440
autocad they were doing the exact same

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,080
things

82
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,400
people done for decades in that they

83
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,760
weren't using the software to do

84
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,879
anything new and i think that gave them

85
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,160
a lot of frustration because

86
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
some of the professors liked drawing by

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,920
hand because they weren't

88
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,840
really doing anything on the computer

89
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,000
that you couldn't do by hand

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,920
rhino and other softwares that we'll

91
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
cover or kind of introduce

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,159
really do do new things and that sort of

93
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,040
sets up

94
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,519
this change from what you can do on pen

95
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,200
and paper and what you can do

96
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,920
with mathematics and algorithms and

97
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,840
that's sort of an old and then new

98
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,239
and i think many people know autocad or

99
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,920
other drafting softwares and they aren't

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,519
really doing anything new with it

101
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,879
so in this course we're going to sort of

102
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,599
cover what's new in geometry and

103
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,920
why you would need this software or can

104
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,799
use the software to do those new things

105
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,560
so as a basic introduction starting at

106
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,319
the very beginning of all

107
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,879
computer graphics i just like to um

108
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,120
explain the sort of origin story

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,599
um if on the left we have a grid of 30

110
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,680
by 30 squares and we label some black

111
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,720
and some white

112
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,959
we can kind of draw a circle or

113
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,400
something that's recognizable as a

114
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,439
circle

115
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,640
this is sort of a pixel model of drawing

116
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,480
and on the right hand side we have

117
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,879
a precise measurement with a center

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,760
point at 15

119
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,000
and 15 and a radius of eight

120
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,319
[Music]

121
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,239
on the left hand side we call this

122
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,799
raster graphics and all photographs

123
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,000
many of you are probably familiar with

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,519
this stuff but all photographs are

125
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,440
raster graphics where each of those

126
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,238
squares is colored a different color and

127
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,680
three thousand by three thousand squares

128
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
would be nine

129
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,560
million pixels or nine megapixels

130
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
when you zoom in on the master graphics

131
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,919
it will always fade to this grid the

132
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,520
grid is sort of always there it might be

133
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,800
just really really small

134
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,320
on the right hand side vector graphics

135
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
are mathematically defined

136
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
uh therefore if you zoom in on it it

137
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,600
will always be a crisp

138
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,520
edge the major two softwares for

139
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,759
2d drawing for graphic designers and

140
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,560
because i've done

141
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,479
use them a lot but our photoshop and

142
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,000
illustrator and they they create them as

143
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,440
separate softwares because they really

144
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,320
are

145
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,040
two different giants two different sort

146
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,680
of

147
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,800
underlying ways they work

148
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,320
when we look at 3d the same is true

149
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,800
voxels are pixels volumetric pixels

150
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,680
and they're sort of 3d pixels and on the

151
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,560
right we have

152
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,080
mathematically defined uh shapes

153
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,199
that can be more accurate they

154
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,120
contain a lot on all sort of vector

155
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,280
drawing compared to raster drawing

156
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
vector drawings are far more efficient

157
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,199
when it comes to a file type as well

158
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,960
there's a lot less polygonal points

159
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,560
defined in the model therefore there's

160
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,080
just a lot less geometry

161
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,960
there's a lot less

162
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,000
tiny file sizes as a relative comparison

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,720
the

164
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,039
major foxhole program that you may know

165
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:39,919
or game is

166
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,240
minecraft in this the whole world is

167
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
defined by

168
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,560
physical blocks and transparent blocks

169
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
that you can walk through and

170
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,160
some of them are textured as grass and

171
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,000
some are wood and some are stone but

172
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,960
they are all

173
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,840
just an entire grid of cubes and you can

174
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,600
kind of manipulate them as you want and

175
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,720
it's sort of

176
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,919
because you're able to manipulate them

177
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,319
in the game it is in a way a 3d design

178
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,919
software if you were to

179
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,199
kind of use it to create geometry uh

180
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,319
another form of voxel geometry is mri

181
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:10,880
scans

182
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,919
they take uh images through the body at

183
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,759
sort of set intervals and then you can

184
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,840
make 3d models out of the geometry that

185
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
you do through an mri scan

186
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,520
this is a project i did just on ornament

187
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
and

188
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
voxels where we this is human

189
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
body made through symmetry and tidied up

190
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,520
in rhino

191
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,919
taught by tobias klein but it shows sort

192
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:32,560
of

193
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
learning about other types of geometry

194
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,919
for vector geometry mathematical

195
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,240
geometry we might split

196
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
them again subdivide them into two and

197
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,080
come up with surface and solids we can

198
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,360
make a sphere in

199
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,800
both types of geometry but in one

200
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
it is hollow and then the other one it's

201
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,479
solid and that's quite different for

202
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,160
if we were to take a bite out of each of

203
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,840
those what the resulting geometry would

204
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,400
be

205
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,599
if we were to bite out of them solid

206
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,000
programs generally are popular with

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
engineers

208
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,319
um particularly a program called

209
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,479
solidworks another one called creo they

210
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,360
tend to be

211
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,240
really really expensive 5000 plus or

212
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,919
4000 plus dollars

213
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,120
to buy they do things

214
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,560
that surface geometry can't do um

215
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,479
and then some of the surface geometry

216
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,560
sort of fakes that way to be solid when

217
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,919
you want it to be which we'll cover in

218
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:24,880
this course but

219
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,360
rhino is a surface geometry software

220
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,160
therefore

221
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,639
all geometry you create it thinks is

222
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,039
hollow

223
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
that's its back end uh one of the big

224
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,440
problems with solid geometry

225
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,199
um or people who are very used to using

226
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,479
solid geometry sulfur

227
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,319
is filleting solids or kind of cutting

228
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,840
away solids so

229
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,479
if you were to do the uh digital

230
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,199
equivalent

231
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,800
of using a router bit to cut away the

232
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
edge as you would do with this wood

233
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,720
that's quite easy and solid works in

234
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
rhino it just becomes a bit of a hassle

235
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,280
but you can kind of do it okay

236
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,680
surface geometry is then further

237
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,319
self-split

238
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,440
into a couple of different types and

239
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,599
nerves non-uniform rational beast lines

240
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,360
not something you need to know but

241
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,919
is a type of mathematical modeling and

242
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,360
i'll come to that one last

243
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,919
mesh modeling or polygonal modeling is

244
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,720
where we have

245
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,360
points defined in 3d space and we have

246
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,560
flat geometry

247
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
straight lines between the points so we

248
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,000
can do a quad

249
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,800
mesh or a triangular mesh um that's more

250
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
of a mathematical problem to which type

251
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,399
of mesh we want to do

252
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,519
but um there is no curved

253
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,679
geometry in that sphere therefore that

254
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,719
sphere will never truly be

255
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,440
round we can simulate it as round but

256
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
its underlying geometry will always be

257
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,160
these flat

258
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,760
faceted pieces and on the right

259
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,240
we have subdivision geometry and that's

260
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,279
a sort of variant

261
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,279
kind of between the two but more

262
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,040
polygonal model mesh model

263
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,959
where we have points in 3d space we have

264
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,959
flat planes between those

265
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,640
uh points we need sort of less points

266
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
and when we smooth it in the software

267
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,240
you end up with

268
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,360
this tab in rhino's tab on tab off

269
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,720
but you end up with these patches so

270
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
in all forms of 3d software having too

271
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,760
much geometry

272
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,160
is really hard to edit because we just

273
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
want one point and to pull it and the

274
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,920
things to happen if we have 100 points

275
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,279
which point do we grab and it becomes

276
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,959
really hard so you're always looking to

277
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:27,360
have

278
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,720
as little geometry to control the shape

279
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,680
that you want and

280
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,080
not really much more so meshes are kind

281
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,519
of a little harder to work with they

282
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,080
have

283
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
different kind of tools that are a

284
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,920
little like sculpture where you push on

285
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,200
them and it pushes all the points in

286
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,720
slightly but more towards the center

287
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,760
they tend to be more around gaming

288
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,399
so low poly is gaming high poly is more

289
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,080
animation

290
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,680
subdivision modeling is also associated

291
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,560
with animation nerves modeling

292
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,839
kind of like the factor circles is

293
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,760
efficient from a file size perspective

294
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,279
but more importantly

295
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,440
between the polygonal points there can

296
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,640
be curves

297
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,120
a mathematical model does not need the

298
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
shapes between each of the points to be

299
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,200
flat they can be curved and as a result

300
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,040
we can be far more precise

301
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,800
with the type of geometries we create

302
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
and if we're going to engineer these

303
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
products or build them in the real world

304
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
um we really want to be accurate with

305
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
the shapes that we're creating

306
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,720
so i would or kind of generally thought

307
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
of as polygonal modeling

308
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,040
is fast and very useful for animation

309
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,399
uh but nurbs is where all

310
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,040
or solid or surface mathematical

311
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,720
modeling is where all engineering

312
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,839
architecture

313
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,839
jewelry anything that's going to be made

314
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,000
physical because you want what you draw

315
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,519
on the screen to be at least somewhat

316
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,160
accurate

317
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,279
in the product that you finally make

318
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,320
so um one of the offices i work for oma

319
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,440
uh quite a fan's office and they

320
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
work a lot with blue foam models and

321
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,120
blue foam is cut using a hot wire cutter

322
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,399
so you just sort of

323
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,640
that's hot wire and you push the phone

324
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,440
through it

325
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,600
and i really think the tools that you

326
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,959
use

327
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,320
uh the final geometries you create are

328
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
dependent on those tools so the blue

329
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,240
foam models you can almost recognize the

330
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,760
buildings even though

331
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
this is not a building made from blue

332
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,920
foam it's still the geometry that was

333
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,880
created using

334
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,360
a blue phone prototyping method when you

335
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,480
look at this final

336
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,399
project by zahadeed in azerbaijan

337
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,240
um it was very clearly kind of a

338
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,600
subdivision model

339
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,200
uh on a on a computer and

340
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,839
i kind of knowing all the tools and a

341
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,200
range of softwares

342
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,880
start to look at buildings or any

343
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
physical product and i'll kind of

344
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,640
have a fairly good guess what software

345
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,639
they use to design it and have a fairly

346
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,000
good guess what

347
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,399
specific tools they might use to get

348
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,800
there so it and hopefully it will become

349
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,680
kind of obvious to

350
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,800
all of you as well um

351
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,440
the first uh 3d model uh ever created

352
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,519
was using bezier curves and we'll cover

353
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,600
different types of curves next week but

354
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,760
this was the utah teapot where

355
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,959
martin newell was doing his phd in utah

356
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,959
and they created this mathematical

357
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,399
modeling remodeling

358
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
and they didn't know what uh model

359
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,760
they'd send around the world to say we

360
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,560
did it they were

361
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,279
instead of pyramid or cube and his wife

362
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,959
said why don't you send our teapot

363
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,639
and they model this teapot and it's the

364
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,160
first file ever since so it's kind of

365
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,920
the hello world of 3d

366
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,120
and when people are testing their

367
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,880
rendering settings they still use this

368
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,839
teapot as a sort of

369
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,639
uh it appears as references in a lot of

370
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,920
uh

371
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,120
3d things there was a music video that

372
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,959
did it and simpsons did it when homer

373
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,079
went into 3d

374
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,360
toy story you see it here um also andy

375
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,240
the character

376
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,959
in toy story is possibly named after

377
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,880
andy van dam on andy's bookshelf is

378
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,639
visual programming by andy van dam which

379
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
no kid that age would have he's a

380
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,480
professor famous professor at brown

381
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,279
university

382
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,639
on computer graphics and toy story

383
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,160
used the first toy story which is 1995.

384
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,480
this is scud the dog and the first toy

385
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,320
story was done in mathematical modeling

386
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,279
it was done in nurbs

387
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,560
and as a result it's it's not uh great

388
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,360
for these kind of

389
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,279
very fluid and flexible and smooth

390
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,880
shapes

391
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,320
because scud has no fur um

392
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,000
some of the zoomed up shots look pretty

393
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,680
bad uh and

394
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,079
as you kind of see pixar evolve every

395
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,360
single

396
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,519
film they made their sort of giant leaps

397
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,200
in sort of the geometry

398
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,639
uh for each one um fur is possible

399
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,480
by the time of uh monsters inc

400
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,680
and this is sort of

401
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,279
um the animation process for

402
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,440
uh pixar just found something online it

403
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,560
may or may not be accurate it's just

404
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,120
from the core

405
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,160
post but they used autodesk maya for 3d

406
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,959
modeling

407
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,680
geometry then they probably set the

408
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,800
materials in maya

409
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,360
i gas and they do the rigging in model

410
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,000
maya

411
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,079
so rigging is uh this process that

412
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,160
you'll see here where the face

413
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,680
as i said before you want the least

414
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,199
amount of geometry to do all of your

415
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,160
control

416
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,800
so you have these uh kind of rigs that

417
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,279
you can

418
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,199
move the eyebrows up and down and when

419
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,040
they're setting the animation

420
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,639
they're just really moving the character

421
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,320
rigs which all the

422
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,839
hundreds of thousands of legal points

423
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,120
are controlled by the rates so in that

424
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,600
way you're controlling the whole process

425
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,279
and pixar use a whole range of other

426
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,720
softwares presto being

427
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
their in-house software that doesn't get

428
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,000
outside their office and

429
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,120
can apply commercially

430
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
in sort of an architecture process you

431
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
might do the modeling in rhino

432
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,519
material lighting rendering are usually

433
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,639
done out of house if you're

434
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,199
if you do professional stuff with firms

435
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,079
like lexicon

436
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,399
or haze davidson where sort of 5000

437
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,800
pounds per image or some price like that

438
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,959
and um but ultimately you can do 3d

439
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,880
modeling draw the geometry

440
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,639
then kind of like setting meta

441
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,839
information you're going to set those

442
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,720
materials

443
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,560
which is sort of setting the color the

444
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,440
texture maybe with the jpeg

445
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,480
then setting the glossiness

446
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,639
the opacity the um if it's water or

447
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,959
glass the refractive index and kind of

448
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,760
you just draw

449
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
any shapes you want and then you set

450
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,120
these settings and it becomes that

451
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,160
material

452
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,440
then they would somebody else would do

453
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,360
the lighting for the model

454
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,240
rendering takes up to a day or two days

455
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,079
on a computer to really get the high

456
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,519
quality renders out

457
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,720
and in architecture they might insert

458
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,399
that back into a photograph a sort of

459
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,639
aerial photograph taken by drone

460
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,000
to make it really photorealistic another

461
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
thing you could do is do 3d modeling and

462
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,240
then just

463
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,519
export the line work uh to

464
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,160
a sort of illustrator um rhino one of

465
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,600
the best things about rhino is it has

466
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
tons of files types that you can import

467
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,519
into it and tons of file types that you

468
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,040
can export from it

469
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,959
so this would this is big architects in

470
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,000
copenhagen and

471
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,519
i know they're processed very well

472
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,360
worked in this other office

473
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,040
um in copenhagen it used to be the same

474
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,880
office and that would be

475
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,199
3d models in rhino exported and brought

476
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,639
into adobe illustrator

477
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,160
and that's just making the line work

478
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,759
nice maybe coloring it a little bit

479
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,959
adding arrows

480
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,079
and this is a proposal for a really fun

481
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,079
hotel that was you could ski on the roof

482
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,519
to learn how to ski and then go up the

483
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,079
slope

484
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,320
which is that green slope or red slope

485
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,759
depending on what side

486
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,880
you wanted to ski down on the roof

487
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,759
another thing to use a 3d geometry for

488
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,600
is you would model something in rhino

489
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,720
when i was in college we learned a

490
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,639
program called ecotect which was bought

491
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,399
by autodesk but i've never used this

492
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,160
ladybug honeybee but it's a plug-in for

493
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,800
a rhino

494
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,160
that does looks like it does the same

495
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,040
thing where you 3d modeled the geometry

496
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,279
um these sulfurs generally know you

497
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,440
input the city it knows where the sun is

498
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,120
at every single time of the year

499
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,279
and it shows you exactly how much light

500
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,880
is going to get in through each window

501
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,000
in each direction

502
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,680
if you model all the surrounding

503
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,519
buildings it will take account for

504
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,039
shadows and you can see the shadows

505
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,079
throughout the year

506
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,880
and really plan the size of your windows

507
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,000
based on the feedback that you would

508
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,039
make in these kind of models

509
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,520
and just on plug-ins right now has tons

510
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,880
of plugins

511
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,280
a lot of a very strong online community

512
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,240
for

513
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,919
asking questions to in the form of

514
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,599
forums or

515
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,119
sometimes the software developers

516
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,640
themselves get involved and answer your

517
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,760
questions

518
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,520
there's a lot of youtube videos so that

519
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,360
there's really a great community to

520
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,720
learn new skills

521
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,000
beyond the introduction uh this is uh

522
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,360
my own uh machine which is this tnc

523
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:39,840
machine

524
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,200
and on this you're kind of drawing

525
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,120
furniture in as a line work and then

526
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,880
bringing it into a cam software and

527
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,720
telling the tool path to follow

528
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,679
the paths that were created in mino and

529
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,600
press go and

530
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,039
furniture so

531
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,799
all these softwares will have xyz

532
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,880
coordinates and in rhino and

533
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
in solidworks and anything that we're

534
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,640
making physical products the z-axis is

535
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,840
vertical

536
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,080
in film software they think of x and y

537
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,240
as the screen where y is vertical

538
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,640
and z is off the screen so if you are

539
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,320
ever using any of those softwares

540
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,679
you might need to reset it you can

541
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,600
always reset the xyz

542
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,520
to anything you want it to be the

543
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,799
origin point or zero zero zero is

544
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,880
um uh uh

545
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,480
on minor where we're going to sort of

546
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,160
insert the units when we open the model

547
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,880
so we don't need any units after we tell

548
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,400
the program what units we're going to

549
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,640
use um they can be light years

550
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,320
they can be millimeters they can be

551
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,679
nanometers they can be whatever you want

552
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,880
or inches

553
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,520
um but after that point the software is

554
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,880
just going to think in 0

555
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,760
10 100 000 it it just wants numbers it

556
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,880
doesn't want to know

557
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,720
those dimensions afterwards if you're

558
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,000
going to print a page

559
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,880
or uh export a 3d print it might be

560
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,840
useful to know whether you're in

561
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,120
millimeters or light years because

562
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,919
that's

563
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,000
potentially going to have problems but

564
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
um we're going to

565
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,080
sort of insert coordinates in in the

566
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,120
format of

567
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,160
x comma y comma z

568
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,280
uh and no punctuation at the end

569
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,520
so if we want to point and we're asked

570
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,039
the position of the point

571
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,799
we're gonna put three comma three comma

572
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,880
three

573
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,640
um all geometry i'm just gonna go

574
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,320
through the types of geometry in rhino

575
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,240
and then we'll jump into the software

576
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,919
um so points is the smallest

577
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,679
unit of rhino and everything in rhino

578
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,520
whether you draw it or draw something

579
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,240
more complicated is composed of points

580
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,000
so it's sort of the electron or the

581
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,200
the smallest unit in the sulfur

582
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,760
a curve oh also just note that a point

583
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,799
is pt

584
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,080
uh and knowing the shorthand

585
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,760
abbreviations of each of these

586
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,640
is particularly useful for using the

587
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,039
software efficiently

588
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,919
uh a curve is any line whether it is

589
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,360
curved or not curved

590
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,559
just all lines are called curves and

591
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,799
their shorthand is c or v

592
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,720
um there are a few different types of

593
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,320
curves but we're going to cover them

594
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,159
next week um a curve can be

595
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,320
open which just means it's open and

596
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,280
it's selection uh shorthand is is open

597
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,000
curve

598
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,360
uh if you're going to get into coding

599
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,919
the the capital letters matter but

600
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,240
otherwise it's not so important

601
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,760
and then you can have a closed curve

602
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,159
a closed curve can become a surface an

603
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,159
open curve cannot because it doesn't

604
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,440
can't finish off the geometry um and

605
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,600
a surface can be planar if it is flat

606
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
it's called planar if it's flat

607
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,480
or it can be um sort of curvy

608
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,320
then if you were to extrude that up it

609
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,640
would be a poly surface

610
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,200
that could be open or closed a closed

611
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,080
poly surface means that it's airtight

612
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
that means for 3d printing you can only

613
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,320
print closed poly surfaces

614
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,559
and if there is some bad geometry that

615
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,919
somebody

616
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,320
left a nanometer open that would be open

617
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,840
geometry and 3d printer just wouldn't

618
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,600
see it so

619
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,559
knowing that closed geometry is

620
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,400
perfectly airtight closed is quite

621
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
important

622
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,240
and there's close poly surface and

623
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,679
abbreviation

624
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,600
plus plugs so everything

625
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,320
when you're drawing is some version of

626
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,720
points curves or surfaces

627
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,320
um when rhino thinks about solids it's

628
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,600
really just thinking about

629
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,200
closed poly surfaces um

630
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,240
there's no true solid in rhino there's

631
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,720
just

632
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,880
closed voice and most of the tools

633
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,240
are going from one of these types

634
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,720
up or down to another one so if you

635
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,200
extrude a curve it becomes a surface

636
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,039
if you extrude surface it becomes a poly

637
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,280
surface if you

638
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,720
want to duplicate edges on the

639
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,520
surface or the polysurface it becomes a

640
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,400
curve

641
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,640
if you divide a curve it becomes a point

642
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,400
so you're just moving up and down

643
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,840
this ladder of geometry

644
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,720
and um just to cover some tools scale

645
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,440
when

646
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,559
d is uh what you can type into rhino and

647
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,120
and you'll

648
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,280
sort of scale it in one direction uh

649
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,679
rhino has

650
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,559
a lot of time if you type what you think

651
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,840
it might be

652
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,679
a lot of the time that is the name of

653
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,960
the command and it just

654
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,840
works so if you just can't remember the

655
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,600
name of something just type it and

656
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,280
i'll show you when we open software and

657
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,720
it'll probably work and then a lot of

658
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,360
time there's

659
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,000
more than one command or that does the

660
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,760
exact same thing so stretch

661
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,159
and scale 1d will do the exact same

662
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,559
thing at least in this example

663
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,320
scale 2d will move into two dimensions

664
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,600
and scale 3d will

665
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,320
move it in three dimensions so we're

666
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,799
going to

667
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,280
open software now and i'm going to draw

668
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,000
this model

669
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,679
it's it's quite a simple geometry but

670
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,360
i'm just going to show you how to draw

671
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,000
it

672
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and there is my contact information that

673
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,520
if you need to contact me you can ask

674
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,679
questions

675
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,960
so this is the rhino interface

676
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,559
so you see these four windows maybe you

677
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,240
might be able to start there top

678
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,440
front right and perspective

679
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
at the very top of the page is the file

680
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,000
menu and you can see

681
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,919
the names of the weeks that i'm going to

682
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,679
cover curves surfaces sub d

683
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,600
solid each of those has various menus

684
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,880
of every tool in the curve menu

685
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,120
there are each of the tools available as

686
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,880
icons which is repeating the information

687
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,400
but if you want to use icons as opposed

688
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,520
to the file menu

689
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,760
you can do it that way so we have curve

690
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,520
tools here surface tools

691
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,760
and changing that changes both the

692
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,720
sidebar and this top bar

693
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,960
and solids subteas standard

694
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,840
and down the bottom is all about

695
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,039
accuracy

696
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,159
um so here we have uh

697
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,159
the snaps which are currently grayed out

698
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,440
because i need to click

699
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,559
the o snap is turned on i know snap

700
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,480
should almost always be turned on

701
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,960
planar should almost always be turned on

702
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,559
um when you download the software for

703
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,559
the first time they're off so i

704
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,240
turn them on ortho we're going to turn

705
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,039
on as well now so planar is just

706
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,559
uh if i'm in any view and i draw a line

707
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,158
that it will be at the same height

708
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,279
in all views if that's not on sometimes

709
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,279
the second point can be

710
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,960
a thousand meters higher than the first

711
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,120
point and it really messes things up so

712
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,320
planar should

713
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,039
say almost always be on ortho just means

714
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,760
i will be

715
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,039
locked to go

716
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,360
vertical or horizontal in each view

717
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,880
if you want to make really curvy

718
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,799
geometry you need orthodoxy off

719
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,039
but for now let's just leave that on and

720
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,360
then oh snap

721
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,159
is our various snaps and i'm going to

722
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:10,960
cover them when i

723
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,200
when i open up some geometry the command

724
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,440
line is the third option for how you

725
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,080
could

726
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,520
input commands into rhino um it's by far

727
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,279
my favorite and pretty much the only

728
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,440
thing i use which i type in the commands

729
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,159
and

730
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,320
if you just type box box will be a

731
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,360
command

732
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,480
and you get a box

733
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,279
and if you type sphere it goes here if

734
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:33,919
you type

735
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,919
curve from there so um

736
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,000
the first thing we're going to do

737
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,799
is change perspective view um the

738
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,000
viewport menus

739
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,120
so it's quite normal to have top

740
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,120
front and right which are kind of like

741
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
plan section elevation

742
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,240
um as wireframe which

743
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,400
just means you can just see the lines

744
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,279
but for

745
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,520
perspective view we have the option of

746
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,440
shaded rendered or ghosted

747
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,159
and a whole load more but ghosted just

748
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:06,640
means

749
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,279
that if there are surfaces that we see

750
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,080
them as

751
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,039
shaded and rendered means we will see it

752
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,760
as a solid

753
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,279
so ghosted is generally what perspective

754
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,159
would be set to for modeling and i'm

755
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,039
going to

756
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,200
delete this box and draw one more time

757
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,440
so

758
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
from the menu on the left here you can

759
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,880
select a box by left clicking it

760
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,679
some of the commands if you see this

761
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,000
tool

762
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,360
tip that it shows that the if i left

763
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,200
click this one i get hide objects and if

764
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,320
i right click

765
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,760
i get show objects um so sometimes left

766
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,640
and right click

767
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,480
might react differently with some of the

768
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,840
tools that doesn't that's not true for

769
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,720
all tools

770
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,279
and then if i hold down and left click

771
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,559
and i just hold it down for like four

772
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,360
four seconds

773
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,679
this menu pops up with lots of types of

774
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,440
solids

775
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,039
and if i click off that disappears but

776
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,799
if i hold it down again

777
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,679
and i drag it out it becomes a sort of

778
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,799
menu that states there

779
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,640
and similarly there's lots of different

780
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,080
types of boxes and

781
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,480
that generally is if i wanted to draw a

782
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,520
box

783
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,440
um let's say if i wanted to draw a

784
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,039
sphere do i want to

785
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,919
enter the center first and then the

786
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,840
radius or do i want to enter

787
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,679
three points on the surface and just

788
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,960
create the sphere to fit those three

789
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,600
points

790
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,399
or some other variant of them so there's

791
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,840
different starting points for how you

792
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,399
want to

793
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,080
what kind of inputs you want to give it

794
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
in order to get the geometry you want

795
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,240
so if i start by creating a box and

796
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,880
from the command point it will sort of

797
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,480
ask me questions

798
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,640
and you always kind of want to look to

799
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,760
that top left

800
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,240
part of the screen to see what is it

801
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,679
asking for

802
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,200
um so in this case it's asking for the

803
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,279
first corner of the base

804
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,840
if i was to left click on model that

805
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,960
would place

806
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,440
the first corner of the base but it

807
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,159
would be a

808
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,159
highly inaccurate way of doing it it

809
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,120
would just be like placing it randomly

810
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,039
where i feel like it to be if i type

811
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,240
zero zero

812
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,799
comma zero comma zero

813
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,799
now the first corner is exactly on the

814
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,640
origin point

815
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,480
then it asks me a second question other

816
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,880
corner of base or length

817
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,760
so if i enter a number that would be the

818
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,320
length

819
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,679
if i enter another number comma number

820
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,480
comma number that would be where the

821
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,520
point in space

822
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,559
so i'm just going to put 100. when you

823
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,440
open the model you'll be asked

824
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,200
millimeters or light years or

825
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,000
kilometers or whatever the hundred is

826
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,600
those units but it really doesn't matter

827
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
for this lecture what units you entered

828
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,559
and then with uh press enter to use

829
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,200
length

830
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,320
so i enter the number 100 and you guys

831
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,240
hopefully can see that 100 is entered

832
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,399
there i press enter

833
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,440
and that's that and then height one more

834
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,080
number

835
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,600
100. so now i've created the cube but i

836
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,559
can't see it because i'm

837
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,880
far too zoomed in and you can select

838
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,640
the cube and type

839
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,799
zoom and it's going to give you a bunch

840
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,399
of options

841
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,440
these options that are kind of being

842
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,080
highlighted

843
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,720
are i can click on them or i can type

844
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,960
them or i can type the first letter

845
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,360
or the underlined letter so i want to

846
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,520
say extense

847
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,039
that only did perspective so i can type

848
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,240
zoom and click all

849
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,360
which is all views and extents and now

850
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:41,919
all

851
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,399
four of my views zoom to the box that i

852
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,279
just

853
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,760
created

854
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,760
so if i double click

855
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,860
on any of these views they become

856
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,720
[Music]

857
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,480
they take over the whole screen and if i

858
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,080
double click on them again

859
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,760
they go back to the the for menu

860
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,520
so if i uh zoom out

861
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,559
and um if you have a three-point mouse

862
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,279
wheel that's

863
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,159
particularly useful when modeling um if

864
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:16,720
not you

865
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,880
can use i mean if you get used to it you

866
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,320
can use a computer mouse

867
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,120
but um if you move the mouse wheel up

868
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,840
and down

869
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,279
that's going to zoom in and out of your

870
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,960
model um

871
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,320
if you have a laptop mouse two fingers

872
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,039
up down will zoom in and out of a model

873
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:33,600
so that's

874
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,799
uh important to do right click

875
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,840
and hold will

876
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,120
orbit around the model

877
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,960
and right click

878
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,159
and holding shift and holding right

879
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,360
click

880
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,080
and moving it will pan the model so kind

881
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,320
of like just pushing across like this

882
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,240
they are different if i double click on

883
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,399
perspective and i go to any of these

884
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,519
views

885
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,679
i'm not going to orbit in a top view or

886
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,760
front view but i would need to pan so

887
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,559
right click

888
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,039
in this case would be pan and just kind

889
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,559
of drag the model left or right

890
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,760
two fingers up down or the click wheel

891
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,640
will zoom in and out of the model

892
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
like that and again i can just click the

893
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,039
model assume all

894
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,440
and i could type selected or extensively

895
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,159
have it selected

896
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,559
so if i try to create another shape um

897
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,120
let's do a pyramid so we have this menu

898
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,840
that we

899
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,880
sort of lifted earlier and

900
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,000
it's gonna number all sides is one of

901
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,080
the options it's currently set to five

902
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,159
if i click that it says how many

903
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,200
one and four for a pyramid

904
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,360
and it wants the center of the pyramid

905
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,799
um if i do this method um so if i draw a

906
00:31:58,799 --> 00:31:59,279
line

907
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,320
quickly across there

908
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,159
which is left click for each one and

909
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,360
right click

910
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,600
to complete the command so it's like

911
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,399
left click to

912
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,720
insert the geometry right click to

913
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,840
complete the command

914
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,200
and then right click when i'm not uh

915
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,960
doing anything it's going to repeat the

916
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,799
command so that's repeat the last

917
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,600
command

918
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,039
so i can go that way as well so now i

919
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,880
have the center of this box if i

920
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,240
need it for this pyramid so i'm going to

921
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,360
left click

922
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,919
the pyramid it's once the center we have

923
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,679
the number of sides set to four

924
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,679
here we could change a whole bunch of

925
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,919
other options as well for some other

926
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,360
and we can select that midpoint

927
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,760
and since it wants us to select a corner

928
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,960
and then select the end which is the

929
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,440
height

930
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,279
which i just want to enter 100 so it's

931
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,399
sort of balanced

932
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,600
so now we have a pyramid on top of the

933
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,559
sheep

934
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,039
um i want to talk about these uh snaps

935
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:01,919
now

936
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,880
uh which are the o snaps um if you don't

937
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,399
have snaps on

938
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,000
uh it means that you might think you're

939
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,480
clicking the corner or the top of a

940
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,200
pyramid

941
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,360
but you're actually just one millionth

942
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,120
of an inch to the left

943
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,159
left or you're just slightly off

944
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,159
when i was working in big architecture

945
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,279
firms that had

946
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,320
a lot of younger members of staff um

947
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,840
a lot of them did not have snaps on a

948
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,360
lot of the geometry was

949
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,679
almost perfect but if you zoomed in was

950
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,760
actually all over the place the

951
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,880
the squares weren't perfectly square and

952
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,120
it was really annoying so having snaps

953
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,960
on and having the right snaps on is

954
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,399
really important so there are several

955
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,120
types

956
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,640
and near point mid center intersect

957
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,159
perspective are the big ones after that

958
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,760
they kind of fade off in their relevance

959
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,360
if endpoint is on any type of geometry

960
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,519
will snap to the endpoint of any

961
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,760
geometry if that endpoint is

962
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,279
not selected it will not get there see

963
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:03,760
it says

964
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,360
near which is telling us what snap it's

965
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,679
doing and that would be an example if

966
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,520
i was to start that but that is not

967
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,079
perfectly

968
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,280
on that corner only if end is on will it

969
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,918
snap to an

970
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,320
end point near means it will snap to a

971
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,560
a curve just on the curve but not the

972
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,440
end point

973
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,639
so if that was off now i'm not even

974
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,280
snapping

975
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,440
snapping to the line and just snapping

976
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,399
anywhere in space

977
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,520
near there so my new geometry would be

978
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,239
quite

979
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,719
random so that will snap to a center

980
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,560
point of a pyramid or circle

981
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,839
center zone and midpoint

982
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,040
as well point is

983
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,239
if there are any points in the model or

984
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,399
um yeah just if there's any points in

985
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,760
the model which you kind of create at

986
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,719
times

987
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,920
um if you have two curves and you're

988
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,119
intersecting and want to meet at the

989
00:34:59,119 --> 00:34:59,839
intersection

990
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,880
that's that can be on um and

991
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,240
perpendicular is

992
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,000
useful as well but i believe most of

993
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,400
them on most of the time

994
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,720
and then i'll snap uh down the bottom

995
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,640
will either turn all snaps off or

996
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,000
all snaps on there are times when you

997
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,119
kind of

998
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,440
want to create very organic geometry and

999
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,720
you want snaps to get out of your way

1000
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,920
so um

1001
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,960
if i have this pyramid i can zoom in

1002
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,560
on different views this is the right

1003
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,160
view in the front view

1004
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,359
um mirror is a regular command and in

1005
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:35,920
rhino

1006
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,960
i just type mirror and it works so it

1007
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,800
asks me for the start of

1008
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,960
the mirror reflection and it's going to

1009
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,000
snap to the end

1010
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,359
point and it tells me that it's both an

1011
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,359
end point and an intersection point

1012
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,200
um that's fine i wanted to snap to that

1013
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,280
point and because i have ortho on it's

1014
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,200
only going to go horizontal

1015
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,760
and it's going to mirror the geometry

1016
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,960
creating another pyramid

1017
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,839
exact same size

1018
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,440
if i went from that side it would create

1019
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,839
that way

1020
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,280
so now i have this facing pyramid

1021
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,400
and um

1022
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,119
i can't remember what this uh sculpture

1023
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,400
thing is

1024
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,800
and i'm just gonna create anything but

1025
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,040
um

1026
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,640
[Music]

1027
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,520
so now we can just create other types of

1028
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,079
geometry

1029
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,000
that we can center so let's do a

1030
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,359
cylinder

1031
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,000
uh we don't have a midpoint but we do

1032
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,960
actually

1033
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,640
have a center point that we can snap to

1034
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,920
so you're always kind of looking to get

1035
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,880
a

1036
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,160
center point so left click to begin then

1037
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
ask me for the radius if i get a

1038
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,320
midpoint here i can just snap to that

1039
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,480
and then it asks me for end of cylinder

1040
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,520
which is the height

1041
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,040
and i just got 100

1042
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,320
from matching side

1043
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,960
so i hope you'll be able to follow along

1044
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,119
this video when it gets uploaded or

1045
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,040
um you can't follow along as i'm

1046
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,079
doing this talk but um follow along and

1047
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,400
then

1048
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,560
ask any questions and i'll be available

1049
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,160
to answer questions anytime you want

1050
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,040
during the week

1051
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,079
i have to figure out where we're going

1052
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,640
to ask them

1053
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,280
so now that we have our kind of geometry

1054
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,520
we can orbit around it we can zoom in

1055
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
and out of it

1056
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,839
we want to sort of keep our model

1057
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,400
organized

1058
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,760
so when the software is open by default

1059
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,839
it does not have layers

1060
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,560
and

1061
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,680
layers and properties on

1062
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
so it sort of initially creates them as

1063
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,119
this sort of pop-up menu

1064
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,960
if you sort of drag it and kind of needs

1065
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,720
to be dragged from the left side of it

1066
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,079
it will snap to the um

1067
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,920
left hand side of the screen you may

1068
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,680
need to sort of pull it out by just

1069
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,680
hovering over these lines and left click

1070
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,880
drag

1071
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,280
it to make it wider and you can left

1072
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,200
click drag any of these

1073
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,320
as well just if you wanted

1074
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,800
so everything is on this current layer

1075
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,160
called default

1076
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,440
um this little file here creates new

1077
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,240
layers

1078
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,520
and we can move or create take five new

1079
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,599
layers

1080
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,720
and having layers uh on helps

1081
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,359
sort of put different objects on

1082
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,400
different layers to

1083
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,960
hide them or to lock them so that

1084
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,320
they're not snappable

1085
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,720
if you have thousands of objects in your

1086
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,440
model

1087
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,920
it really helps to be able to just work

1088
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,400
on a tiny part of it at any given time

1089
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,839
and not have uh thousands of polygonal

1090
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,560
points that are all going to

1091
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,359
be snappable because if i have if you

1092
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,400
see if i'm trying to

1093
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,520
even just with a small amount of

1094
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,839
geometry that i'm trying to snap to that

1095
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:52,880
bottom corner

1096
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,480
it's kind of snapping to all these

1097
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,640
points near there so i want as little

1098
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,920
geometry in the model

1099
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
so that my snap goes to the exact point

1100
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,040
i want it to

1101
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,240
because if it goes to the wrong point my

1102
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,280
geometry is going to be all wrong and

1103
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,400
i'm going to have to go back

1104
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,560
and recreate it so

1105
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,800
um left click selects

1106
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,480
any object we want and this

1107
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,119
colorful circle is the layer properties

1108
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,720
so this shows us

1109
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,200
that this all the details of this object

1110
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,880
shows us that this is currently on the

1111
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,079
default layer

1112
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,720
and we can move that to layer one

1113
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,240
and then move this

1114
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,720
bottom pyramid to layer two the top

1115
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,400
pyramid two

1116
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,839
layer three cancel

1117
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,599
clicking this i don't know what this is

1118
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,720
actually meant to be it looks like kind

1119
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,119
of a

1120
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,359
pie with a blue white and red layer a

1121
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,880
slice of pie or something

1122
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,280
um we have the option of the light bulbs

1123
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,880
beside each layer

1124
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,000
and the lock symbol and this black

1125
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,160
square the black square is the color of

1126
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,680
the layer

1127
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,520
and this is just for modeling purposes

1128
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,040
only if

1129
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,280
i render this model it looks red here

1130
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,400
but it's still

1131
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,760
uh not it has no material it does not

1132
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,280
have a red material this is just for

1133
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,480
modeling

1134
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,359
um so if i click the lock layer that

1135
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,920
locks layer one which is our red one

1136
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,040
and if i click a line uh it still will

1137
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,680
snap to that layer but i can select it

1138
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,560
i can't move it i it just sort of stays

1139
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,680
in the background

1140
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,400
and if i turn the light off it

1141
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,240
disappears

1142
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,240
oh it comes back so hiding geometry

1143
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,599
that's still in the model it's not

1144
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,359
deleted is

1145
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,319
one way of focusing on exactly what you

1146
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,280
want

1147
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,960
um and if i click this uh pyramid

1148
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,040
i if i wanted to just work on this or

1149
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,280
select just the two pyramids

1150
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,319
um i would click i could type

1151
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,240
isolate and it isolates

1152
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,800
everything that's not locked but okay so

1153
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,839
isolate again

1154
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,480
and now i just have the other stuff is

1155
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,720
still very much in my 3d model space

1156
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,400
it's just currently disappeared

1157
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,000
control z in rhino has an enormous

1158
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,119
memory it can be

1159
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,240
manually edited in the settings but

1160
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,880
you can click it many many times and it

1161
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,280
will

1162
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,960
undo the hide if we type unhide

1163
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,520
it will unhide all objects

1164
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,560
or show sorry yeah showing three hidden

1165
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,640
objects

1166
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,280
and those menus are this light bulb you

1167
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,400
can see the left

1168
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,079
click is hide the right click is show

1169
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,560
and if i left click and hold it i get

1170
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,800
the menu i can drag that out

1171
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,640
the third one shows selected objects and

1172
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,599
the fourth one is

1173
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,079
isolated isolate object so that that

1174
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:56,960
isolate button

1175
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,960
is this fourth one if we wanted to click

1176
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,640
it

1177
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,040
and then we can just close this and

1178
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,680
close this

1179
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,599
so i'm just going to show all

1180
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:16,560
and let's just

1181
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,690
so um

1182
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:20,900
[Music]

1183
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,160
when um

1184
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,880
when dragging or to move an object and

1185
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,079
to rotate an object

1186
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,119
and to scale an object um they are done

1187
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,160
by just typing in

1188
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,200
move rotate scale um there's always

1189
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,680
multiple ways so they are

1190
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,040
i'm not sure even where they are because

1191
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,960
i never find them in the menus because

1192
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,480
it's a very slow process

1193
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,720
but you can find move rotate scale over

1194
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,240
here it's probably here somewhere as

1195
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,359
well but

1196
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,720
um if i

1197
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,079
if i left click an object and type move

1198
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,000
and then it says point where do i want

1199
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,280
to move it from and i like

1200
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,319
left click this bottom corner and point

1201
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,520
i want to move it to and i

1202
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,680
left click this other corner it will

1203
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,200
precisely move it

1204
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,640
by that distance

1205
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,520
if i was to have it selected and type

1206
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,200
move

1207
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,520
and select the point to move from and

1208
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,319
then type it

1209
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,520
distance but i'm just going to like hold

1210
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,560
or kind of move it either slightly along

1211
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,240
the x or slightly along the y and as

1212
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,680
long as it's sort of in that direction

1213
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,440
and then type 100

1214
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,280
and sort of set in that direction and

1215
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,040
type enter

1216
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,400
uh it's sort of locked there and

1217
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,880
one left click to finish and it's done

1218
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,040
so that's one another way of doing it

1219
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,560
in rhino and i just want to sort of make

1220
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,800
this point that in many cases it doesn't

1221
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,240
matter what order you do things which

1222
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,920
makes the software really nice to use

1223
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,880
because

1224
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,160
um some softwares that are order

1225
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,119
specific

1226
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,480
don't work when you try to get them to

1227
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,640
do it so if i was to type move

1228
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,240
without having anything selected it

1229
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,079
would then just ask me on the top left

1230
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,400
corner select objects to move

1231
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,920
then i select the object and i press

1232
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,599
enter and then i'm back to the point

1233
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,359
that i move it on from so

1234
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,880
you can have the object selected first

1235
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,560
or you can select it later it really

1236
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,440
doesn't matter

1237
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,880
but you're always looking to this top

1238
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,359
left menu for what kind of instructions

1239
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:17,920
does it

1240
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,839
does the software want me to do

1241
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,240
so um i normally i haven't done online

1242
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,599
teaching before but i've normally sort

1243
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:30,480
of

1244
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,560
set these tasks for you to do and then

1245
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,079
see how you're doing and then just add

1246
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,200
more

1247
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,640
tools later but we're just going to

1248
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,960
cover a few more tools

1249
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,839
for the last 10 minutes so if you want

1250
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,280
to know the distance of something

1251
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,160
type distance and that will work also

1252
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,359
kind of like

1253
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,599
google's prediction when you type a

1254
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,280
search thing if you

1255
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,599
just type a few letters it will show you

1256
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,560
every command

1257
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,720
in rhino that it thinks you're trying to

1258
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,000
find and

1259
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,760
sometimes if you kind of half remember a

1260
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,040
command

1261
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,560
you can kind of just type a few letters

1262
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,119
and see what's available

1263
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,079
also so if we type distance

1264
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,720
type the first point and then type the

1265
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,200
second point

1266
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,040
it says that distance is 100 millimeters

1267
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,400
which everything i'm doing right now

1268
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,000
is 100 millimeters because i use this uh

1269
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,599
top area a lot

1270
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,000
i'd usually drag this down so i can see

1271
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,319
more of it this is the history of

1272
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,000
everything i've done so i can just

1273
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,560
sort of see the last few commands and

1274
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,760
there's a

1275
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,280
scroll thing here so i can actually

1276
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,880
scroll up the full history of every

1277
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,520
single

1278
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,599
thing that i've done it does remember a

1279
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:44,880
lot of history

1280
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,880
uh again that can be manually edited in

1281
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,280
settings

1282
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,640
so um you can kind of see on this left

1283
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,079
hand menu

1284
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,560
the curves different types of curves and

1285
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,480
different types of surfaces

1286
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,680
and different types of solids

1287
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,000
and then join and explode so if i type

1288
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,560
explode to a poly surface that would

1289
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,000
turn it into

1290
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,599
all of the surfaces that made it up so

1291
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:14,000
you can see

1292
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,599
that that is now

1293
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,839
all these different surfaces and

1294
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:20,960
selecting them

1295
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,079
if i'm selecting multiple objects from a

1296
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:24,800
distance

1297
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,520
it gives me a pop-up menu for the

1298
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,560
different surfaces and if they were

1299
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,240
surfaces curves it would say surface

1300
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:30,800
curve

1301
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,400
point whatever and if there were

1302
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,920
different layers it would show

1303
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,599
what layer they're on it kind of makes

1304
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,200
it slightly easier to select but if

1305
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,400
you're too much geometry it's near

1306
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,280
impossible

1307
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,880
but it does add um and how much it helps

1308
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,000
you sort of select this

1309
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,280
and then if i select them all again um

1310
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,720
and type join

1311
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,880
it join surfaces and makes them back

1312
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,839
into

1313
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,839
polysurface

1314
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,000
and then since we're going to do move

1315
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,040
rotate and scale

1316
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,560
rotate and make sure your rotate and not

1317
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,280
rotate 3d i'll show you both but

1318
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,480
rotate is a sort of flat rotation if i

1319
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,040
set a point

1320
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,720
in the top menu and you kind of see that

1321
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,480
if if i select any point

1322
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,920
it's going to select that point in all

1323
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,599
the views so

1324
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,119
that top top of the cube the selected

1325
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:29,760
cube

1326
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,400
point in perspective it's selected in

1327
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,440
the top view

1328
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,040
but i wouldn't know if it's that point

1329
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,400
from that point so you kind of need to

1330
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,319
look at multiple views to see

1331
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,880
which point is being selected and that's

1332
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,839
why snaps and

1333
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,200
everything is important selecting the

1334
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,780
right points um

1335
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,400
[Music]

1336
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,319
so if i want to rotate around the origin

1337
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,000
point i can select this bottom corner

1338
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,920
because that's the origin point uh and

1339
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,760
then i just need to left click it's

1340
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,920
asking for the sort of first reference

1341
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,119
point

1342
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,280
and then it's going to ask me the second

1343
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,200
breakfast point and it's going to rotate

1344
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,800
90 degrees uh again if i left click

1345
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,280
the first corner and i sort of set the

1346
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,920
second corner and then i just type

1347
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,520
30 it would go 30 degrees

1348
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,119
and i don't make some very accurate

1349
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,160
rotations that way

1350
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,440
rotate 3d um is going to have an

1351
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,000
extra step in it so it wants to select

1352
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
the object to rotate

1353
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
i left like the object and i press enter

1354
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,359
when done

1355
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,760
the rotational axis and this time in

1356
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,520
this case i'm going to select

1357
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,119
this line here as the rotational axis

1358
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,520
then the first reference point i'm going

1359
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,200
to select

1360
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,920
this point here and now it's going that

1361
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,119
way around

1362
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,240
so i can um and if i'm

1363
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,520
selecting very um

1364
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,960
obscure accesses i can sort of rotate um

1365
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,960
beyond the orthogonal geometry but

1366
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,160
that would be that one and ctrl c will

1367
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,799
undo that

1368
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,480
duplicate is another

1369
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,440
important command so dup is the

1370
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,960
shorthand for duplicate

1371
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,640
and duplicate edge is the command of how

1372
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,440
i would go

1373
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,920
from a surface back to a curve so

1374
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,920
that just selects that one curve and if

1375
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,280
i press enter

1376
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,319
and then i move it out

1377
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,480
you can see that that's now the curve

1378
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,599
and then if sel is the other used one

1379
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,960
i'm going to give you guys

1380
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,200
uh um grammar uh or vocabulary

1381
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,880
a sheet that has all of these shorthands

1382
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,240
for these commands

1383
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,680
um so it's just just i mean there's not

1384
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,960
that many when you get used to them

1385
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,870
just duplicate select explode join

1386
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,760
[Music]

1387
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,240
so on so you can select all objects with

1388
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,119
scl

1389
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,599
all you could select just the curves in

1390
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:08,240
the model by

1391
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,839
select sel crv um

1392
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,520
just the curves in the model and if i

1393
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,800
had the curves and i didn't want them i

1394
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,200
could do

1395
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,760
sel crv and then delete which i'm going

1396
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,160
to do because

1397
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,920
so that is um most of what i want to

1398
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,400
cover today

1399
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:30,770
um

1400
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:33,969
[Music]

1401
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,079
one other just little trick that's kind

1402
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,400
of important is if i am moving

1403
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,760
stuff um

1404
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,640
you can't just left click and drag but

1405
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,280
this is a sort of inaccurate drag that

1406
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,160
now

1407
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,640
i've nowhere to reference that to say

1408
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,800
it's precisely on the origin point or a

1409
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,319
hundred millimeters north point it's

1410
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,040
just

1411
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,720
a random distance now because i just

1412
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,160
dragged it but

1413
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,000
if i was to do move

1414
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,839
uh which i can type m enter or move

1415
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,000
enter

1416
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,559
and i select this bottom corner point

1417
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,079
and then once the point that i can move

1418
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,680
to

1419
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,920
but i control click on any point

1420
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,599
that's not going to select the final

1421
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,359
point it's going to select

1422
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,599
that point in 3d and then lock it to

1423
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:24,880
that vertical axis

1424
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,000
and then i can type a height above that

1425
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,480
point

1426
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,640
so that's sort of move

1427
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,240
select object bottom corner

1428
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,079
and then control click this bottom

1429
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,400
corner

1430
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,359
so left click control and then okay

1431
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,680
that's locked and then i could type 50

1432
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,520
and it would be exactly 50 meters

1433
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,160
50 ml for whatever my units are um

1434
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,480
so the aim of this lecture is really

1435
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,839
just to create the shape

1436
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,000
in

1437
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,720
something delete that copy

1438
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,598
enter and

1439
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,440
drag that one up and then left click

1440
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:27,920
copy

1441
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,440
enter okay

1442
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,839
and lastly we haven't created a sphere

1443
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,680
but we can sort of left click

1444
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,040
drop out this menu and say

1445
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,359
sphere no one wants to know the center

1446
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,280
of the sphere

1447
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,800
and this is where this control click i

1448
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,559
don't know if this is too complicated

1449
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:47,359
too early but

1450
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,839
if i control click on top of this uh

1451
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,520
pyramid

1452
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,800
now i'm locked that distance and it's

1453
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,520
asking me

1454
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,119
for i think it's going to ask me for the

1455
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,599
radius so if i want a 100 millimeter on

1456
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,800
the diameter

1457
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,160
i'm going to do 50

1458
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:15,839
and once the radius is

1459
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,119
that's mainly just what we want to cover

1460
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,359
today

1461
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,760
a lot of these tools as i repeat them

1462
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,800
throughout the

1463
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,559
various weeks will become obvious the

1464
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,079
idea of layers

1465
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,119
snaps turning the snaps on at the bottom

1466
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,079
corner here

1467
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,599
and just creating geometry and putting

1468
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,839
in the model um the left click and the

1469
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:44,800
right clicking

1470
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,480
of rhino just takes a while to get used

1471
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,920
to it but just

1472
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,680
um left click is to sort of create

1473
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,440
geometry right click is to sort out

1474
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,480
finish command to to orbit um

1475
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,400
it sort of depends what you're doing

1476
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,720
what the left and right clicking

1477
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,359
is at that time but hopefully you'll be

1478
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:02,480
able to follow this video

1479
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:09,119
and draw that gentleman
