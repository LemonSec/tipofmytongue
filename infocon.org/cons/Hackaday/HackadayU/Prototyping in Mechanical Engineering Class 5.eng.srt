2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,400
hey everyone

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,040
uh welcome back week five the final week

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,559
right here prototyping mechanical

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,040
engineering i am will fisher and i

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,760
am your guide through the world of

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,279
mechanical engineering here

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,439
um today we're going to be talking about

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,439
uh motion and gears and

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,519
moving stuff and all that sort of thing

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,039
uh which should be really fun i just

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,880
want to remind everyone before we hop

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,558
in um that there are some quizzes and so

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,960
you if you if you wish to take them i

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,399
believe hackaday will give you like a

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,000
certification that you've completed the

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,559
course

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,399
if you can pass those quizzes i realize

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,840
given how quickly we move through all

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,440
this material it may be helpful to go

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,200
and watch youtube uh of the these

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,640
classes afterwards so you can kind of

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,960
get everything um

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,440
but uh but those you can get that

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,640
certification going

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,160
so um without further ado uh we're gonna

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,359
jump right on in just

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,199
uh to introduce myself again my name is

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,800
will fisher i am

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,559
a mechanical engineer i've been doing

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,560
engineering for more than a decade now

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,400
in a variety of different fields

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,760
i'm a freelancer so if you have a

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
project you can hire me um

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,000
and i also teach so i can do that as

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,119
well

37
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,439
uh let's jump in it's movie break time

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,560
because we're only

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,280
a bit in uh this one i like a lot

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
hopefully i've got my audio shared so i

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,600
want to make sure that i've got my

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,720
audio shared on this

43
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,439
um yeah sorry i was not sharing computer

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,119
sound

45
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,040
because this one is a beautiful thing

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,320
the missile knows where it is at all

47
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,280
times

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
it knows this because it knows where it

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,240
isn't by subtracting where it is from

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,119
where it isn't

51
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,200
or where it isn't from where it is

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,640
whichever is greater

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,920
it obtains a difference or deviation

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,399
okay

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
so i have this in there because i think

56
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,840
it's really funny um

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,799
and uh i just figure um it's a good way

58
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,159
to think about motion you know

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,280
and a lot of times you're thinking about

60
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,719
where you are but sometimes you think

61
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,600
about where you're not

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,280
and how to get there and it's an

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,959
interesting frame of reference to use i

64
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:09,919
mean this is clearly

65
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,160
kind of comical uh comical ish um

66
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,680
uh but it's good to have that kind of

67
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
reference so we'll move right on in

68
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,160
to a motion and then after that we'll

69
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,520
look at power transmission and what i

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,440
mean by that is how you get power from

71
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,560
one thing to another

72
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,280
like a motor into a propeller something

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,080
like that

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,000
um then we'll talk about linear

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
actuation so that's

76
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,599
the kind of where your power comes from

77
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,360
and rotary actuation as well so that's

78
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,879
stuff moving in a line as compared to

79
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,959
stuff rotating around

80
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,879
um cool let's go into the intro stuff

81
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,879
today is going to be um pretty heavy on

82
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,239
math but it's all

83
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,800
algebra um and so it will be difficult

84
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,319
math just a lot of it

85
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,080
um so we'll jump in on that um

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,319
first of all i want to define motion

87
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,280
motion is just

88
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,319
stuff with mass and that's important

89
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,159
moving from one place to another and

90
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:00,640
mass

91
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,519
uh follows newton's laws specifically

92
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,319
inertia

93
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,760
um and that is a body at rest will stay

94
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,720
at rest unless

95
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,480
acted upon otherwise and a body in

96
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,159
motion will stay in motion unless acted

97
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,280
upon otherwise and

98
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,200
that's a pretty important thing that uh

99
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,720
that inertia is kind of the

100
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,760
mechanical and physical space equivalent

101
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,080
of

102
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,159
induction in the electrical world and

103
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,680
it's just this idea that once you're

104
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,200
doing something it's going to stay doing

105
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
that thing whether it's still

106
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,519
or motion the second one is one newton's

107
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,879
second law is one we're going to spend a

108
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,159
lot of time with today

109
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,400
and that is uh force is equal to the

110
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,159
mass times the acceleration

111
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,080
um and so that you can play either

112
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,360
direction you can either start with an

113
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,959
acceleration of mass and figure out how

114
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,920
much force went in

115
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,440
or you start with a force and play it

116
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,720
the other direction we'll spend a lot

117
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,040
more time there um and the final one is

118
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,200
every action has an equal but opposing

119
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,640
reaction so example

120
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,720
for example you exert a force on the

121
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,840
floor uh

122
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,319
assuming you're on a floor um and it

123
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,840
exerts an equal force

124
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
back up in the other direction and in

125
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,439
the case that those

126
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,120
forces were not equal there would be

127
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,959
motion that f equals m a

128
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,040
so so that's an important way to think

129
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,319
about things though the map we're

130
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,080
working on today won't go too far

131
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,439
into that um and

132
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,760
today's class will be a warming blend of

133
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,279
practical and theoretical a lot of

134
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,399
theoretical is going to be the

135
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,320
mathematical side of things

136
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,360
um and as we jump in i do want to take a

137
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
quick note here of this

138
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,960
image over here on the right side that's

139
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
what we mechanical engineers call a free

140
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
body diagram

141
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,759
and that's where you take something by

142
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,600
the center of mass so here you have

143
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,639
a block on a inclined plane with pulley

144
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,040
and so these are the two masses that you

145
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
see and you can look at all of the

146
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,040
different forces that are at play here

147
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,840
and how they

148
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
how they balance out and that's a really

149
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,199
important way to think about

150
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,880
uh whether or not stuff is going to move

151
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,639
around on you and so you'll see those a

152
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,600
couple of times

153
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,520
further on in the presentation but just

154
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,960
give you an idea of what it is you're

155
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,000
looking at that's what those

156
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,360
are okay newton's second law like i said

157
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,240
we're going to get

158
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
right into the depth of this so it's

159
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,039
that force equals mass times

160
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,080
acceleration

161
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,360
um acceleration is uh the

162
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,000
the movement of something increasing in

163
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,960
speed

164
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,680
um so you have distance and then

165
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,720
distance per time

166
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
is rate or velocity if it has a

167
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,000
direction to it and

168
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,639
velocity per time is acceleration so

169
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,280
it's the

170
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,639
second time derivative of the position

171
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,160
mass is the material that is a property

172
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,479
that

173
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,720
all material has which is it weighs

174
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,520
something and

175
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,600
by in this case its weight is the force

176
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,639
of gravity on it i'll

177
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,800
talk about that a little bit more in a

178
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,720
second just to kind of clarify i realize

179
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,440
a lot of these

180
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,560
things kind of uh get confused

181
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,960
anyway so what we look at the unit of

182
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,440
force in in the si world is the newton

183
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
it's abbreviated n um and that's a

184
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,160
kilogram uh times a meter per second

185
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,039
squared

186
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,280
and that's just a very standard unit and

187
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,800
we're going to look at units as a way of

188
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,639
explaining phenomena and that kind of

189
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,319
helps us all

190
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,240
get get through it um

191
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,319
so um torque is uh

192
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,160
with the same exact principle but taken

193
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,000
into a rotational frame so we as

194
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,199
mechanical engineers

195
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,600
oftentimes things spin and find things

196
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,120
spinning around and so

197
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
it's helpful to just multiply that stuff

198
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,360
by the radius it is away

199
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,600
so and that happens for angular velocity

200
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,400
as well

201
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,880
um and it turns out that that radius

202
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
component drops away but if it doesn't

203
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,479
drop away you have different forces

204
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,400
acting at different radiuses away from a

205
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,280
thing

206
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,759
then that's a really important thing to

207
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,199
calculate in the way that you rotate

208
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,880
something so a torque very close to the

209
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,600
shaft

210
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,080
um can be counteracted by a relatively

211
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,919
minor force far away from the shaft

212
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,560
of large torque i'm not going to talk

213
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,600
too much about

214
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,680
torque and the rotational frame simply

215
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
because we just don't have time for that

216
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,560
so i'm going to do everything pretty

217
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,039
much in a linear and translational thing

218
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,919
frame and you can extrapolate that to

219
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,960
your rotational frame on your own

220
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
work is an important component of this

221
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,960
as well and that's the product of force

222
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,800
which is mass times acceleration

223
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
times the distance over which it

224
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
operates and so um

225
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
normally this would be you would get

226
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
into the calculus of this and it would

227
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,960
be integrated over the distance

228
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,240
but in the case of something that is

229
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,919
constant the integration comes out to

230
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,360
just be multiplication which is really

231
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,639
convenient for us so we're not going to

232
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,479
do anything more complicated than that

233
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,680
we'll just give you an idea of what's

234
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,000
deeper under the hood here

235
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,280
um and that unit is a joule a joule is a

236
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,360
newton times a meter

237
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,560
and so um oddly enough

238
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
that newton times the meter is the same

239
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,080
as you would get from a

240
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,000
torque over here which is also a newton

241
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,120
meter

242
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,440
but in the case of work you're thinking

243
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,800
about it the force

244
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,639
operating over that entire thing so so

245
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
while they look like the same unit they

246
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,879
are in fact

247
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,800
not the same unit so here you have

248
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
you've added that meter into the top so

249
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,759
if you look closely there you'll see

250
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,280
that i've squared my m

251
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,759
so it's kilogram times a meter squared

252
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,360
per second squared

253
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,400
cool moving right along

254
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,520
energy is in the same units

255
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,160
as work in joules and it can be used to

256
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
do work though it isn't necessarily

257
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,800
the same thing because it can be a lot

258
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,160
of different things

259
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
energy can also measure losses to heat

260
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,400
and it is always conserved and what that

261
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,800
is

262
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,440
is that in a system that you have the

263
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,199
amount of energy that goes into it will

264
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,000
always come out

265
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,280
in some form eventually um

266
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,000
and so that's a really important thing

267
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,440
but if you think about

268
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,479
uh about this if i'm doing work i'm

269
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,360
putting some work

270
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
in maybe it's electrical energy and it's

271
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
coming out as rotational energy there

272
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,080
will always be

273
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,519
some loss there towards you nothing has

274
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,600
what we call perfect efficiency so

275
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,360
efficiency is down there at the bottom

276
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,160
efficiency

277
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,680
is commonly used with that kind of loopy

278
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,160
end

279
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,600
shape which is cool and that is

280
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,480
a ratio of the useful energy out from

281
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,000
your system so whether that's you're

282
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
compressing a spring or

283
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,959
you've rotated the thing a certain

284
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,480
number of revolutions or something

285
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,920
divided by that energy and so it's

286
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,200
always going to be a number

287
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,279
between zero and one it'll never be

288
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,240
above one

289
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,720
if it is come find me we got patents to

290
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,519
file

291
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,080
um but if it's if it's not it should be

292
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,000
in that range now it can get very very

293
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
very close to one

294
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,880
and sometimes you find things when

295
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
something is quote

296
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,800
ideal then you just assume it has an

297
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
energy

298
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,519
an efficiency of one but in reality

299
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,360
nothing has perfect efficiency because

300
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,720
reality is

301
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,000
not what theory tells it it should be

302
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,760
okay so let's think about uh

303
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,240
what we've got to to calculate here so

304
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,120
there's a lot of different types of

305
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,760
energy do i

306
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,720
skip a slide somehow no i guess not

307
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,920
there are there are several different

308
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,040
types of

309
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,160
uh energy here um the first is that

310
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,279
we're going to talk about is kinetic

311
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,880
energy and so that is

312
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,440
uh like how how much energy you have in

313
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,360
a moving object so if you have a car

314
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,279
moving at a specific speed

315
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,240
the the kinetic energy in the car is

316
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,320
modeled as one-half times the mass of

317
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,200
the car

318
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,279
times the square of the velocity of the

319
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,040
car

320
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,279
if you have that car go off an ideal

321
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,519
ramp a perfectly efficient ramp

322
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,160
goes straight up it will you can guess

323
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,200
the height of it

324
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,839
based on the mass times the acceleration

325
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,200
of gravity times the height that's

326
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,640
potential energy

327
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,480
gravitational potential energy it's

328
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,399
going to then fall right back down and

329
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,000
assuming it hits its ramp

330
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,519
and there's no friction it will end up

331
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,720
going the other direction at the same

332
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,480
speed which is kind of a comical thing

333
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,440
uh we call this the roadrunner effect um

334
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,560
but that is actually

335
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,079
and you can calculate the height it goes

336
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,680
up to and you know that it was it comes

337
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,200
back down assuming that everything comes

338
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,399
back down the right way

339
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,920
and there's no friction in the system so

340
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,240
no energy lost heat

341
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,000
um then it will end up moving back out

342
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
of the ramp at the same velocity that

343
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,320
came

344
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,600
into the ramp wild okay that's the

345
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,440
conservation of energy at work

346
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,200
you can also store potential energy in a

347
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,720
whole bunch of other different ways

348
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
for example uh mechanical energy can be

349
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,000
stored in springs

350
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,519
so you can press compress compress

351
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,120
compress compress and then

352
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,079
when it releases it can create this fast

353
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,279
moving

354
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,440
object uh so that would be something

355
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,959
like if you have a spring-loaded

356
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,920
catapult

357
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,600
or like a trebuchet uses the

358
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
gravitational potential energy

359
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,120
counterbalances it and then it converts

360
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,959
all that pretty efficiently into

361
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,880
velocity of a much smaller

362
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,560
mass which is cool that's how it can

363
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,240
launch so far um

364
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,279
you can do the same thing with like um

365
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,959
like a bow and arrow you have this kind

366
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,399
of spring potential

367
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,839
as you draw it and then as you release

368
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,519
it out it goes

369
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,560
into that kinetic energy so this can be

370
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,240
a really convenient way to calculate

371
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
stuff

372
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,240
um there's other convey potential energy

373
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
stored in other places

374
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,040
the potential energy inside of a bullet

375
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
is stored chemically

376
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,880
for instance and then it explodes and

377
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,959
that creates a large amount of energy

378
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,360
which then you convert through to be

379
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,519
kinetic energy in the case of a firearm

380
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,680
and there's other ways out there as well

381
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,040
i won't get into

382
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
so let's take a look at an example here

383
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,240
so let's say we've got a spring we're

384
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,639
going to

385
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,560
crank it all the way down we're going to

386
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,320
put a mass on top of it

387
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
and then we're going to release it and

388
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
we're going to see how high our mass

389
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,240
goes

390
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
okay so throughout this entire thing

391
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,079
we're going to assume

392
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,680
that everything is operating with

393
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
perfect efficiency so that we can serve

394
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,800
energy throughout the entire

395
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,720
uh the entire entire

396
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,040
example so we're going to start with our

397
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,720
potential energy from a spring

398
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,079
that k is a spring constant and you can

399
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,760
that is a listed property when you

400
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
purchase a spring it'll tell you

401
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,519
the spring constant um so we're just

402
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,519
going to choose i chose here arbitrarily

403
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,360
a spring constant of 12.

404
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,480
um and then we're going to see what

405
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
happens as it just goes through

406
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,560
the system um so we have this thing

407
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,760
we're going to see what happens if we

408
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,519
put a one kilo object

409
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,600
on top of this spring that we've now

410
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,839
compressed half of a meter

411
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,120
um and then we're going to see how high

412
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,200
it goes when it comes out the top so you

413
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,720
can see there that i've taken this

414
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,560
this value here um 12 times

415
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,839
point point five squared so that's uh

416
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,440
what 1.5

417
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,760
joules is my unit here and then

418
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,000
i'm going to see what 1.5 joules of

419
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,680
energy will do in terms of the launch

420
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,200
velocity that is the velocity that's

421
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,480
moving right as it leaves the spring

422
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,680
and then i'm going to convert that

423
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,760
velocity into height i could convert

424
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,040
straight from the spring energy to

425
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,720
height but i'm curious to know how fast

426
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,760
my object

427
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,360
is leaving uh the thing so it turns out

428
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
to be the square root of three so if we

429
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
if we multiply that two on through

430
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,199
that's uh and then we

431
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,800
take the square root so our velocity is

432
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,240
the square root of three which is about

433
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,160
1.73 meters per second

434
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,360
which is pretty quick when you think

435
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,839
about that that's fast

436
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,839
um so we want to see how high this one

437
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,079
kilo mass is going to go

438
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,160
so the gravitation uh like the

439
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,600
acceleration of gravity

440
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,199
at sea level on earth is 9.81 meters per

441
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,360
second squared that's just how it is

442
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,490
you can look that up in a table um

443
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,720
[Music]

444
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,440
but uh but then we can figure out our

445
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,880
height so we now have an object that's

446
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,440
moving

447
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,839
that we know has 1.5 joules it's moving

448
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,240
at 1.73 meters per second

449
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,880
so we divide that 1.5 joules by our

450
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,320
acceleration

451
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,560
to get our height which is 0.15 meters

452
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,839
so this thing's pretty heavy so it's not

453
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,880
actually going to go all that high it's

454
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,000
going to launch really fast and then

455
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,959
it's going to

456
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,959
kind of ground right back into the earth

457
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,800
there

458
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,839
cool so

459
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,880
moving along power is kind of the next

460
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,680
thing

461
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,279
here that we want to that we want to

462
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,959
look at

463
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,880
and so power is what happens when you

464
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
look at work over a period of time

465
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
and so when i say over a period of time

466
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,079
um

467
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,000
i'm dividing by my time so it's an

468
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,079
average amount of power

469
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,880
it's an of work per time and you would

470
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,320
do this with calculus normally just like

471
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
the other things

472
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,639
but we're not getting into that today so

473
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,560
the unit of power is the watt named

474
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,639
after james watt who refined the steam

475
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,160
engine into a usable form and

476
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,760
spurred the industrial revolution

477
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
interesting dude look him up

478
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,079
and it's a joule per second so what that

479
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,440
means is we now have

480
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,680
kilograms times meters squared over

481
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
seconds to the third

482
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,160
and uh that is kind of a useful measure

483
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,560
for us

484
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,720
uh in terms of measuring the amount of

485
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
power in a system over a long period of

486
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,600
time

487
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,680
um we'll come back to that i think i

488
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,959
should have reviewed my slides a little

489
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,120
more closely this afternoon

490
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,360
um so gravity is an acceleration

491
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,720
it's not it's it creates a force based

492
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,839
on the mass

493
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,759
um and the gravity at sea level is this

494
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,240
9.81 meters per second squared

495
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,480
so the force of gravity is that 9.81

496
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,399
times our mass that's why heavy object

497
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,839
applies more force if i put a feather on

498
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,759
my finger it doesn't weigh much

499
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,399
um so the weight the force that it

500
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,000
creates is not very high but if i

501
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
increase that mass

502
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,480
to a 20 kilo boat anchor

503
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,079
then it's going to create quite a lot of

504
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,199
force on my hand also

505
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,079
so we can look at the work done to raise

506
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,440
that

507
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,759
a 10 kilo object one meter so we

508
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,199
multiply that out

509
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,639
the work of gravity is 9.81

510
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,680
that acceleration we had times

511
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,040
the 10 kilo weight

512
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,440
times 1 which is our 1 meter and that's

513
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,600
98.1 joules so that gives you an idea of

514
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,880
how much power

515
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,560
there and let's say we wanted to raise

516
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,639
that in 30 seconds we're now going to

517
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,279
take that 98.1 joules

518
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,839
and divide it by our 30 seconds and that

519
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,120
would require

520
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,320
uh 3.27 watts and you think that's not

521
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,079
very much and it doesn't sound like much

522
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:48,560
but

523
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,800
a 10 kilo object is pretty heavy 30

524
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
seconds is a long time

525
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,360
like i've spent less than 30 seconds so

526
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,720
far on this slide

527
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,480
it is creeping up there right so

528
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,839
so you can use a relatively small motor

529
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,839
to move a lot of weight

530
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,919
um potentially and that's why i'm

531
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,439
talking about this stuff now is when we

532
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,280
think about how we size our motors later

533
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,760
on

534
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,039
we'll want to think about that in terms

535
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,280
of watts and so you want to figure out

536
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,439
the job you have to do and then spec

537
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,720
your motor accordingly

538
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,839
so that's why we're talking about all

539
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,480
this math now

540
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,199
okay so let's check and do a sanity

541
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,119
check on this and see if our units make

542
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,720
sense

543
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
so we have all of these things we're

544
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,000
going to take a look at the units so

545
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,120
we have uh we can take our 9.81 meters

546
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,080
per second squared

547
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,559
kilogram our meter our second we could

548
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,480
we can take all of our numbers out

549
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,080
and we can say okay so there's a meters

550
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,880
per meter squared kilograms and seconds

551
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,000
cubed here oh look our there's our watts

552
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,679
out there at the end kilogram meters

553
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,600
squared per second cubed

554
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,799
voila we have our watts right there

555
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,799
beautiful that's a nice way to check and

556
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,480
make sure all your units are working out

557
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,840
um to make sure you haven't accidentally

558
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
multiplied by 10 use centimeters instead

559
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,280
of meters so on and so forth

560
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,960
this is a really convenient way to make

561
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,280
sure you're doing it right

562
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,760
power comes with trade-offs as always um

563
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,679
as we know from our formula

564
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,720
um we have this kind of

565
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
this divisor in the middle so we can

566
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,320
start with a medium amount of power

567
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,600
and do a medium amount of work in a

568
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,840
medium amount of time if we want to do a

569
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,960
lot more work

570
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,039
we can increase the amount of time the

571
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,240
same amount

572
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,360
so we can spend five watts to do you

573
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,679
know

574
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,880
five joules in one second or

575
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,120
we can do 50 joules in 10 seconds we

576
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,400
just the same

577
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,760
amount of power going in

578
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,600
is used over a longer duration to do

579
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,679
more work same thing goes exactly in the

580
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,280
other direction that's that third line

581
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,679
there

582
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,440
we want to do a little tiny bit of work

583
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,720
in a little tiny time

584
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,039
we can do the same thing but if we want

585
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,039
to do if we want to decrease the time in

586
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,960
which it takes us to do our

587
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,840
work without reducing the amount of work

588
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,640
we do we have to

589
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,000
increase our power and the same thing

590
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
goes the other direction right this kind

591
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,880
of makes sense

592
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,320
uh intuitively but the nice thing is

593
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
there's a mathematical relationship here

594
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
that allows us to model it and it's it's

595
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,520
relatively easy to

596
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,440
to use moving along to something else

597
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,600
okay so i realize i am moving through

598
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,280
this material really quickly and that's

599
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,039
because i want to get to

600
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,120
uh some of the really exciting stuff in

601
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,840
the power transmission parts

602
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,760
stability and control this is a

603
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
trade-off also we'll talk about that in

604
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,880
a slide or two

605
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,840
and i want to say you know you use

606
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,280
control systems to

607
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,679
to move things where you want them to be

608
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,440
stability is the tendency to stay where

609
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,559
you are

610
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,000
it works a lot like inertia right um

611
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,559
if you want something to fly straight

612
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,400
you want it to be pretty stable so

613
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,200
like in big cargo aircraft they put the

614
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
fuselage below the wings and then the

615
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,679
weight

616
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,000
the force of weight keeps that plane

617
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,400
very steady as it's flying

618
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,679
you don't want that for a fighter

619
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,960
because you want to be able to move very

620
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,919
quickly those cargo

621
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,760
planes don't roll over very quickly and

622
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,000
they certainly don't bank very quickly

623
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,480
so with a fighter you you put everything

624
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
pretty close to the center of mass

625
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,120
so that you can rotate and and pitch

626
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,200
really quickly

627
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,880
the result of that is that you have very

628
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,200
good control but very low stability

629
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,679
um and in fact these are f-18s shown

630
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,240
here

631
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,640
when they initially rolled these out the

632
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,919
pilots would get unnerved because

633
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,360
there's an electronic control system

634
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,559
that would control the

635
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,080
ailerons the flaps on the back of the

636
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,240
planes and they would look outside at

637
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,440
certain speeds and they would be

638
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,559
fluttering in the wind and it wasn't

639
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,679
actually that they were fluttering is

640
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,360
that the computer control system was

641
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,840
moving them to maintain that stability

642
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,520
artificially

643
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,640
even on a straight flight so that they

644
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,240
could have that really high level of

645
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,679
control later on when they need to be

646
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,159
doing

647
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,760
extremely uh nimble acro aerobatics

648
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,960
as they're as they're called um and just

649
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,640
uh kind of as you think about this you

650
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,280
can think about the as a pendulum right

651
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
um if i want to be able to move that

652
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
pendulum with a motor

653
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,720
i can shorten my length or lower my mass

654
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,159
and i can move it more quickly but the

655
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,679
thing is it's then much stable if the

656
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,120
wind comes along it'll blow that much

657
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,400
more easily than it would

658
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
if i have a big weight on the end

659
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,280
cool so here's the same thing you can

660
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,840
think about

661
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
and control instability that we talked

662
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,400
about earlier kind of with power

663
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,919
if you want to increase your stability

664
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,600
you're going to by default for the same

665
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,360
amount of power decrease your control

666
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,120
so these are inversely correlated um

667
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,480
and so same thing goes the other

668
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,880
direction or you can crank up your power

669
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,559
get a lot of stability and the same

670
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,559
amount of control or a lot of control

671
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,880
the same amount of stability right it's

672
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,080
all kind of

673
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,480
intuitively makes sense i hope now

674
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,799
cool let's take a look at some control

675
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,480
systems here

676
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,159
uh we'll move along here this is a

677
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,400
control system uh that has one of the

678
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,960
classic

679
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,200
things called an inverted pendulum so

680
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,960
we're going to watch it here

681
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,880
as it moves it's going to try and swing

682
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,400
the pendulum up to the upright position

683
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,919
just by moving back and forth

684
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,919
this is really hard to do as a human

685
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,200
look at that ah

686
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,559
so nice but that

687
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,080
that pivot that you see is actually a

688
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,480
free pivot and that's one of the classic

689
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,159
problems of control systems is how

690
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,080
efficiently can you do this thing

691
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,280
turns out that's a really difficult

692
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,600
mathematical question we're not gonna

693
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,280
um we're not gonna get to it but it

694
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,960
requires uh

695
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,640
some knowledge about control systems i'm

696
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,159
just going to touch briefly on this

697
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,840
and this is one of those slides that's

698
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,760
like an entire phd

699
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,520
entire phds are done this is an entire

700
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
field control theory is an entire field

701
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,520
that people spend their lives

702
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
researching and i'm doing it in a slide

703
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,200
so i'm sorry to those people who do that

704
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
stuff because you are working real hard

705
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
so this is uh hopefully an answer to the

706
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,559
fundamental question of how do i get

707
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,799
something to where i want it to be and

708
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,159
this is a fundamental

709
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,559
part of robotics also because as you try

710
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,080
to have an arm grab a thing

711
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,440
you need to know where the arm is and

712
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,080
you want to get to that location

713
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,799
and so you you can do this one of two

714
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,200
ways

715
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,960
if you don't have information about your

716
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,880
system you could kind of dead reckon and

717
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,120
that's called open loop control

718
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,840
and so that's if i like close my eyes

719
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,360
and i just reach out for a thing

720
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,640
and try to grab it and i don't know

721
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,400
where it is at all that's open loop

722
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,760
control that can work

723
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,559
sometimes you can count how long a motor

724
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,200
is on

725
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,120
and get it pretty consistent um

726
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,400
particularly with something like a

727
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
stepper motor which tends to be pretty

728
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,799
consistent in

729
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,120
the distance it goes um but if you do

730
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,840
that 100

731
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,600
200 5000 times you're not going to get

732
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,159
necessarily repeatable results and that

733
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,679
is not ideal right

734
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,760
and the way to solve that is by plopping

735
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,080
in some state information to your system

736
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,480
and you do that with sensors um you can

737
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,159
do that with a simple sensor like a

738
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,760
switch that you bump into

739
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,600
every third time on your motor you swing

740
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,360
back and you swing until you hit a

741
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,559
switch and then you know where you are

742
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,600
and you can go and

743
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,320
you can calibrate it and that's still

744
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,640
not

745
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,039
exactly closed loop control ideally you

746
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,919
have something

747
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,679
like a rotational encoder on there that

748
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,279
tells you exactly where you are at all

749
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:05,919
times

750
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,679
so as you try to move to a specific

751
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,960
location you know

752
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,159
when you're getting close and you can

753
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,000
slow down before you get there because

754
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,720
remember

755
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,799
inertia is kind of the enemy of your

756
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,919
control system

757
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,720
it's going to try to to keep moving even

758
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,240
after you stop moving so if you move to

759
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,039
the location

760
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,120
and then stop your motor it's too late

761
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,400
your inertia is going to swing you a

762
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
little bit past

763
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,120
so you need to just start slowing down

764
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,520
your motor effort before you get there

765
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,440
and there's a large amount of control

766
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,279
systems out there that will do this

767
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,799
some of them that are very very very

768
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,480
complicated and very efficient

769
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,760
some of them that are pretty darn

770
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,360
efficient and not that complicated like

771
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,400
the pid

772
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,760
controller which is kind of like the

773
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,600
bread and butter of your control systems

774
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,880
it was invented back in

775
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,320
i don't know maybe the 30s or 40s i'm

776
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,480
not exactly sure um

777
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,240
but uh but it's still used today because

778
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,520
it's so simple to implement

779
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,799
and so that's the one i would recommend

780
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,240
to most people who are trying to do a

781
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,120
control system

782
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,480
you can get more elegant than that you

783
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,880
can dive much deeper into control theory

784
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,480
if you choose to um so

785
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,039
uh yeah so that's kind of control

786
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,159
systems

787
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,039
uh in a very very very short nutshell

788
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,720
and basically this idea of open loop

789
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,000
versus closed loop is pretty

790
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,240
important um and as you try to have

791
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
higher and higher precision

792
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,200
you're going to need that closed loop or

793
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,799
else to just no way you can hit it with

794
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,760
an overloop system

795
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
cool i want to talk about degrees of

796
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,000
freedom also degrees of freedom are a

797
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,039
really interesting thing

798
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,080
um so uh

799
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
mechanical systems are designed are

800
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,520
defined as their

801
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,840
uh by their degrees of freedom and and

802
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,360
what i mean by degree of freedom is is

803
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,039
the way in which you can make them so

804
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,400
a motor has a single rotational degree

805
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,080
of freedom assuming the motor body is

806
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,640
fixed

807
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,159
there's only one thing and it's a degree

808
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,240
of freedom that's rotational

809
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,919
a slider on the other hand has one

810
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,480
degree of freedom and it's translational

811
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,400
a free body that means something just

812
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,520
floating there

813
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,720
has six total degrees of freedom it can

814
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,600
translate

815
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,840
in any of your cartesian directions and

816
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,120
it can rotate

817
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,000
along any of those axes right and so

818
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,279
when you are designing something that

819
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,799
you want to move you want to think about

820
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,559
what your degrees of freedom are

821
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,320
some of them you would like to constrain

822
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
so that you get just simple rotation

823
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
means you've constrained five of six

824
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,279
and left one free or sometimes you want

825
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,000
something that's going

826
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,559
to to have multiple degrees of freedom

827
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,159
operating simultaneously

828
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,679
and so if you're building something like

829
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,240
a robotic arm those can be

830
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,480
five six seven degrees of freedom at the

831
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,440
end effector

832
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,039
so you have a thing kind of moving

833
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,799
around but even

834
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,279
human arm usually is modeled as kind of

835
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,720
seven degrees of freedom

836
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,600
so you have three rotational here one

837
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,120
rotational your elbow

838
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,440
and three rotational at your wrist and

839
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
that's a reasonable mathematical

840
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,320
approximation though it turns out that

841
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,720
it's a lot more complicated than that

842
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
and we're really good at using them but

843
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
if you have multiple motors linked up

844
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,600
in a row you might have a multi-degree

845
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,240
of freedom

846
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,159
system even though each one is only

847
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,000
operating on a single degree of freedom

848
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,360
and that allows you to get to where you

849
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,720
want to be because you're going to

850
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,400
control all of those things

851
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,360
uh in your software and your electronics

852
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,320
independently

853
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,240
and so to try and get smooth motion out

854
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,840
of them eventually you need to think

855
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,880
about that like

856
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,039
okay if i need to be able to move to

857
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,399
rotate this thing

858
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,240
and translate this thing okay those are

859
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,600
two different degrees of freedom i'm

860
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,520
going to need two different actuators

861
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,279
because you need an actuator per degree

862
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,880
of freedom in order to get them to

863
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,559
operate independently

864
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,159
if they don't operate independently

865
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,679
maybe you've synced them together with

866
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,279
gears then it's only a one degree of

867
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,159
freedom system

868
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,279
and that's actually really convenient

869
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,120
that can be a really nice way to do it

870
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,520
um

871
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,120
and you see this sometimes out in the

872
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,640
field where uh

873
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,120
you know gearing or linkages create a

874
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,720
single degree of freedom system so i'll

875
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,159
show you a really cool

876
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,440
single degree of freedom system when we

877
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,799
get to the linkages stuff later on

878
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,799
but i do want to show you this which is

879
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,120
a really really neat example of a

880
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,039
486 degree of freedom system so far as i

881
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,480
know it it's one of the most complicated

882
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,120
things

883
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
this is a piece of artwork that some of

884
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,720
my friends made it's called morph it's

885
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,120
uh

886
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,880
it's a kinetic art piece each one of

887
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,919
those panels is independently operating

888
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,240
and they are those led panels kind of do

889
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,679
this it is mesmerizing to watch for

890
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,960
hours fortunately this video is only 12

891
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,080
seconds long

892
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,760
so and it's going to leave no let's not

893
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,600
do that

894
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
so that's a lot of degrees of freedom

895
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
and each of them is translational so

896
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,320
they're all kind of moving

897
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,880
in and out and they use these uh nclas

898
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,000
which i'll talk about

899
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,679
to do that later okay

900
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,080
we're done intro nailed it we're only

901
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,960
half an hour and

902
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,200
so power transmission let's just jump

903
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,320
through this

904
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,640
all right uh there are a whole bunch of

905
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,919
different types of power transmission

906
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,039
i'm gonna go over

907
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,640
uh three of them and then we're gonna

908
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,320
look at the math and then the types of

909
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,200
gear trains

910
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,039
and how that works because my hunch is

911
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,200
that the most useful stuff to you guys

912
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,480
is this uh is the kind of math of power

913
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,919
transmission

914
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,960
and uh so onwards we go so here's some

915
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,919
linkages

916
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,760
i'm just gonna spend one slide in one

917
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,039
movie on linkages

918
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,520
um but you see them out in in nature all

919
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,399
the time not nature in mechanical nature

920
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,960
in the case of this right here this is a

921
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
engine crankshaft

922
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,679
for an adjustable compression ratio

923
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,240
engine

924
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,000
which is super cool and

925
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
so you see that there are connecting

926
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
rods and things these are linkages so

927
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,720
you have

928
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,320
rotational degrees of freedom between

929
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,919
them but then they don't translate so

930
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:32,399
you can

931
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,960
fix them in places so this is a one

932
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,880
degree of freedom system

933
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,679
in that you have uh you've constrained

934
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,279
it such that the rotation of this

935
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,480
element

936
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
it becomes the translation of this

937
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,159
element assuming that you're not

938
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:46,880
threading in

939
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,080
and out adjusting this thing similarly

940
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,720
this is a one degree of freedom system

941
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,360
these are

942
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,200
mechanically tied so even though you

943
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
have multiple things all moving together

944
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,720
that little thing crawling over there

945
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,080
it's actually a single degree of freedom

946
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,240
system which is super cool

947
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,039
um they are excellent for things like

948
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,200
odd trajectories as you see

949
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,880
uh with the moving legs down there in

950
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,600
the right um they're also really nice

951
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,200
for converting between linear movement

952
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,640
and rotation as you see from the

953
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,840
crankshaft there

954
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,520
and they are great because they give you

955
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,360
reliably synchronous movement and what i

956
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,480
mean by that is if you need things

957
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,600
moving together

958
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
linkages are really nice for that so

959
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,960
they're a good tool to think about when

960
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,000
you're designing stuff

961
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,360
for those things they they tend to be

962
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,600
difficult for some things like vibration

963
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,520
um and because you're using a lot of

964
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,039
physical elements they can have higher

965
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,799
inertia and they can be kind of heavy

966
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,480
so they're not great for some

967
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,840
applications where you need it to be

968
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,120
light or where you need it to not

969
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,840
generate

970
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,880
vibration which can become acoustic uh

971
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,080
noise which is unfortunate okay let's

972
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,320
take a look at another movie here um

973
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,240
this is a buddy of mine who works in

974
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,480
this co-working space named flo

975
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,159
and he creates these incredible linkages

976
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,760
in kinetic artwork that's him

977
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,960
demonstrating it but you can see this

978
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,080
thing as it goes around you've got a

979
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,200
whole bunch of languages but this is

980
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
still a one degree of freedom system

981
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,039
that degree of freedom starts out with a

982
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,279
rotational actuator and then it becomes

983
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,960
all of these different really cool

984
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,559
translational elements

985
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,399
as it goes which i just think is the

986
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,000
neatest stuff um

987
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
i would definitely recommend following

988
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,080
him on instagram he's great one of my

989
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,640
favorite instagram accounts

990
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,480
okay let's talk about build some pulleys

991
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,799
we're gonna do this in uh

992
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,000
in i think one slide one slide um

993
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,679
so uh flexible linkages uh covers a lot

994
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,200
of different things it can be belt it

995
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,080
can be rope

996
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,360
uh it can be like steel braided cable

997
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,919
and it can be chained kind of so chain

998
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,039
usually has

999
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,120
one one degree of freedom in which it's

1000
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,320
really flexible

1001
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,919
and a degree of freedom that it's not so

1002
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,360
it's not particularly flexible in the

1003
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,720
other but it's not strong enough that

1004
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,080
you could really rely on it

1005
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,399
to move um in that direction i guess you

1006
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,840
could also think of a tank threat as a

1007
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,960
flexible linkage

1008
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,000
and the fundamental of this is

1009
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,760
that they they operate great in tension

1010
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,600
but as you compress them they buckle

1011
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,279
basically immediately if you think about

1012
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,399
trying to compress

1013
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,159
a rope you pull it taut it stays great

1014
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,000
in tension the moment you go like this

1015
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,360
it's already buckled under the force of

1016
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,320
gravity

1017
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,399
it's sagging like that and that's what

1018
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,000
defines these things

1019
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,320
so you can use pulleys to redirect that

1020
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,159
tensile force pulleys don't

1021
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,240
do not redirect compressive forces

1022
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,600
and if you think about this it's kind of

1023
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,360
evident if you think about that guy

1024
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,120
standing in the thing if he starts

1025
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,640
pushing on this to try and get the block

1026
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,919
to move down

1027
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,440
uh it's not ever going to move faster

1028
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,200
than like you know he sets it down on

1029
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,559
the thing keeps pushing to try and push

1030
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,679
it into the object it's not going to

1031
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,120
work the rope is just going to buckle

1032
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,880
immediately because it's flexible

1033
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,640
um so you can use these things

1034
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,279
uh to create mechanical advantages by

1035
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,039
doubling and by doubling what i mean

1036
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,240
here is that

1037
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,159
he's pulling on the load but actually

1038
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,919
the load is being distributed between

1039
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,279
this one line here

1040
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,399
the the right line and the left line

1041
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,799
on those and that allows him to move

1042
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,080
twice as far

1043
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,679
but distribute the load between those

1044
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,120
two so that block and tackle that's a

1045
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,640
simple block and tackle

1046
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,000
that's how you get the mechanical

1047
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,679
advantage out of that the pulley itself

1048
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,559
just redirects the forces and it allows

1049
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,080
you to redirect them in such a way that

1050
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,519
you can double them

1051
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,640
or more um so that's

1052
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,320
a super cool thing uh if you need your

1053
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,840
belts not to slip

1054
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,279
which is a major thing if you're using

1055
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,880
say steppers to drive something which

1056
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,480
you use commonly in like 3d printer

1057
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,440
applications

1058
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,360
timing belt is nice because it locks

1059
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,559
into

1060
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,799
uh it locks into your pulley or or your

1061
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,000
pulley wheel

1062
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,600
um and chains also because they

1063
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,840
synchronize onto sprockets they don't

1064
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,640
slip

1065
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,200
um if they do you have done some

1066
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,720
terrible damage to your system

1067
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,320
and i'm impressed really more than

1068
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,799
anything else um

1069
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,960
so what you can always know is the

1070
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
direction of rotation in this particular

1071
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,480
so the example that i've got down here

1072
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,240
on the bottom you know the rotation is

1073
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,960
going to be

1074
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,320
in the same direction so they're always

1075
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,640
going to rotate in that same direction

1076
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,880
and the effective gear ratio which i'm

1077
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,040
going to talk about as we get to gears

1078
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,159
is the drive over driven and so

1079
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,599
you can kind of see that here if i

1080
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,159
shrink my radius my

1081
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,199
um i'm going to have uh a let's see

1082
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,960
higher gear ratio and if i increase it

1083
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,560
i'm gonna have a lower gear ratio which

1084
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,359
gets me

1085
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,879
more torque out um and similarly

1086
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,040
my work in is equal to my workout times

1087
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,918
my

1088
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,159
my efficiency and so i can say hey like

1089
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,800
my smaller gear is going to move more

1090
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,399
quickly my larger gear is going to

1091
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,679
move more slowly and this

1092
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,199
works the same way the gears do which is

1093
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,119
why i'm not going into it too

1094
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,699
deep right now

1095
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,480
[Applause]

1096
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,199
we made it to gears 35 minutes past the

1097
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,719
hour and here we are

1098
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,119
okay so these are spur gears and i'm

1099
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,320
going to talk about the different types

1100
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,839
of gears in a second but this is the

1101
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,160
the cleanest example of kind of how

1102
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,720
gears and gear design works

1103
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
where you have this line of action as it

1104
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,000
showed right here

1105
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,359
that angle with respect to the tangent

1106
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,359
is what's called your pressure angle and

1107
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,960
so when you design you choose your

1108
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,320
pressure angle

1109
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,839
and that shows you here's some examples

1110
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,200
of what different pressure angles look

1111
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,760
like

1112
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,640
you can't really go much below 14.5

1113
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,160
which is a really conventional pressure

1114
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,640
angle

1115
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,480
because the teeth get too thin and they

1116
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,680
start to snap off

1117
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,119
you can go to these really high pressure

1118
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,720
angles but you start to lose efficiency

1119
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,680
at the higher

1120
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,040
at the higher pressure angles you also

1121
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,240
module is commonly used for tier

1122
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,440
for gear size um and that is

1123
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,720
represented in millimeters or inches

1124
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,160
um and so you would choose like a module

1125
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,880
one gear

1126
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,800
is in millimeters um and then your

1127
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,720
manufacturer will know and then they'll

1128
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,960
guess they'll know the size of the gear

1129
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,480
based on the total number of teeth you

1130
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,560
could also give them a pitch diameter

1131
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,440
and they'll figure out how many teeth go

1132
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,000
in there

1133
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,920
but the problem is if you specify that

1134
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,599
wrong you could end up with a fractional

1135
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,960
number of teeth which of course doesn't

1136
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,920
work as a gear

1137
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,320
so it's easier to specify tooth count

1138
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,079
module pressure angle

1139
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,000
uh when you're when you're specifying a

1140
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,640
gear in a mechanical schematic

1141
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,599
and uh and you would also always uh

1142
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,119
specify the material

1143
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,400
when you're getting this made by someone

1144
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,560
else um

1145
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,200
cool and and i've got this image on here

1146
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,079
um

1147
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,160
so that you guys can go back and look at

1148
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,359
it if you need to

1149
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,520
um you mount with the center distance

1150
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,720
which is

1151
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,119
uh this this pitch diameter the pitch

1152
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,560
circle

1153
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,040
halved the diameter plus the pitch

1154
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,839
circle half

1155
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,720
half of the pitch diameter from the from

1156
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,240
the other gear and that tells you your

1157
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,959
mounting distance

1158
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,359
when you have gears operating together

1159
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,480
you end up with

1160
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,800
a backlash and what this is is if you're

1161
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,240
rotating one direction you get this

1162
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,000
perfect synchronous motion as you rotate

1163
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,680
back the other direction it takes

1164
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,079
a fraction to move and that's something

1165
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,760
to pay attention to as you get more and

1166
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,599
more gears together

1167
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,920
the backlash adds up between them so if

1168
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,520
you have only two gears operating you

1169
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:09,839
have

1170
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,440
some backlash but if you run that same

1171
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,800
gear system back to back to back to back

1172
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,599
to back

1173
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,200
you now have five times that much

1174
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,720
backlash so you're gonna start

1175
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,000
spinning in one direction when you go to

1176
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,839
reverse it you're gonna spin for

1177
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,280
you know maybe a quarter of a rotation

1178
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,960
before you actually start moving the

1179
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,079
other direction

1180
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,359
and if you're using something where

1181
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,440
you're where your um

1182
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,160
your sensor is on your your motor then

1183
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,520
you may have

1184
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,280
very very peculiar outcomes um

1185
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,760
on the the kind of the end effector of

1186
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
your thing

1187
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,839
um it's difficult to prevent but it can

1188
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,440
definitely be minimized based on your

1189
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,960
gearing selections and i'll talk about

1190
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,160
that in a second

1191
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,760
um but basically it is a massive

1192
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,880
headache for your roboticists um because

1193
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,800
uh you need precision in your movement

1194
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,599
and this is just the killer of precision

1195
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,240
which is a bummer

1196
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,000
okay we're going to talk about gear

1197
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,760
ratio and i'm going to take a swig of

1198
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,000
water

1199
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,119
so that i don't lose my voice

1200
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,920
sorry for the wasting time

1201
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,119
um conveniently

1202
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,880
the ratio of radius diameter and tooth

1203
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,440
number

1204
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,160
always mix the same way so your radius

1205
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,880
of drive

1206
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,440
over driven your diameter of drive

1207
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,400
overdriven

1208
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,320
and your tooth number of drive

1209
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,480
overdriven will always be

1210
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,040
your gear ratio and this is really nice

1211
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,240
for your design

1212
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,000
um and and this is really convenient

1213
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,760
because oftentimes gears are specified

1214
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,280
by tooth counter

1215
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,880
and so when you're thinking about

1216
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,440
designing yourself a gear system

1217
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,720
um that is a really nice way

1218
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,880
uh to do it um and so um

1219
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,920
yeah so so uh

1220
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,560
you do it with those numbers if i have

1221
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,599
multiple gears

1222
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,920
moving along i take the output from one

1223
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,440
shaft and put it into the input of the

1224
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,119
next shaft then i can multiply the gear

1225
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,480
ratios

1226
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,119
from drive to driven drive to driven

1227
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,000
drive to driven

1228
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,839
so on so forth so let's take a look at a

1229
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,280
quick example i start with a

1230
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,320
two start worm gear and i'll talk about

1231
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,280
this in worm gears but that's

1232
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,720
effectively a two tooth

1233
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,240
here pushing a 24 tooth spur gear

1234
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,880
the shaft of that spur gear drives a 42

1235
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,680
spur

1236
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,839
which then itself drives a 60

1237
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,760
spur so now i can multiply that gear

1238
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,280
ratio together

1239
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,839
so i take my 2 over 24 let's drive to

1240
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:34,480
driven

1241
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
like 40 over 60 drive to driven i

1242
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,400
multiply those together that's 0.083

1243
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,720
times

1244
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,839
0.66 i get .055 as my

1245
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,960
total gear ratio and so what that gear

1246
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,880
ratio effectively means

1247
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,560
is that my output shaft moves .055

1248
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,040
rotations for every rotation of my input

1249
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,640
shaft so i'm really cranking around on

1250
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,680
my input shaft

1251
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,839
and my output shaft is just barely

1252
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,680
moving why would i do this

1253
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,079
well my output shaft is going to have a

1254
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,280
way greater torque

1255
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,040
than my input shaft which is really

1256
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,079
awesome so my torque ratio

1257
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,560
is my gear ratio lives in the

1258
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,400
denominator of my torque ratio and then

1259
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,079
my efficiency

1260
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,160
live up top so i'm going to multiply out

1261
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,079
all my efficiencies that's what that big

1262
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,040
capital pi is so the product of all of

1263
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,200
my efficiencies

1264
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,040
i'm going to then divide that by my gear

1265
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,800
ratio so

1266
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,119
i'm going to be having generating 12

1267
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,599
times as much torque on that output gear

1268
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,359
as i had on my input gear

1269
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,400
because of this worm gear plus my plus

1270
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,760
my spur gears which are geared in the

1271
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,000
right

1272
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,440
direction so i would note

1273
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,480
that my rotation is 18 times slower so

1274
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,079
i'm losing a ton of power to this

1275
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,119
inefficiency

1276
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,440
right like i'm getting a 12x torque

1277
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,560
multiplier

1278
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,760
but my uh but my rotation is

1279
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,880
now my speed is 18 times slower so it's

1280
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,800
a bummer of a trade-off but

1281
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,880
that is the loss of heat what i get for

1282
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
that is worm gears are extremely high

1283
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,240
ratio to their

1284
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,160
uh they're extremely efficient in terms

1285
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,520
of their packaging size

1286
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,720
and i'll talk about those when i talk

1287
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,119
about worm here specifically

1288
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,880
okay practical example is going to take

1289
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,560
me a second to pull this up because i'm

1290
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,880
pulling up calculations from my

1291
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,599
previous company and uh

1292
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,280
so it's gonna take me a second i'm sorry

1293
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,560
i should have had this a little bit

1294
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:35,839
better prepared

1295
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:49,839
oh sorry

1296
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,119
so sorry i'll go wait for this i promise

1297
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:57,610
um

1298
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,719
[Music]

1299
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,839
loading

1300
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,839
nope okay

1301
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,560
cool so this is going to load on up this

1302
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,400
is a design calculator that i use for a

1303
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,680
project that i was working on

1304
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,040
so the project that i was working on

1305
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,359
over here is a bed that lifts from the

1306
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,640
bottom to the top so i

1307
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,839
my goal was to specify uh a system that

1308
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:34,800
i could use

1309
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,880
to move a 60 kilogram bed to a height of

1310
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,119
2 meters in less than 30 seconds

1311
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,640
and that sounds really fast but actually

1312
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,400
30 seconds is pretty slow

1313
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,079
so as we look at this i've got my um

1314
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,000
my calculator over here and i'll show

1315
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,280
you how i've laid this out so you guys

1316
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,800
can get an idea of how all of this stuff

1317
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,599
works

1318
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,359
so true to form like a consultant all of

1319
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,119
my variables that i can change i have in

1320
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,880
blue and all of my static or calculated

1321
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,400
variables i have here

1322
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,560
in black so i can go through and i can

1323
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,079
change the different diameters of

1324
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,720
the things that i'm using so i'm careful

1325
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,680
to make sure that i use my units

1326
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,359
here so that i can keep track of

1327
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,680
everything so i know my revolutions

1328
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,440
millimeters minutes and that way when it

1329
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,040
comes time for me to look at

1330
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,240
my actual lift time um i can do all of

1331
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,920
that sort of stuff i'm also looking at a

1332
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,680
variety of other things like the torque

1333
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,040
required to move things

1334
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,480
and whether or not the motor that i

1335
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,400
currently have specified will actually

1336
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,160
work so the motor that i have specified

1337
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,200
in this particular system is a 775 just

1338
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,680
kind of a standard dc motor here

1339
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,599
um and this is how i went through and

1340
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,119
looked at it so here's my two meter

1341
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,960
travel distance in centimeters

1342
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,760
here's my motor rpms which i'm pulling

1343
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,240
off of a

1344
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,200
crud i don't know where i am um off of

1345
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,480
a motor

1346
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,680
data sheet um

1347
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,640
and uh and so that's that tells me all

1348
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,680
of the things i need to know so i'm

1349
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,520
looking at my 60 kilogram

1350
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,079
uh total frame weight here and that

1351
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,599
shows me that i'm not able to do it so i

1352
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,280
also in the same one i go down and talk

1353
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,319
about all my electrical

1354
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,520
and then i'm also looking at cost and

1355
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,920
the same thing so this is showing all of

1356
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,720
the different things

1357
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,240
my structural numbers all of these

1358
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,599
things so i recommend this is the way

1359
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:16,480
that i do it but

1360
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,440
uh you can you can go ahead and build

1361
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,720
your own one of these so this is just a

1362
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,079
normal spreadsheet and most of the

1363
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:22,960
things in here

1364
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,079
that are calculated are just

1365
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,160
multiplication and additional stuff

1366
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,839
right here's a lot of multiplication

1367
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,160
addition but that's all there is to it

1368
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
um so that gives you an idea of how i go

1369
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,839
about solving this problem

1370
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,359
when i'm doing this in an actual

1371
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,599
engineering way

1372
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,400
okay gear mounting here we are taking a

1373
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:40,800
look

1374
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,000
at um at mcmaster data sheets and they

1375
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,599
will show you the mounting distance for

1376
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,880
all of these things

1377
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,960
so over here in the spur gears you'll

1378
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,240
notice that it gives you a pitch

1379
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,000
diameter this is an american part so

1380
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,400
it's in

1381
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,720
inches and then i if i'm meshing that

1382
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,160
with one of the same then i know that

1383
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,000
that's my mounting distance

1384
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,760
uh access to axis and if i'm doing

1385
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,280
uh a different sized uh gear then i have

1386
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,640
that number and added to half this

1387
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,920
number and that gives my

1388
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,720
my mounting distance between the two

1389
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,200
that's

1390
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,119
how you do simple spur gears if i'm

1391
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,720
doing bevel gears you'll notice that it

1392
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,520
shows

1393
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,720
from the uh from the gear throat down

1394
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,200
here

1395
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,839
to the center of rotation here and if i

1396
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:22,319
look

1397
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,480
on this gear as well so they're showing

1398
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,680
two of the same gear

1399
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,040
then it would be the same the other

1400
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,119
direction but i may want to be using

1401
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,480
this to drive

1402
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,000
a different system so if i have a

1403
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,920
different gear ratio two with different

1404
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,040
numbers of teeth

1405
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,960
um then uh then i would i would use

1406
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,560
those those schematics respectively

1407
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,520
okay cool um and you notice if i'm

1408
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,560
looking here

1409
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,000
i am showing my my tooth pitch here

1410
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,880
and my number of teeth tooth pitch

1411
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,160
number of teeth

1412
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,720
right those are absolutely necessary um

1413
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,680
and it'll show

1414
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,280
it should show module in there somewhere

1415
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,560
so i don't see where it is

1416
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,880
cool let's talk about uh types of gears

1417
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,160
i'm showing you one here on the screen

1418
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,680
which i really love this thing is called

1419
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,920
a harmonic drive it's a zero backlash

1420
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,720
drive system

1421
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,200
it's extremely high gear ratios in

1422
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,040
extremely low

1423
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,280
uh form factor um they're really neat

1424
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,800
but it's kind of a specialty gear so i'm

1425
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,000
not going to get too far into them but

1426
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,359
there's tons of cool stuff on youtube

1427
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,079
about how

1428
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,319
harmonic drives work uh they are really

1429
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,280
really neat

1430
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,800
uh the other one here that i'm showing

1431
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,960
is what's called a joyce dayton jack

1432
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,359
um and this is a combination of multiple

1433
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,800
gears working together

1434
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,800
doing interesting stuff so it's a worm

1435
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,240
drive driving this

1436
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,880
this gear here the spur gear that drives

1437
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,920
a threaded rod

1438
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,920
for linear movement out of a rotational

1439
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,079
thing in an extremely compact way

1440
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,520
they're able to produce an incredible

1441
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,359
amount of force it's super cool and you

1442
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,800
see these sometimes in car jacks but

1443
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,599
also they're

1444
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,359
they're powered frequently to move stuff

1445
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,720
like stages around

1446
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,319
which is really really neat because you

1447
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,440
can put a bunch of these all over the

1448
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,000
place

1449
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,800
and you get that kind of balance i am

1450
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,079
going to talk about the gears over here

1451
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,440
spur gears bevels worms

1452
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,319
differentials planetaries um and well my

1453
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,079
others are right here on screen

1454
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,440
um i want to talk a little bit about

1455
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,440
efficiencies um because those

1456
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,640
are really important when you're

1457
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,640
thinking about your gear training spur

1458
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,400
gears are really high efficiency

1459
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,160
same thing with uh helical and double

1460
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,520
helical which i'll talk about

1461
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,079
in spur gears bevel gears are also

1462
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,440
really high efficiency

1463
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,319
where your efficiency starts to drop is

1464
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,319
when you're starting to move things

1465
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,520
kind of uh in in weird ways and so your

1466
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,680
worm gears have very high ratios so you

1467
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,200
can see the normal ratio range goes up

1468
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,000
to 75

1469
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,280
to one which is crazy um but its

1470
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,119
efficiency could drop as low as 20

1471
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:43,920
percent so

1472
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,720
there's so much power out of there oh

1473
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,599
it's a bummer

1474
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,280
um but uh but yeah

1475
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,359
so uh but you could still maybe use it

1476
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,400
because it's very compact

1477
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,800
single set of uh there's two gears

1478
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,079
measuring against each other

1479
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,480
i'm not going to talk about crosstelical

1480
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,079
uh really even though

1481
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,440
they're in this i guess i am a little

1482
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,200
bit in the worm section

1483
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,720
spur gears are what you think of when

1484
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,319
you think of gears

1485
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,119
they are like the most conventional uh

1486
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,040
gears you can 3d print these maybe not

1487
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,880
super well but they can be done

1488
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,559
um they're simple they're cheap they're

1489
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,319
super easy to manufacture

1490
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,440
they tend to be kind of bulky

1491
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,880
particularly if you start chaining them

1492
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,319
together and getting these really long

1493
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,359
gear trains

1494
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,319
um they're a little bulky um and they

1495
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,640
always have parallel axes

1496
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,800
but you can get really big gear ratios

1497
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,079
range off of them

1498
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,760
so you can do one to one or you can do

1499
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,280
like you know

1500
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,960
uh 10 to 100 and get that 10 to 1 ratio

1501
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,319
which is crazy

1502
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,880
um helical gears work a lot like spur

1503
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,240
gears but as you can see

1504
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,079
because i'm i'm spiraling the tooth

1505
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,359
around the outside they're a little more

1506
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,720
difficult to manufacture

1507
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,960
but the tooth is longer even in the same

1508
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,400
form factor and what that lets me do is

1509
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,920
have much higher torque

1510
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,280
and quieter movement because i'm

1511
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,119
engaging multiple teeth more teeth at

1512
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,240
the same time

1513
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,000
but they're more expensive to make um

1514
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,599
cool bevel gears are what happens when

1515
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,240
you want to change the um

1516
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,040
the direction of rotation um and not

1517
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,160
that you're rotating

1518
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,920
against each other but that you're

1519
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,079
you're changing the axes of rotation

1520
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,839
so your your shafts are always going to

1521
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,400
be coplanar so like here the plane is

1522
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:18,880
now

1523
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,960
like that um and they're pretty high

1524
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,559
efficiency they're as high efficiency as

1525
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,440
a spur gear

1526
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,599
typically and they're really common um

1527
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:26,960
and they're useful for things like

1528
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,480
drivetrains and that sort of stuff as

1529
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,440
you have to make your movement go around

1530
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,160
a bend and that bend is most commonly 90

1531
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,599
degrees but it doesn't necessarily

1532
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,599
have to be 90 degrees you can get bevel

1533
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,119
gears custom made

1534
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,000
that do them at weird angles those are a

1535
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,200
pain in the butt to design and i

1536
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,520
recommend against it if you can

1537
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,440
you can get them in uh straight tooth

1538
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,280
gears like you see on the top here

1539
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,559
and you can also get them in spiral

1540
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:51,760
tooth which has a lot of the same

1541
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,200
advantages you get out of the helical

1542
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,559
gears from the previous one

1543
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,599
and that you have the more uh tooth in

1544
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:58,079
contact

1545
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,599
with time so you can get more torque out

1546
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,119
of them and quieter movement but they're

1547
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:01,599
just a

1548
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,359
bigger pain to make and so they tend to

1549
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,839
be more expensive um crown gears

1550
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,040
are a type of uh bevel gear

1551
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,319
um and that's where you have a spur gear

1552
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,520
over here um hitting a 90 degree thing

1553
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,040
so it's a subset of bevel gears and the

1554
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,480
calculations are all the same

1555
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,319
conveniently bevel gears and spur gears

1556
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,400
calculate exactly the same way

1557
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,280
it's tooth to tooth ratio super duper

1558
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,559
easy on the calculations there

1559
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,880
worm gears are able to get these really

1560
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,240
really really high

1561
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,720
uh gear ratios because a worm gear is

1562
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,440
effectively

1563
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,359
like this one which is a one star worm

1564
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,760
gear winds the same tooth around the

1565
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,960
shaft a bunch of times

1566
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,200
that makes it a one tooth gear and what

1567
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,880
that means is that here where i've got i

1568
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,640
don't know what is that 18 teeth

1569
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,720
i would guess on the outside there where

1570
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,400
i've got that 18 tooth i now have a

1571
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
ratio of 18 to 1.

1572
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,920
which if i need to do that with spur

1573
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,760
gears means i you know like the smallest

1574
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,520
spur gear you can realistically have is

1575
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,559
about 80.

1576
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,200
really tan is better so that means i

1577
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,599
need 182 gear over here and this thing

1578
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,800
is going to be huge

1579
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,640
it's going to be massive so there's just

1580
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,400
not an efficient way to do it from a

1581
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,440
from a from a material space

1582
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,960
you can't fit it all in there this is

1583
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,720
worm gear super little efficient it's

1584
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,359
tiny

1585
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,640
um and uh and you know you can get

1586
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,280
pretty high efficiencies but like i

1587
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:21,839
would say a

1588
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,480
normal one start worm here like this is

1589
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,599
probably going to be in an efficiency

1590
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,359
range around 70

1591
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,640
so that's not great um but it's not

1592
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,280
terrible

1593
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,599
and they're not super duper expensive to

1594
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:34,400
create

1595
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,200
um the kind of the a similar thing here

1596
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,720
this is kind of like

1597
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,720
uh these crossed helical gears are like

1598
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,240
a worm gear but with many more teeth on

1599
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:42,880
them

1600
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,359
um so you know i can go from one tooth

1601
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,880
to a multi start thread

1602
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,640
to a four star once i get above four

1603
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,000
it's not really a worm gear anymore

1604
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,200
and it starts to become these crossed

1605
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,880
helical but as you can see it's just

1606
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,720
kind of a continuum from one to the next

1607
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,040
differential is one of my very very

1608
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,440
favorite uh gear trains and what it lets

1609
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,400
you do is

1610
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,720
typically a five gear system working

1611
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,000
together

1612
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,720
and it diverts power between from one

1613
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,359
input shaft between two output shafts

1614
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,119
and this is really really cool because

1615
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,480
it lets you

1616
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,800
drive around corners while one wheel on

1617
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,839
the inside

1618
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,520
needs to move slower the one on the

1619
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,800
outside needs to move more quickly

1620
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,800
because you're kind of going around

1621
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,440
this curve you need to be able to do

1622
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,520
that and so i have

1623
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,400
a video for that that i will show but

1624
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,000
before i move on to that i want to talk

1625
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,359
a little bit about this thing that i've

1626
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,800
got in the bottom left there

1627
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,400
which is what's called a south facing

1628
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,319
chariot and this was a device

1629
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,240
using differentials in the middle there

1630
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,440
you can see that schematic

1631
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,240
it was invented in ancient china and and

1632
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,920
this takes the output from the two

1633
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,480
wheels

1634
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,079
and measures them against each other so

1635
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,079
instead of driving the wheels a horse is

1636
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,200
driving the carriage

1637
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,800
but i'm checking this these wheels as

1638
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,559
they move with respect to each other

1639
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,240
to make sure that i have a gear system

1640
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,599
that always points

1641
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,200
south so before you leave the stables

1642
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,720
you set this thing to be south

1643
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,079
by shifting your wheels with respect to

1644
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,839
each other and then no matter what turns

1645
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:04,240
and

1646
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,480
over the course you go bumps and stuff

1647
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,240
this thing always points out

1648
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,800
it's just such an elegant gear system

1649
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,599
and uh

1650
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,200
proof of really really brilliant

1651
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,440
engineering in ancient times

1652
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,880
so neat so so so neat um so let's take a

1653
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,440
quick look

1654
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,119
um at a differential video

1655
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,200
um and i just want to show this so you

1656
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,559
can kind of get an idea

1657
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,559
um this one does a little bit better job

1658
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,839
of showing that thing

1659
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,280
rotate so you can see that i'm still

1660
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,280
getting a little rotation here

1661
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,280
on my right hand side but i'm getting a

1662
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,319
lot out of my left hand side

1663
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,839
stop that there and head back to our

1664
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:42,720
thing

1665
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,559
planetary gears are another really cool

1666
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,160
one there you've got that animated thing

1667
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,599
showing up there and they're sometimes

1668
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,640
called epic

1669
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,440
epi cyclic gears um the planetary gears

1670
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,400
is the common name

1671
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,000
you have a sun gear in the middle you

1672
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,359
have planet gears that travel around

1673
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:56,559
here and you have what's called an

1674
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,240
annular ring around the outside which is

1675
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,760
just a bunch of tubes on the inside of a

1676
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,640
thing

1677
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,280
they're extremely compact which is cool

1678
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,480
um and you can get

1679
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,559
um kind of medium and high gear ratios

1680
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,400
out of them by changing the ratio of

1681
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,720
your sun gear size

1682
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,760
to your uh your planet gear size and you

1683
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,119
can do this with tooth ratio

1684
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,440
as well the cool thing is because

1685
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,800
they're compact they can be chained

1686
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,319
easily coaxially

1687
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,240
this is how a lot of transmissions work

1688
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,760
is that they chain these things

1689
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,520
coaxially and then they shift what's

1690
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,400
changing

1691
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,200
uh or what's what's the driven and drive

1692
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,160
gear out of there

1693
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,000
so you can understand if i keep this

1694
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,359
same drive here

1695
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,000
but i now fix my planet gears my annular

1696
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,440
ring will start to

1697
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,079
rotate as well and i can do this by by

1698
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:40,960
breaking

1699
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,559
different things to get different

1700
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,440
rotations out of them

1701
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,000
okay there are some other ways you can

1702
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,359
trans transmit

1703
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,520
power um right here i've got a racking

1704
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,480
pinion

1705
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,520
um and that allows me to

1706
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,839
take rotational energy and convert it

1707
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,599
into linear energy and it's a very

1708
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:00,880
efficient way to do it

1709
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,480
but i have kind of a limited range to do

1710
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,160
it it's also important to know about

1711
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:04,960
clutches

1712
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,880
clutches are a method that allow you to

1713
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,240
engage and disengage

1714
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,319
rotational movement so if i have a shaft

1715
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,520
that's rotating and i want to have a

1716
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,680
shaft that i can either rotate or not

1717
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,440
um a clutch is kind of that it's

1718
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,000
basically a switch for power

1719
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,079
and what it basically does is basically

1720
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,160
two plates one rotating and then

1721
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,760
when i put the other one in contact with

1722
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,200
it friction

1723
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,079
overrides and it starts to it starts to

1724
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,839
to rotate alongside

1725
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,119
and this is neat if you want to be able

1726
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,880
to have something free rotate for a

1727
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,559
while and then engage to

1728
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:35,839
to another thing where you're having an

1729
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,520
output of the thing you do this a lot of

1730
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,440
times if you have an internal combustion

1731
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,720
engine and you need your wheels to be

1732
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,359
able to stop um and that's because

1733
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,960
uh your internal combustion engine will

1734
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,040
stall if you stop it completely

1735
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,480
so when you're driving a manual

1736
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,359
transmission you just engage the clutch

1737
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,440
and it allows your motor to continue to

1738
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,799
free rotate

1739
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,160
but your wheels can be stationary and

1740
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,200
that's good because you don't want to

1741
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,640
continuously drive all the time because

1742
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,520
stop lights are important

1743
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,520
bearings are a really really important

1744
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,720
part of rotational and linear movement

1745
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,359
um because they allow you to constrain

1746
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,079
your motion

1747
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,119
in your degrees of freedom on some axes

1748
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,200
so this is a plane bearing you can see

1749
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,319
it right up here

1750
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,599
hopefully it does it and you can see

1751
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:18,960
i've got a picture of it there and that

1752
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,520
allows

1753
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,319
rotation and translation along my shaft

1754
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,440
um

1755
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,880
and that's nice if i want to constrain

1756
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,720
things to move in a specific way

1757
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,440
they're cheap they're compact they can't

1758
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,359
get to super high rpms

1759
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,520
um and they do require lubricant you can

1760
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,599
get what's called self-lubricating

1761
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,440
uh bearings and that's because they put

1762
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,040
lubricant into the bearing already and

1763
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,079
it's slightly porous

1764
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,319
and it seeps back out it's super useful

1765
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:43,200
you can use them

1766
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,680
to hold a radial load and what i mean by

1767
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,319
that is

1768
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,880
i've got my shaft and i've got my load

1769
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,440
going

1770
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,200
on the radius to that shaft okay

1771
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,040
or an axial load which means i have a

1772
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,880
load pushing

1773
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,920
along the axis of my shaft

1774
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,400
and and you can get both depending on

1775
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,440
the shape of the bearing

1776
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,920
you can get slightly more expensive ball

1777
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,599
bearings this is you can see down there

1778
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,280
an unshielded ball bearing on the image

1779
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,000
but you can see

1780
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,440
what i've got here is a shielded ball

1781
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,559
bearing that just means they put a

1782
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:15,760
little piece of plastic in there to make

1783
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,359
sure dust doesn't get in there in case

1784
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,119
i'm operating it outdoors

1785
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,040
um ball bearings are also really cheap

1786
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,160
they're not quite as cheap as plane

1787
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,599
bearings but they're still pretty cheap

1788
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,359
they have much higher max rpms so if

1789
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,400
you're going to be spending something

1790
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,160
really really fast

1791
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,640
your ball bearings can go pretty dang

1792
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,440
quick

1793
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,480
um and they are typically rated for

1794
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,440
radial loads

1795
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,760
not axial loads but you can get ones

1796
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,880
that are rated for

1797
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,000
axial specifically or both

1798
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,760
um needle roller needle and roller

1799
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,799
bearings are a little more expensive

1800
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,240
i've got one here you can see as i take

1801
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,040
it apart

1802
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,599
i've got my rollers on the inside there

1803
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,480
and it spins

1804
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,920
this does both for ax radial load and

1805
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,280
axial load

1806
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,280
so i can load the crap out of it in this

1807
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,400
direction i mean i could probably put

1808
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,160
100 kilos on this bearing

1809
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,839
and still have it free rotate really

1810
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:03,760
nicely and i could probably do the same

1811
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,920
radially so you can see that it kind of

1812
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,280
falls apart if i don't have it in a

1813
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,760
thing i'd probably put 100 kilos of load

1814
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,000
radially and it'll still rotate freely

1815
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,359
so that's really cool that i can do it

1816
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,440
it only does axial load in one direction

1817
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,119
right like it literally falls apart the

1818
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,119
other direction um these are

1819
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,040
these are pretty expensive so this

1820
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,599
bearing i think was about 15 euros

1821
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,520
so they're awesome but they're expensive

1822
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,280
air bearings are where you have a gap

1823
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,880
between two very precisely made

1824
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,960
materials and you pipe air into it

1825
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,880
and then that air prevents things from

1826
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,200
touching and you can get extremely high

1827
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,280
max rpms like hundreds of thousands of

1828
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,319
rpms

1829
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,680
but they tend to be really expensive

1830
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,280
because the manufacturing tolerances are

1831
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,400
so tight

1832
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,599
you can also get these things called

1833
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,680
recirculating uh

1834
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,359
linear bearings they look like this they

1835
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,200
slide back and forth and you can see a

1836
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,119
cutaway diagram of it there that allows

1837
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,319
you to have that nice

1838
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,079
translational movement without getting

1839
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:57,839
rotation on any other axis

1840
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,760
so if you have something that's moving

1841
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,040
along a system

1842
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,720
these are a really nice way to do it and

1843
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,079
they're not super expensive i think this

1844
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:06,319
one was about 15 miles

1845
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,000
or dollars euros and dollars about the

1846
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,359
same these days

1847
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,160
um yeah and so you can see over there on

1848
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,520
the right hand what the inside of a

1849
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,359
roller bearing looks like

1850
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,799
threaded rods are a really nice way to

1851
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,520
to convert from rotational to

1852
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,559
translational

1853
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,599
motion what you can see down at the top

1854
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:26,240
is this

1855
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,079
rod with just kind of a fixed thread on

1856
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,720
it you can also get what's called

1857
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,720
ball screws and ball screws use an

1858
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,720
internal channel where they move

1859
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,480
balls around so it operates like a ball

1860
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,880
bearing and they have almost no backlash

1861
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,319
they're really really really cool for

1862
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,160
that so in very high precision

1863
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,079
things you often see ball screws use

1864
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,760
because they minimize that backlash but

1865
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,119
they work the same way that a threaded

1866
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:47,839
rod does

1867
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,440
and there's some math that uh that

1868
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,440
operates out and i wish i had time to go

1869
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,160
into it but i'm

1870
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,400
already over time oops we still have a

1871
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,760
long way to go because we haven't hit

1872
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,440
actuation at all

1873
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,440
we're gonna pick up the pace here i'm so

1874
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,559
sorry

1875
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,799
linear actuation this is a steam engine

1876
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:03,760
um and it's

1877
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,520
showing you linear actuation that's then

1878
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,920
turning using linkages into rotation

1879
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,440
i do want to talk about solenoids

1880
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,119
pneumatics hydraulics and electrical

1881
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,319
actuators i'm not going to talk about

1882
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,520
steam

1883
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,599
solenoids are just a magnet moving in a

1884
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:16,559
magnetic field

1885
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,079
so you you have an electrically

1886
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,000
controlled an electric coil and it moves

1887
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,880
a magnet

1888
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,640
it usually is linear movement between

1889
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,400
two points it can be spring return that

1890
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,839
means while it's energized it goes one

1891
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,119
direction and it returns when you

1892
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,000
de-energize it

1893
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,760
or latching means you energize it and

1894
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,520
goes one way and you energize it with

1895
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,960
the opposite voltage and it goes back

1896
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,319
the other direction

1897
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,079
they have extremely high power draw when

1898
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,400
active and a huge inductive load so you

1899
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,160
want to use a flyback diode

1900
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,319
google ad otherwise you're gonna roast

1901
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:43,760
whatever power supply you have

1902
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,760
i have learned this the hard way um

1903
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,520
speakers are really really similar to

1904
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,960
solenoids but they allow you to have

1905
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,400
movement within a range based on the

1906
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,280
voltage

1907
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,119
um and a spring that's going against it

1908
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,160
technically you can do that with

1909
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,160
solenoids but it's a little hard to do

1910
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,240
and they're built to displace a fluid in

1911
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,680
waves to create sound

1912
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,599
and a microphone works exactly the same

1913
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,280
way the speaker does but in opposite

1914
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,119
so it uses sound waves coming in to look

1915
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,559
at an electrical signal coming on you

1916
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,440
have to amplify that

1917
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,040
in order to get a useful signal out of

1918
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,960
it but that is uh

1919
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,920
don't have time for that pneumatics and

1920
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,720
hydraulics

1921
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,040
are really really cool and really useful

1922
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,280
um i use them for a lot of my stuff i

1923
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,040
tend to stray away from hydraulics

1924
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,240
because you have to have

1925
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,640
high pressure pumps typically to do them

1926
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,920
and so a 10 they tend to be pretty

1927
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,920
expensive

1928
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,640
but and but they have extremely high

1929
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,440
force

1930
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,559
operation within a range

1931
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,480
pneumatics don't really do ranges very

1932
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,240
well they operate really between two

1933
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:40,960
points

1934
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,480
but they are really they can be

1935
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,880
extremely fast like scary fast

1936
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,119
with relatively high force uh which is

1937
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,720
really exciting the forces

1938
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,720
correlate to the pressure that you put

1939
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,839
into them

1940
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:53,760
and i would absolutely for obvious

1941
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,440
purposes use a speed controller

1942
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,960
and that's a little needle valve you put

1943
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,280
on the inlet and that allows you to dial

1944
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,720
the speed

1945
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,720
down which is important if you open

1946
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,400
those all the way up pneumatic cylinders

1947
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,599
move scary fast and you can hurt

1948
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:06,480
yourself

1949
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,440
um and you typically control them using

1950
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,200
solenoid valves that i talked about last

1951
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,240
week

1952
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,680
for easy electrical integration um

1953
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,119
hydraulics tend to use very high

1954
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,240
pressure so you need to have a very

1955
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,599
robust system that adds a bunch of

1956
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:20,880
weight the nice thing about pneumatics

1957
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,520
is that they're very light

1958
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,680
you can use electrical linear actuators

1959
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,280
so there is such a thing as a linear

1960
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,240
stepper motor

1961
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,920
which is basically this thing i have up

1962
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,000
here in the top and it alternates

1963
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,720
electrical fields to move it across from

1964
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,400
north to south to north south north

1965
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,359
south and that gives you pretty precise

1966
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,640
motion they're extremely easy to

1967
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,960
implement but they're really expensive

1968
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,839
so what i recommend doing instead is to

1969
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:46,319
use

1970
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:49,440
a rotational to linear system

1971
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,079
to drive to drive your linear motion you

1972
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,599
can buy those off the shelf like this

1973
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,520
ball screw sliding table which i

1974
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,160
pulled the image straight off aliexpress

1975
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,359
or you can do

1976
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,680
that you can you can use a system so

1977
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,119
this is a threaded nut that fits on a

1978
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,640
rod that's turned by a stepper

1979
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,240
and that'll get linear motion provided

1980
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,039
you prevent it from rotating around

1981
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:11,119
which you can do with one of these handy

1982
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,880
dandy linear rails

1983
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,200
um you can also get these things called

1984
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,599
down here non-captive linear actuators

1985
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,640
nclas

1986
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,200
i have one right here and what this is a

1987
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,960
stepper body that's hollow

1988
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,480
but with a thread on the inside so when

1989
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,400
the stepper rotates

1990
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,000
it moves the threaded rod in and out

1991
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,359
they're really beautiful elegant

1992
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,119
machines and i hadn't seen them until a

1993
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:32,319
couple of years ago

1994
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,160
um but they're really really neat and

1995
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,359
they move things really well

1996
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,039
we actually use those in our beds for

1997
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:38,480
the first generation and they did not

1998
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,440
work very well

1999
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,880
they do a lot of force but just not

2000
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,200
enough to move the bed

2001
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,640
cool that's linear actuation let's do

2002
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,240
rotate rotary actuation

2003
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,720
even though we're already a little over

2004
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,319
time

2005
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:54,000
uh so rotary actuation i'm going to talk

2006
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,319
about this you need to actuate stuff

2007
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:57,680
it's often useful to have

2008
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,760
sensors you can get those in rotary

2009
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,079
encoders which i show here and those

2010
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,440
have a digital output where you're

2011
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,680
looking at the signal coming in off of

2012
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,280
them to figure out where you are

2013
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,599
and the number of counts dictates how

2014
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:10,720
much precision you get

2015
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,319
out of that you can also just do it

2016
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,319
within switches where you bump into

2017
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:15,039
something

2018
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:16,079
and then you know you're there because

2019
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,520
you bumped all the way into it those are

2020
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,160
really cheap

2021
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,440
and really useful and i have a drawer of

2022
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,440
them over there you can also use hall

2023
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,119
effect sensors those measure magnetic

2024
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:23,599
fields

2025
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:24,880
and you can make your own rotary

2026
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,480
encoders by having a magnet pass by a

2027
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,440
hall effect sensor

2028
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,799
and waiting for that hall effect sensor

2029
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,960
to blip um hall effects give a digital

2030
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,319
output so you could just measure high or

2031
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:33,200
low on that

2032
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,240
on that signal which is really nice cool

2033
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,520
i'm going to talk about those actuators

2034
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,440
coming right up that's now

2035
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,640
dc motors there you go the 775 right

2036
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:42,960
here

2037
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,400
on the camera and the 525 555 whatever

2038
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,520
it is 575

2039
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,920
up there on the screen this is a very

2040
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,760
conventional off-the-shelf motor and the

2041
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,960
way that these work

2042
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,960
brushed dc motors are extremely cheap i

2043
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,400
mean you can get them for less than a

2044
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,039
dollar

2045
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,880
less than the euro they do require

2046
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,640
what's called an h bridge which is this

2047
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,680
thing right here

2048
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,960
to operate and an age bridge just to get

2049
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,559
control speed and direction otherwise

2050
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,920
you could just power them and they just

2051
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,480
spin

2052
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,480
it's magical they're terrible for open

2053
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,400
loop control and the reason for that is

2054
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,039
that they

2055
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,079
are each motor is slightly different um

2056
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,280
they rotate differently under load

2057
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,280
they so so if you need if you need to

2058
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,960
get any precision out of them you need

2059
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,799
to have them with closed loop control

2060
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,400
um and that's really important i've got

2061
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,760
a schematic over here about how they

2062
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,799
work

2063
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,720
they use these brushes to alternate the

2064
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,160
polarity so all you have to do is apply

2065
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:32,880
dc

2066
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,200
current to them and they start to rotate

2067
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,119
super cool stuff

2068
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:39,119
you can also get what's called brushless

2069
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,960
dc motors and these work

2070
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,640
slightly differently where you're

2071
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,559
pulsing between different coils to get

2072
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,640
these things to move around

2073
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,160
so you can see one deconstructed right

2074
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,839
here all the different coils and they

2075
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,319
require an electronic speed controller

2076
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:54,160
they tend to have very high rpms and so

2077
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,240
they're often used in drone applications

2078
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,760
because you can control the speed of

2079
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,319
them

2080
01:05:58,319 --> 01:05:59,680
really really quickly which helps with

2081
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,359
that stability and control that i was

2082
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:02,400
talking about

2083
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,640
before they have a lot of the same

2084
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,400
problems with precise positioning that

2085
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,680
you would get out of

2086
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,960
um a dc motor because they uh they vary

2087
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,000
based on them

2088
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,599
so so i wouldn't use them for precision

2089
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:14,960
applications so much as i would use them

2090
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,280
for

2091
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,000
high speed applications they are really

2092
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,280
cool

2093
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,799
uh you can also get dc motors that have

2094
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,480
been geared down for you

2095
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,720
um you can get these ones these are

2096
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,480
originally like i think they were used

2097
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:26,880
for

2098
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,839
uh washing uh windshield wipers on cars

2099
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,200
they're extremely high torque you can

2100
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,599
see they're a worm drive hidden away

2101
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,839
underneath there um and they are just

2102
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,680
super duper high torque

2103
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,880
which is great if you have something

2104
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,720
that like you need to

2105
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,520
move at low rpm but high torque and they

2106
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,880
tend to be pretty cheap

2107
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,160
and pretty compact they're still not

2108
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,240
great for control though the slower rpm

2109
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,760
makes position tracking a little bit

2110
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,839
easier

2111
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,160
servo motors are motors with integrative

2112
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,599
feedback whether they're doing that with

2113
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,280
their own rotational encoders or whether

2114
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,799
they're doing it kind of the cheap way

2115
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:00,319
with a potentiometer

2116
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:02,319
um it depends so micro servos are the

2117
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:03,680
ones that i think are most

2118
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,559
accessible for most humans and so they

2119
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,319
have their internal

2120
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,000
closed loop control in the form of a

2121
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,480
potentiometer that lives inside of here

2122
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,000
and they have some gearing to give them

2123
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,760
much higher torque but at the end of the

2124
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,520
day it's really just a dc motor

2125
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,440
with a potentiometer that it drives and

2126
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,960
it uses a pulse signal

2127
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,280
to guide where that goes there's a lot

2128
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,880
of youtube videos

2129
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,799
on how to do servo control but the

2130
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,160
really nice they

2131
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,599
tend to have a limited range of motion

2132
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:31,680
they don't usually go full

2133
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,920
uh 360 degrees and getting them to run

2134
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,960
full rotations

2135
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,359
can be difficult um you can buy those

2136
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:38,079
but

2137
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:39,440
those are less common and they tend to

2138
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,640
be a little bit more expensive to get

2139
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,640
full rotation servos and even so

2140
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,920
a lot of times they'll limit themselves

2141
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,599
to like five rotations so it's not a

2142
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,119
continuous rotation thing

2143
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:48,960
you can get continuous rotation servos

2144
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,640
but i would

2145
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,799
recommend doing stepper motors instead

2146
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,720
hey a segway

2147
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,920
um so these use alternating coils to

2148
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,640
advance

2149
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,480
uh incrementally so you alternate

2150
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,680
between coil one

2151
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,720
and coil two to advance one step

2152
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,760
and the step uh and so electrically

2153
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,319
um this is pretty easy to do you use a

2154
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:11,760
stepper driver which i'll talk about

2155
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,880
in the next slide but you can advance um

2156
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,198
by your typical ones are 1.8 degrees you

2157
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:18,560
can get high precision steppers that are

2158
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,600
0.9 degrees

2159
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,198
um you sacrifice a little bit of torque

2160
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:22,799
for those at that higher precision

2161
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,799
they tend to be pretty low rpm they max

2162
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:28,080
out 1200 is a really fast moving stepper

2163
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,679
i would never really want to push one

2164
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,520
past about 800 rpm

2165
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,719
they tend to have pretty high torque

2166
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,359
given their body size um which is nice

2167
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,520
and you can get very precise movement

2168
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,799
out of them uh which

2169
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:41,040
means you can do open loop control on

2170
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,080
them

2171
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,439
with some reliability they're not

2172
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,679
terrible for it um you can also use the

2173
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:46,719
coils to break

2174
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,640
where you apply a lot of juice to them

2175
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,319
and they they hold everything in there

2176
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:52,640
which you can't do with dc motors um but

2177
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,158
you do need to have a stepper driver in

2178
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:55,120
order to use them

2179
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,880
so uh you have a couple of different

2180
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,479
options on stepper drivers they kind of

2181
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,238
look like this i've got some images up

2182
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:01,040
there

2183
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,520
um they're uh current limiting but you

2184
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,198
can the torque in your stepper is

2185
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:07,120
voltage-based you can put a lot of

2186
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,560
voltage into your stepper driver and

2187
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,359
then

2188
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,799
limit the current back down so your

2189
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,399
steppers don't overheat and that's a

2190
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,040
really good way to do it

2191
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,719
also most stepper drivers will allow you

2192
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,479
to do what's called micro stepping

2193
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:21,600
and that uses pulse width and modulation

2194
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,839
to uh control how much is going into

2195
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,198
each coil so instead of going

2196
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:27,120
directly from one coil to the next which

2197
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,880
is the highest torque way of moving

2198
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,120
uh you can do you can kind of phase in

2199
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,640
and out and that lets you get much

2200
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,880
higher precision so if you're 32x micro

2201
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:35,679
stepping

2202
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:38,319
on a 0.9 degree stepper you get that

2203
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,679
really really fine

2204
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:43,600
movement around at .028 degrees

2205
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,479
per input now you sacrifice torque by

2206
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:47,120
doing that

2207
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,560
so there's always that trade-off you're

2208
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,158
sacrificing torque to do that

2209
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:51,600
but you can use them easily with open

2210
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,279
loop control and uh

2211
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,199
you still need sensors for closed loop

2212
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:56,880
control so you may need a

2213
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,640
encoder for closed loop control but we

2214
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,920
talked about that already

2215
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,920
cool that's everything i'm 10 minutes

2216
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,840
over so dreadfully sorry

2217
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,880
um but uh

2218
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,360
let's uh oh let's let's end on a nice

2219
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,480
note engineering is all about

2220
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,640
persistence um stuff is gonna break

2221
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,719
but the rule of the rule of thumbs is if

2222
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,480
you can build it you can fix it

2223
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,400
so uh when someone knocks your thing off

2224
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,239
the table don't get too sad it's just an

2225
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:21,679
opportunity to rebuild it better this

2226
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:22,640
time

2227
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,400
all right i'm gonna start looking in

2228
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,239
chat for uh

2229
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,719
some q a it's you thought i got rid of

2230
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,480
that picture but i didn't

2231
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,239
sometimes i troll even myself that was

2232
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:39,678
me when i could still get haircuts
