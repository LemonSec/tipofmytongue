hi

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,719
i'm james and i'll be teaching designing

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,160
with complex geometry as part of

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,360
hackaday u

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,360
i first learned a program in 3d while i

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,359
was in architecture school and remember

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,480
being blown away by the visual

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,080
complexity that could be easily

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,039
generated

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,400
we'll be using grasshopper throughout

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,920
this course which is a visual

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,039
programming language

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,480
that means you don't need to know how to

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,160
program but it does all the things that

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
programming would otherwise do it's far

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,359
more intuitive

18
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,840
far easier to use in my opinion

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,399
grasshopper came out in beta around 2007

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,800
which is when i got my first job

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,239
i remember being in the office looking

22
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,440
over the shoulders of people who knew

23
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,239
how to use it

24
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,680
and being announced at all of what they

25
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
could do i self-taught myself in the

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,800
software and then

27
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,559
learned it in much greater detail when i

28
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,680
went back for further study in

29
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,280
architecture in london

30
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,280
since then i've made the switch to doing

31
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,760
cnc fabrication and furniture making

32
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,440
and use rhino and grasshopper

33
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
extensively for that

34
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,359
each class in this course will begin

35
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,359
with a slide based introduction where i

36
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,280
introduce the concepts of the week

37
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,960
and then i'll do an example from start

38
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
to finish introducing components of

39
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,600
increasing complexity which will be

40
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,840
followed by time for you to

41
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,240
do the example yourself share your

42
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,759
screen get help where and when you need

43
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,080
it

44
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,680
we'll then do a second example and

45
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,200
there'll be another kind of q a time

46
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,159
after that

47
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,520
i hope you'll join me for this course

48
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,119
i'm really looking forward to it i hope

49
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,840
to see you there
