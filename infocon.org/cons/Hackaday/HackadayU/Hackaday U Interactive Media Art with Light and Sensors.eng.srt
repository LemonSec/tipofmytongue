hi

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,400
i'm maribel jones and i'm an interactive

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,240
artist working with new technology

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,920
i'm also a software developer and

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,400
educator previously i worked as a senior

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,080
designer developer at meow wolf

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,760
building room scale interactive art

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,600
installations i'm partnering with

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,279
hackaday to bring you all this class on

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,439
developing your own interactive artwork

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,560
using tools like arduino and fast led in

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,840
this class students will learn how to

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,599
work with sensors including motion

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,320
sensors

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,480
light sensors temperature sensors and

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,559
microphones as well as other input to

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,000
create their own interactive

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,600
programs using the circuit playground

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,040
microcontroller

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,200
we'll also learn about leds sound

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,039
components and how to make robotics

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,559
projects with moving parts

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,520
using servos this course is suitable for

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,480
complete beginners

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,160
as well as experienced developers and

27
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,520
makers who are familiar with

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,039
microcontroller programming

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,559
but want to learn more about designing

30
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,719
and developing for interactive art

31
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
we hope you'll join us for this exciting

32
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,399
course in interactive technology

33
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,720
using sensors
