00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
[Music]

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,920
welcome everyone

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,400
and welcome back to people who have been

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,440
following the

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,880
quantum computing class through comics

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,960
by hackaday so this is our 20th session

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,800
it's been quite a while we started in

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
april

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
and through hacker day i've been

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,199
teaching this

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,320
throughout the pandemic this is

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,760
every sunday we're meeting all of you

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,680
we also invited a lot of other

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,200
communities to come in

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,680
i think for some people who joined after

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,000
microsoft reactor started

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,719
advertising this is session 12 but

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,559
really i i probably should stop counting

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,680
this because we kind of

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,280
have merged a lot of communities here

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
uh just a reminder to people who haven't

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
been to this class

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,559
all the information is on hackadays

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,440
project quantum computing through comics

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,799
every sunday

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,920
unless i announce some special

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,840
arrangement like last weekend we didn't

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,439
have a class

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,479
we would have a sunday

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,360
for 30 minutes to an hour talking about

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,159
one pro

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,119
one topic and it could be theory it

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,640
could be programming

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,439
today we're going to talk about hardware

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,000
and there

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,240
after the class we'll have some q a

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,040
session

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,280
we have quite a few community members

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,040
now working on their

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,920
respective quantum computing projects

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,320
who

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,159
would like to share so feel free to

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
share that during that q a session

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,479
our official documentation is from the

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,439
microsoft

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,159
q sharp documentation and we also have

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,920
been using the quantum cutters

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,720
for exercises for people who missed this

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,159
please go back to

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,799
previous classes and also try some of

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,200
these

52
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,880
hands-on exercises that would help you

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,640
get understanding of the topics that we

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,479
talk about so we have spent quite a

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
lot of time talking about the

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
fundamentals for

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,360
quantum computing from concepts to using

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,480
linear algebra

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,760
and computing language q sharp to build

60
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,000
algorithms and eventually we're going to

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,720
run our algorithms on hardware

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,000
i actually gave a class on hardware

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,840
some time ago on in on may 3rd

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,480
so that's in the hackaday list session

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,280
6.

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
if you missed that one please make sure

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,959
that you go back to that

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,080
i won't be repeating some of the content

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,400
that i already mentioned in that class

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,560
so today we're gonna jump ahead a little

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,599
bit

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,319
and hardware i guess there are two

73
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,560
aspects i want to mention here

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,080
one is that uh right now we have

75
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,040
quite a lot of companies that are

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,560
building cloud solutions

77
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,519
so you're not going to have like a

78
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,599
pocket-sized quantum computer

79
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,720
anytime soon but you can use your

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,239
existing pc or any

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,680
computer to write algorithms that can

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,200
access our hardware infrastructure

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,720
through the cloud

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
so there are already working quantum

85
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,480
computing hardware

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,920
that we are giving to customers to

87
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,400
run their projects on and the other

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
aspect about hardware is

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,560
the various types of hardware

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,360
architecture

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
so i'm going to give a very quick

92
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,599
overview but we're going to talk a bit

93
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,480
more about

94
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,000
the topological qubits which is the

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,720
architecture microsoft is pursuing

96
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
that's probably conceptually the most

97
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,920
unfamiliar to most people so we're going

98
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,519
to talk about that one

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
primarily for this class a quick recap

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,080
from the last

101
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
session six that you can look at

102
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,319
these past topics

103
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,280
including the different architecture of

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,640
hardware

105
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,159
recap is that classical computers is

106
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,399
built on transistors as the building

107
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,519
block which are

108
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,798
just one uh on and off switches one and

109
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:21,918
zero

110
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,960
using transistors and we know that

111
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
quantum computers fundamentally

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,800
we need systems that behave in a quantum

113
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,280
mechanical way even though you can argue

114
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,800
that transistors are also quantum

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,080
mechanical but

116
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,639
you need to be able to support the

117
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,240
quantum computing

118
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,040
methods meaning we need to use

119
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,400
superposition

120
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,160
of energy levels and you find systems

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,560
that

122
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
offers you those energy levels that

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
could be put in superposition

124
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,720
so a natural example would be something

125
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,840
like electron

126
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,800
spin up and down energy levels and how

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,639
do you trap electrons you can

128
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,320
put them in quantum dots which are

129
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,600
fabricated semiconductor

130
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,639
sandwiching a thin layer of electrons

131
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,520
and then you can

132
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,440
confine your electron into only one

133
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,720
dimension and you can trap

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,199
electrons there and manipulate spin up

135
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,320
and down

136
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,840
so you can create your quantum bit

137
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,600
zero and but you can also trap electrons

138
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,039
in

139
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,560
crystal lattices here is example using

140
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,440
a diamond you can actually get a vacancy

141
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,000
and i

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,680
replace one carbon with nitrogen

143
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,039
atom and also carve out

144
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,639
a carbon that would create a nitrogen

145
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,440
vacancy

146
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,280
center that can trap some electrons

147
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,840
there you can also use that

148
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,880
but you can also build much

149
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,919
more scalable systems like iron traps

150
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,440
you can have irons spain

151
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,840
you can control which spain state your

152
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,880
system is at

153
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,400
and then use that as your qubits

154
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,600
or you can build artificial atoms

155
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
like superconducting circuits that's

156
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,880
basically lc circuits get that gives you

157
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,919
a resonance

158
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,600
and then you can use the energy level

159
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,080
that's quantized in that resonance

160
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,080
as your qubit states

161
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,919
this is blazing very fast but

162
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
for the past recording session six you

163
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,199
can

164
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,560
take it slow a little bit and then

165
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,520
there's the silicon photonics type of

166
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,240
quantum

167
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,919
bits you can encode your states into

168
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,199
the photons polarization states

169
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,400
but microsoft is using this topological

170
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,599
type that is

171
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,840
very special quite different from the

172
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,520
previous few examples

173
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,599
where it's relying on individual

174
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,360
electrons or

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,560
artificial atoms or irons

176
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
individual spin level this is using a

177
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,599
collective interaction

178
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,199
between a lot of electrons and

179
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,840
we can create some special condensed

180
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,960
matter states

181
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,560
called the majorana zero modes

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,639
and uh they can be formed on

183
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,160
semiconductor insulator superconductor

184
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,280
heater structure like here is showing

185
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,800
another wire on top of superconductor so

186
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,039
i'm gonna spend a little bit more time

187
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,599
on this particular architecture today

188
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,000
the other ones you can i i think

189
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,160
conceptually are easier to understand

190
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,120
but this one i would give some basic

191
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,160
ideas for

192
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,360
you to dig deeper later

193
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,800
uh just some research papers that gives

194
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,240
you

195
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,879
an idea of how these structures look

196
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,759
like

197
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,440
you can have stacks of your aluminum

198
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,560
nanowire

199
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,479
and is covered with

200
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,080
insulators and put on

201
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,199
superconductor you can apply metal gates

202
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,800
on them to control

203
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,080
so these are already some papers a while

204
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,879
back

205
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,520
there are already a lot of new

206
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,039
architecture

207
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,759
new structure of these kinds of

208
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,440
nanowires you can look up

209
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,879
now but i wanted to show a

210
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,640
picture just like an actual sm image of

211
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,919
that

212
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,839
so the basic idea of creating a

213
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,360
nanowire topological future structure

214
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,440
is started as a theoretical construct

215
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,560
so you can think

216
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,959
mathematically when you want to create

217
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,160
or annihilate any particle

218
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,680
you can use these ionization and

219
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,959
creation operators to to just

220
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,279
mathematically represent if you have

221
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,240
a particle or not and you can describe

222
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,760
your electron using these

223
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,279
operators and say here i want to

224
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,680
create a electron and i have this

225
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,600
creation operator

226
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,920
and you can further even mathematically

227
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,800
write that

228
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,760
you can actually represent this whole

229
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,880
electron with

230
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,480
a major on a pair which is a

231
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,040
pair of

232
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
quasi-particle or pseudo not real

233
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,160
particle but

234
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,320
you can mathematically represent them as

235
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,360
a pair

236
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,399
of a symmetric

237
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,640
and anti-symmetric part and in this way

238
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,760
this is a kind of a thought experiment

239
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,680
i'm just using a little bit of math to

240
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,800
show you that you can

241
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,880
mathematically write down all of the

242
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,959
following steps

243
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,560
if you can represent your electron with

244
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,160
this

245
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,680
mirror on a pair then there's no reason

246
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,480
you can't put

247
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,040
a row of them together and you can also

248
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,320
mathematically write

249
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,240
how this role of electrons would look

250
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
like so each of them

251
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,519
will have a pair and um

252
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,640
they kind of on their own but then if

253
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,680
you put this whole nanowire

254
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,040
on a superconductor then some something

255
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,760
could change

256
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
the field from the superconductor could

257
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,800
affect

258
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,399
your electron states in the nanowire

259
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,360
and the pairing could even switch so you

260
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,560
still will have

261
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,600
a symmetric and antisymmetric parts

262
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,920
paired together but then is between

263
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,000
adjacent electrons

264
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
so if you put this narrow wire on a

265
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,160
super

266
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,760
conductor and pair them in this way

267
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,959
then your end two states

268
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
could be alone they don't they don't

269
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,440
have a pair

270
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,920
now you imagine you can these are the

271
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,040
valid states

272
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,160
that all all these pairs can sit in and

273
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,399
now if you remove all the electrons

274
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,560
these are still going to be the states

275
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,519
that's

276
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,279
allowing your electron to occupy and

277
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,079
you start to gradually fill in electrons

278
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,760
you could have end up with different

279
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
situations

280
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,160
so it doesn't matter how many electrons

281
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,680
are in between

282
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,720
the two ends as long as

283
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,200
you have two situations that have

284
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,880
exactly the same number of

285
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,000
electrons in between you could create a

286
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,160
configuration where

287
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,760
the two end states are empty or the two

288
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,160
end states are occupied

289
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,600
uh the in the middle here

290
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,880
they don't actually have to matter where

291
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,360
exactly the electrons are but you have

292
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,560
to make sure that

293
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,240
in these two configurations the center

294
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,399
the middle ones will have the same

295
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,680
number of electrons

296
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,639
they only differ by one electron in

297
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,240
these two situations

298
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,320
so when you don't have the electron the

299
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,240
two end states are empty but if you have

300
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,720
that one

301
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,600
x-ray electron these two states will be

302
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,720
occupied

303
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,720
and this way you can effectively create

304
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,800
a zero and one state for qubits

305
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,920
and you can even measure which state

306
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,360
your system is at using a global

307
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,480
parameter like a

308
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,320
conductance so you can just say that if

309
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,120
you measure this kind of conductance

310
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,920
is in one state when these two end

311
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,880
states

312
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,560
and they're called the zero modes i

313
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,240
mentioned earlier

314
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,519
they're occupied or when they're empty

315
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:49,839
you

316
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,240
could be on this state when you do a

317
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,360
measurement you see

318
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,279
in the conductance so then you can

319
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,880
manipulate to be

320
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,839
to have these two in superposition and

321
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,800
here

322
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,360
interestingly the energy for these two

323
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,160
states are

324
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,680
actually exactly the same they're just

325
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,959
different

326
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,079
by this configuration and

327
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,839
this way you can even use the two states

328
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,200
as your qubits

329
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,399
zero and once and i like to make this

330
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,920
matter for like how do you

331
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,800
measure conductance to know what's going

332
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,440
on

333
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,040
so it's kind of like a train

334
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,320
that is needing a driver but in this

335
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,079
case you actually need two drivers you

336
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,440
must have two drivers

337
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,160
on both ends to have the train conduct

338
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,600
but then another case would be no

339
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,399
drivers and the train is sitting still

340
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:50,959
so that

341
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,279
is a different state and doesn't matter

342
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,720
what how many

343
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,839
people are inside but having the drivers

344
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,959
on both hands would make it conduct

345
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,320
this is just a metaphor uh

346
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,000
turned out that this particular way of

347
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,360
creating qubits

348
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,079
is the least error prone comparing to

349
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:12,880
all of the

350
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,639
the other architecture it is also

351
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,360
really really hard to make so this is

352
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,760
this

353
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,720
type of qubits are called topological

354
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,060
qubit

355
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,360
[Music]

356
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,160
you really have to go into the mass and

357
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,360
look at their

358
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,240
energy band structure to really

359
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,600
understand what's going on

360
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,639
inside your actual material but we often

361
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,399
also hear and see a lot of analogy like

362
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:40,880
this

363
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,560
is if you have these two

364
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,760
items a teacup and a donut

365
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,800
at very local level you wouldn't be able

366
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,920
to tell

367
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
what topology they have the same

368
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,600
topology so you wouldn't be telling them

369
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,320
apart

370
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,720
only when you zoom out at a global level

371
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,600
you will then

372
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,880
know which is which so

373
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,160
in this case the topological qubits

374
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,279
are not so affected

375
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,320
by local errors you

376
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,000
you still need to isolate them you need

377
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,760
to carefully set up your system

378
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,160
not to be contaminated by the

379
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,440
environment

380
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,959
but is very is

381
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,480
is much less prone to the environmental

382
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,720
error

383
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,720
so a few concepts i want to briefly

384
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,639
discuss

385
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,320
to build a topological quantum

386
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,600
bit is you need to understand these

387
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,800
idea about quasi particles so you are

388
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,959
using actual materials

389
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,000
to make your hardware and

390
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,959
that's often like solid states metals

391
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:53,680
and

392
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,040
semiconductors or superconductors

393
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,240
where you have these

394
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,279
atom lattices and then you will have

395
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,399
electrons going through the lattices and

396
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,759
that's what's contributing to

397
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,000
conductance when your electrons are

398
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,480
moving

399
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,519
through the material how fast

400
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,240
and how mobile they are defining how

401
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,800
conducting your material is

402
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,680
and here's the quasi-particle idea so

403
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,000
you

404
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,600
can't individually consider

405
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
every each atom or a particle electron

406
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,959
anymore

407
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,570
because you have all these

408
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,880
[Music]

409
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,959
obstacles for electrons to to avoid

410
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,920
and uh there are positive charges which

411
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,680
would attract electrons

412
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,839
and the electrons themselves will also

413
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,279
repel each other

414
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,959
so collectively they kind of have to

415
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,120
correlate each other's movement and they

416
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,160
have to

417
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,759
move together in a collective way

418
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,959
and this collective excitation is called

419
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,279
the quasi-particle is not a

420
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,480
very definitive particle

421
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,119
fundamental particle but it's as a whole

422
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,599
called a

423
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,160
positive particle a analogy i i make is

424
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,359
say you have a room of people and then

425
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,280
some vip enters

426
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,119
naturally some people want to be closer

427
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,119
to the vip and some people may be

428
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,119
scared of the vip and move a little bit

429
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,160
away from it

430
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,679
so as the vip moves around in this room

431
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,400
everyone kind of reconfigured themselves

432
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,039
to

433
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,400
to move uh together with the vip

434
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,559
so this vip electron is kind of a

435
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,679
overall carrying

436
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,160
effective mess with them as they move

437
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,720
along

438
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,960
the material so this is the

439
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,559
quasi-particle that has

440
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,880
a effective mass and that's what we're

441
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,559
dealing with when we are setting up

442
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,360
these

443
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,840
architecture these materials and

444
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,919
another concept to

445
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,240
know about is the statistics of these

446
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,640
quasiparticles you may have heard of the

447
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,200
fermions and balsams they have different

448
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,480
statistics

449
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,840
namely that fermions can occupy the

450
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,919
um if they have different spins you

451
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,559
can occupy to have two of them occupy

452
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,200
the same

453
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,120
energy level but no um

454
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,880
same spin can occupy the same level so

455
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,200
they

456
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,280
they would follow the statistics they

457
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,840
will occupy one by one the energy levels

458
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,240
separately but both zones they can

459
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,320
occupy the same energy level so you may

460
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,440
heard of the term

461
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,600
both einstein condensate where you can

462
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,559
condense all of the bosons into the same

463
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,720
lowest ground energy but when you have a

464
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,840
major on that particle they behave like

465
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,240
neither

466
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,840
is a quasi-particle so

467
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,520
they behave in a statistic called anions

468
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,320
and it's different from fermions on

469
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,360
bosons

470
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,880
because major on a quasi-particles turn

471
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,240
out to be their own

472
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,559
anti-particle and they follow a

473
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,880
different

474
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,559
statistics because they follow different

475
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,960
statistics

476
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,559
they are

477
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,720
behavior their arrangements will be

478
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,919
different from

479
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,520
from the other types

480
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,600
and the dimensionality will also

481
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,720
give you a different properties for your

482
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,760
materials

483
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,200
like electrons inside 3d 2d

484
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,480
1d and 0d will behave differently

485
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,600
and when we have another wire we are

486
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,160
effectively confining the electrons into

487
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,880
1d

488
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,919
so it will also have a different type of

489
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,160
behavior from other dimensions so

490
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,919
just a little bit about what how anions

491
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,840
work and in fact that these

492
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,559
quasi-particles used in the topological

493
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,760
quantum computing follow something

494
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,600
called the non-umbelian

495
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,159
anions these terms come from group

496
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,039
theory

497
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,240
or you uh you you

498
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
would describe the statistics of

499
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
different types

500
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
of anions so what is uh ambelian is

501
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,559
probably familiar to more people it just

502
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,440
means that

503
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,960
um is order of the

504
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,760
the terms do not matter so if you have

505
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,240
two elements in this group

506
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,320
if you change their order is basically

507
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,039
the same thing you could be adding just

508
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,720
a phase a global face

509
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,799
to your state and when you do some

510
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,600
measurements um the global phase doesn't

511
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,480
really matter

512
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,280
that's that's unbelievable statistics

513
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,600
but if it's non-unbelievable

514
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,559
then the order of which one is in front

515
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,120
of

516
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,159
the other will matter if you

517
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,360
change their order then

518
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,120
um you're effectively using a unitary

519
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,320
matrix

520
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,120
to to change their orders and we know

521
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,799
about unified matrices

522
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,880
they are they're what gates are gates

523
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,720
are unitary matrices

524
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,720
so effectively if you can braid these

525
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,159
marina quasi particles or zero modes

526
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,600
you could effectively add

527
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,039
gates to it so this is how you can

528
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,240
make a qubit and then add gates to it

529
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,159
by kind of reordering the

530
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,919
the anions so braiding is how you can

531
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,280
create gates

532
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,039
and i know that there there's been a lot

533
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,400
of development and

534
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,440
perhaps braiding is not the only way

535
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,559
to create gates but i'm trying to just

536
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,000
give you some

537
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
basic ideas and if you want to be

538
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,640
very up-to-date check out some latest

539
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,960
publications from the microsoft

540
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,559
quantum computing research teams

541
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,679
so now you know that

542
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,840
you can set up zeros and ones and you

543
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,039
can also use braiding statistics to form

544
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,880
your gates

545
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,799
but how do you how do you actually do

546
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,159
that in

547
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,520
actual material so

548
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,159
you can you can have a lot of control to

549
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:36,720
your

550
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,799
setup like i showed earlier in the

551
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,039
picture you can have a nanowire

552
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,840
and you can apply gaze to it turns out

553
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,679
if you look at the hamiltonian

554
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,799
for the your system you will have

555
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,520
a chemical potential term and a kinetic

556
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,440
energy term

557
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,159
you can control the chemical potential

558
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,120
by applying different gate voltages

559
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,480
so you could apply some voltage to put

560
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,280
it

561
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,760
put your nanowire in a triple state

562
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,640
where your

563
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,039
chemical potential is dominating over

564
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,320
kinetic term

565
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,360
in this case that would be a pretty

566
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,760
uninteresting or maybe normal like uh

567
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,840
show earlier without that

568
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,880
superconducting field effect

569
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,039
where your pairing is within the

570
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,480
electrons themselves

571
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,720
but you can put them in this topological

572
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,840
phase to

573
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,400
when your kinetic term is higher than

574
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,200
the

575
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,720
chemical potential then you would

576
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,480
then have this topological phase

577
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,679
so you do need at least

578
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,279
three anions to do the braiding

579
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,600
so you can set up something like a

580
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,559
t-junction

581
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,039
where you can apply the different

582
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,600
voltages to control chemical potentials

583
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,760
in different sections in your your

584
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,320
junction and then you're effectively

585
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,240
allowing these pairs to change locations

586
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,960
so in this case you you can allow the

587
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,799
braiding to happen between

588
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,840
onion two and three by just

589
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,039
allowing them to to move

590
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,840
to a different place on the t junction

591
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,559
this is a

592
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,760
really much much much simplified picture

593
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,120
but i just wanted to um briefly

594
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,240
explain that how you can achieve this

595
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,799
with actual materials we also need to

596
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,840
cool them down to low temperature so

597
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,120
uh quite a few

598
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,760
building computing architecture rely on

599
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,880
low temperature

600
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,840
there are a couple of reasons one is

601
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,360
that

602
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,200
noise can come from temperature

603
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,159
and temperature in the case of quantum

604
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,679
mechanical measurements

605
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,039
is our enemy we know that in materials

606
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,400
when you have

607
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,919
any temperature is giving energy to your

608
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,159
particles and they can vibrate they can

609
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:04,960
jitter

610
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,039
and when your electron is trying to move

611
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,080
your material

612
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,720
the more vibration from the lattice the

613
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,200
less

614
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,360
the more difficult it is for the

615
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,360
electron to move through the material

616
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,279
so that that is creating a lot of

617
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,760
resistance so resistance is basically

618
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,960
noise

619
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,679
if this happens then it can mask out any

620
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,960
of the quantum

621
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,880
mechanical behaviors that you actually

622
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,159
want to observe

623
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,000
so you need to cool your temperature

624
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,840
down to a certain level

625
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,720
in order to have these bounce around

626
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,120
these

627
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,320
scattering much less than your

628
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,039
quantum phenomena the dilution

629
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,880
refrigerator is what we use

630
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,760
in labs that could cool things down to

631
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,200
really low temperature

632
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,640
um it can go down to like tens of milli

633
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,679
kelvins

634
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,120
uh maybe even lower so

635
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,480
near near the absolute zero temperature

636
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,080
and it requires a very dedicated

637
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,720
setup you need to have like a liquid

638
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,279
nitrogen to cool things down to 77k

639
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,360
first and then cool further down with

640
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,400
liquid helium

641
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,440
to 4.2 k that's the natural

642
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,400
uh the just the liquid phase of these

643
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,000
elements naturally at this temperature

644
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,600
but then you can pump your system and

645
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,880
have different phases of your helium and

646
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,400
keep your very bottom part of the

647
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,000
the setup extremely cold so then you can

648
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,159
imagine that this requires a

649
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,799
very careful setup and you don't want

650
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,440
anything

651
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,679
outside this region to come in and mess

652
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,760
up your system

653
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,880
so the electronic control is very

654
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,640
important

655
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,320
our sydney team recently

656
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,039
uh spent a few months published a

657
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,240
control system

658
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,880
they came up with a very very

659
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,559
delicate setup it's basically a control

660
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,120
chip

661
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,679
that you can just have three wires

662
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,720
coming into

663
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,159
your qubit setup and then control a huge

664
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,440
amount of qubits

665
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,000
just using those three wires it's all

666
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,919
online you can read the blogs on

667
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,520
microsoft's website

668
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,880
so it's super cool and

669
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,919
the last thing uh yeah and the other

670
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:28,880
reason that

671
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,520
low temperature is important is also to

672
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:31,919
put

673
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,120
your perhaps superconductors into its

674
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,200
superconducting state

675
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,919
and you can have

676
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,120
a superconductor that

677
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,159
so basically how superconductor it works

678
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:48,960
is like

679
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,440
a normal conductor you will have a

680
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,760
resistance that goes up with temperature

681
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,320
like i mentioned earlier that's the the

682
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
vibration of the

683
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,399
the lattice causes the resistance

684
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,159
but in superconductor you can have a

685
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,520
certain phase transition

686
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,120
at a particular temperature then you can

687
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,840
make your material into a superconductor

688
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,880
so we want that superconducting state

689
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,919
below the nanowires so we need to cool

690
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,360
our system down for the superconductor

691
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,799
to work

692
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,159
usual superconductors have these

693
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,120
cooper pairs where electrons would pair

694
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,679
up

695
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,000
and they would move like a network

696
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,159
without ever bouncing into

697
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,880
the lattices that's how superconductors

698
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,520
are is

699
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,720
very minimal scattering they

700
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,760
they are put into this below the

701
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,279
critical temperature

702
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,200
tc then in the superconducting state

703
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,440
they can form these cooper pairs and

704
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,880
move without

705
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,399
much scattering and this can provide

706
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,520
a protection for your system

707
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,559
because you need a certain amount of

708
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,679
energy in order to break the superpower

709
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,360
cooper pair and put

710
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,799
your superconducting material back into

711
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,799
a normal conducting material

712
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,360
so there is an energy gap that you can

713
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:17,840
use

714
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,039
to to to shield your system so if you

715
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,320
can cool it down

716
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,159
to the superconducting state

717
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,440
then your system is safe from being

718
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,080
scattered

719
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,600
around um so that's also why we need to

720
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,799
cool it down for the topological uh

721
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,799
setup so that's all the basic concept i

722
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,279
want to

723
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,559
want to list all of these uh

724
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,799
ideas come from mathematics i just

725
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,159
turned them into

726
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,320
comics but if you want to look at the

727
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,880
math the actual

728
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,080
review papers these are three very

729
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,240
important foundational papers that

730
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,000
establish these

731
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,880
theoretical construction for a

732
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,080
topological

733
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,760
heterostructure and also

734
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,960
it's very very cool that from

735
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,840
mathematics

736
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,200
we can construct these ideas and then we

737
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,440
try to follow that in the labs try to

738
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,559
recreate it

739
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,720
recreate the math in actual materials

740
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,200
so definitely go take a look there so i

741
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,120
mentioned we have some special events

742
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,399
coming up

743
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,559
in september i am inviting a few

744
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,320
guest lectures and also through

745
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,399
teaching this group there are some

746
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,640
particular topics i know the group is

747
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,240
interested to learn about

748
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,360
and i'm no expert in those particular uh

749
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,960
subjects so i i rather invite

750
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,559
these experts to talk about them

751
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,840
and tarot professor terrell

752
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,480
franz has been coming to our class thank

753
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,600
you for

754
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,399
supporting the quantum computing

755
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,519
education

756
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,720
so he is specializing in quantum

757
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,799
cryptography

758
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,200
so next weekend we're going to have

759
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,919
professor

760
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,840
franz teach us about quantum

761
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,279
cryptography

762
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,320
and then the week after on the 20th

763
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,720
we're lucky to have professor chris

764
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,519
ferry

765
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,880
some of you may have read his book uh

766
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,880
his series of books is one of the most

767
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,840
popular ones is quantum computing for

768
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,559
babies

769
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,240
so we're very happy to have professor

770
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,360
chris ferry to come talk about quantum

771
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,320
tomography

772
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,200
it's a very interesting topic as well

773
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,640
and note the time

774
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,720
change for that one i would repeat this

775
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
next class as well

776
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,000
because chris is in sydney we need to

777
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,679
accommodate his time so

778
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,360
we this normal time will be too early in

779
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,880
their morning we should make sure that

780
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,840
we attend his class a few hours later so

781
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,960
i will announce the

782
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,080
actual time there and

783
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,200
uh just a reminder that

784
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,080
all of the microsoft software

785
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,559
development is open source

786
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,919
and these are our official repositories

787
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,840
you can find this all on our

788
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,039
documentation

789
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,880
it's a reminder that you can now already

790
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,279
participate and contribute to the

791
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,679
official microsoft quantum developments

792
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,480
we have the documentation libraries

793
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,399
catas compilers

794
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,000
runtime iq sharp

795
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,360
exercises that all open source so

796
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,399
you should uh take advantage of

797
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,200
all these great resources out there and

798
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,120
also to remind you that these

799
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,080
are the official microsoft places

800
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
and we also have a great q sharp

801

organization

804
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,080
and a visual site i will actually show

805
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,480
you

806
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,600
their website here is a very great

use their taglines and branding loosely

826
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
q sharp community means q-sharp

827
