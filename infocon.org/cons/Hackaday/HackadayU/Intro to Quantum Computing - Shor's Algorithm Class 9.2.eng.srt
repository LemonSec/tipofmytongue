00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,760
hi everyone

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,880
welcome and welcome back to our quantum

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,120
computing class on sunday

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,480
this is our 18th class and

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,640
also we had some new people come in new

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,080
communities like 10

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,880
sessions ago but every every day every

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,000
time we

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,119
have new people joining us

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,440
so for anyone who missed any previous

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,160
classes don't worry they're all recorded

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,360
they'll post it on hackaday the project

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,879
is called quantum computing through

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,879
comics you should be able to

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,160
find it on hackaday dial and every

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,000
sunday we spend

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,120
30 minutes to an hour depends on

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,280
one concept and we discuss that

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,840
and use the microsoft q sharp

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,719
documentation

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,359
as a guide as well as the quantum

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,000
cutters

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,360
which we use to do coding

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,560
and today is a continuation of last

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,600
week's short class on schwartz algorithm

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,320
we're not doing any coding but i will be

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,320
directing you to some exercise that you

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,799
can do afterwards

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,840
just a quick recap of short's algorithm

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,080
and the problem that is trying to solve

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,159
or the problem that they

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,759
will create is that um the rsa

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,600
encryption scheme that we talked about

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,799
last week

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,520
is based on the fact that classical

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,880
computers are really

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,079
bad at factorizing

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,200
large numbers so our rsa

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,399
encryption is trying to

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,000
use a really large fact a large number

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,439
and then using its factors as

43
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,799
keys private keys but then because the

44
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,680
number is really large is very difficult

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,240
for

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,479
people to break and find out what the

47
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,159
private keys are

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,640
but then schwarz algorithm comes along

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,280
that

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,560
is very very efficient to find

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
these factorized primes

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,040
of a large number so what is

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,239
relying on as we have seen repeatedly in

54
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,319
a lot of quantum algorithms

55
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,920
that is based on again entanglement

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,280
of different states and superposition

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,560
and in this case we also saw

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,599
this new thing i introduced last week

59
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,239
the quantum fourier transform

60
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,760
so basically you

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,440
have a really large number which will

62
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,160
give you

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,440
some other numbers that you can use to

64
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,640
find

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,280
uh using shorts algorithm and then that

66
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,120
breaks the encryption

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,040
so that this is very dangerous if that

68
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,680
actually if we build a quantum computer

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,800
that

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,040
that's able to run schwarz algorithm

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,200
then we need to come up with a better

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
way to encrypt messages and encrypt

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,200
anything so

74
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,360
um it's gonna be a while but we need to

75
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,400
start looking at it

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
and learn to counteract

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,519
so we saw this broad view this

78
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,799
is still a pretty zoomed out circuit

79
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:25,760
diagram of

80
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,200
short's algorithm last time so it

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,080
has some qubits that you want to put

82
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,560
into

83
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,840
oracle and you make them

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
into superposition and you entangle all

85
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,040
of the qubits

86
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,799
and then feed it through the quantum

87
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,239
fourier transform

88
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,519
to obtain a periodicity

89
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,799
of a set of states

90
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,000
and that is a key number

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,760
that would be used in

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,680
basically once you factorize the

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,360
number you get this periodicity r

94
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,599
and i briefly mentioned that this

95
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,439
quantum fourier transform

96
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,959
works just as any fourier transform

97
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,720
and we have this

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,759
actual physics experiment that is

99
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,358
actually demonstrating for your

100
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,880
transform

101
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,880
using a grating that if you shine

102
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,759
a lot of electrons the electron beams

103
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,240
through

104
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,320
a slit grating with many slits

105
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,600
then this is a periodic grating

106
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,240
but if you don't know the periodicity

107
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,639
you can infer that from the interference

108
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,320
pattern that you observe

109
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,680
and that's the basic idea of quantum

110
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,960
fourier transform

111
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,360
so i know for people just joining the

112
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,639
class it might just

113
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,320
sound like too too much already

114
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,720
you can go back to the previous class

115
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,840
which we spent

116
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,320
less than 30 minutes on going through

117
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,120
some of the

118
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,600
these ideas here uh and we're going to

119
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,400
continue

120
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,800
and we're going to zoom into these boxes

121
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,520
to

122
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,880
look at actually how this whole

123
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,600
shores algorithm is set up but we

124
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,320
wouldn't be

125
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
using too much math i'm using these

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,919
graphics to guide people

127
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,120
okay so last time people asked me how

128
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,080
many qubits

129
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,280
would be needed to do the schwarz

130
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,560
algorithm

131
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,199
so i was saying that well i heard

132
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,639
different ideas

133
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
that could that some people said

134
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,199
thousands of cubits some people said

135
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,280
millions and tens of millions of

136
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,000
qubits so how do you even check this

137
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,520
just let's take a real rsa number

138
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,639
as an example and

139
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,199
on wikipedia you can actually find a

140
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,000
list

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,199
of broken

142
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,400
rsa numbers and the simplest one the

143
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
smallest one is this rsa

144
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,440
100 with a hundred decimal digits so

145
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,680
this is an actual a real number that was

146
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,639
used

147
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,720
before it's broken and is this long

148
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
so is a

149
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,240
number that's a multiplication of two

150
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,280
prime numbers

151
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,360
p and q and that's the two numbers that

152
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
you want to know

153
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,240
and people broke it and found out that

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,199
these are the

155
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,720
two numbers that's uh used to make the n

156
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,840
and in reality p and q will be randomly

157
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,039
generated so

158
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,479
random number generators are

159
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,520
oh somebody's asking hence is asking no

160
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
presentation slides

161
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,479
do people see it i think so right

162
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,479
do people see the slides

163
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,080
yeah okay some people are not seeing it

164
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,520
that's weird

165
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,000
most people do so it might be on your

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,560
side

167
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,639
so please check maybe you have to close

168
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,960
teams and and come back yeah thanks for

169
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,199
the confirmation everyone

170
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,400
okay so then these

171
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,440
in reality p and q will be some randomly

172
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,319
generated

173
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,319
numbers and you want it to be really

174
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,520
large and then you can

175
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,240
make up the n so no one would know the

176
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,840
original p and q

177
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,000
are but for this actual number and

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,680
here are the answers and

179
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
if we want to calculate how many

180
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,680
qubits that's needed to run the short

181
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
algorithm to break this end

182
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,039
i quickly did a calculation based on

183
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,400
this

184
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,720
rule here so if you want to inc encode

185
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,319
number of qubits to represent your

186
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,879
input qubits then you need to have 2 to

187
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,360
the number of qubits larger than

188
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,160
n squared and that gives us 690

189
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,919
59 and then you also need some

190
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,199
output qubits that you need to have

191
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,520
two to the number of qubits larger than

192
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,039
n minus one

193
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,120
so then that's 329 in total is about

194
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,919
a thousand but then this is not even

195
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,840
considering any error correction

196
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,039
in so and this is the simplest uh

197
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,520
probably the shortest and smallest n

198
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,599
that's

199
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,039
that's there that's in the list

200
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,360
so for larger numbers of course you need

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,240
more qubits

202
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,958
but we're not even talking about having

203
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,320
additional qubits

204
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,958
to correct the errors that could be

205
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,000
generated

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,519
in your setup so that's why there are

207
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,920
larger numbers and there are orders of

208
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,880
magnitude

209
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,440
larger numbers of qubits needed

210
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,720
theoretically

211
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,920
to run a effective source algorithm

212
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,320
so that's how you can think about this

213
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
how uh how many qubits

214
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,080
will need and then of course you need to

215
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,880
entangle them

216
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,120
so you may need additional qubits to

217
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,000
also

218
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,040
act for that so

219
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,920
just rule some that's a really large

220
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,800
number

221
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
so it's you will be hard to go through

222
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,120
the algorithm with such a big number so

223
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,000
let's

224
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,120
use a much smaller number to look at

225
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,399
how this whole setup works let's take n

226
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,040
equals to 35. is it it's a number that

227
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,320
that we know what p

228
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,360
and q would be but just

229
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,640
imagine that this n is unknown

230
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,839
and you can calculate how many

231
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,200
qubits will be needed and that's 2 to

232
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,920
the 11

233
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,080
which is 2048

234
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,480
and that is larger than uh

235
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
that's larger than this number

236
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,040
so you will need that to to encode

237
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,120
and then you can do a table

238
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,760
truth table that shows you i have this

239
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,320
x and then what is the possible

240
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,440
outcome if i have a guess three here

241
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
three is a guess number you can you can

242
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,720
use any number here

243
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,720
but let's just say that we used 3 then

244
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,000
if you divide 35 by

245
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,640
3 to the power of x you get a reminder

246
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,160
your remainder

247
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,279
in the zero case that will be one

248
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,920
and then uh next one will be three and

249
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,320
nine

250
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
27 but then if you run the table down

251
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,760
you start to see some patterns showing

252
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,720
up so

253
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,560
more than twelve uh

254
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,279
sorry that i think i just misspoke about

255
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,440
this being the number of cubits but 11

256
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,560
is the number of cubits

257
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,920
sorry but this is the number of states

258
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,040
so uh so then you will have this much

259
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,160
number of possible x values

260
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,399
and then you start to see it has these

261
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,120
repeated

262
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,399
remainders showing up so every 12th

263
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,519
time you will get this repeat so one

264
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,640
will repeat

265
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,279
every 12 time 3 will repeat every 12

266
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,079
times

267
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,880
start to see some patterns here but

268
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,440
again

269
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,839
35 is a very small number so we can draw

270
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,880
a table like this

271
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,640
but then if it's really a large number

272
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,360
we can't really do this

273
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,320
so 2048 states will cover

274
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,959
will be the smallest number 11 will be

275
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,880
the smallest number of cubits that you

276
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,279
need

277
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,800
to cover this number here

278
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,519
and then you see this periodicity

279
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,720
starting to show

280
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,000
with 12. so

281
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,120
that i just also already mentioned

282
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,680
that 8 to the power of 0 mod n

283
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,079
3 a is 3 and then

284
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,760
3 to the power of 12 mod 35

285
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,079
they are equal to 1. so these are all

286
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,560
these numbers they're all ones

287
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,440
then you can you can see that if your

288
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,160
remainder

289
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,480
is 1 then a to the power of

290
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,160
r minus 1 should be divisible

291
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,320
by n or you can use another number

292
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,519
another number 3 to the power

293
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,800
of 1

294
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,079
minus 3 should be divisible by n but

295
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,600
here you start to see that

296
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,160
r because r is the periodicity and that

297
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,079
minus 1 should be the smallest number

298
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,200
that is divisible by n

299
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,320
then you can rearrange it this is all

300
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,200
pure math

301
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,519
and some clever trick that has nothing

302
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,639
to do with

303
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,000
quantum and that's how you can even if

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,040
you want to

305
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,360
classically do this you you will go

306
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,639
through this step

307
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,079
so if you want to figure out what is

308
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,399
divisible by n you would

309
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,760
then do some rearrangements so

310
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,200
there's no reason we can't do

311
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,680
make r divide by two and then time the

312
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,959
two back

313
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,480
and then because you can write it this

314
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,399
way you can split it into two terms like

315
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,480
this

316
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,920
and then your r needs to be even because

317
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,120
you have to divide it by two

318
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,399
so and also these two terms cannot be

319
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,839
individually divisible by

320
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,199
n because we already know a to the r

321
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,360
minus one will be the smallest number

322
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,399
that is divisible

323
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,000
by n so this one cannot be independently

324
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,480
divisible by n therefore this one cannot

325
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,920
be independently divisible

326
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,040
by n then you you

327
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,959
start to see okay if the n can be

328
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,560
written by the can be

329
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,680
divisible by two terms then

330
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,800
an n can be a multiplication of p

331
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,639
and q then we can infer p can be

332
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,000
divided by this this term here and

333
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
just doing a calculation you know the

334
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,040
number and

335
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,160
q will be divided by this and you'll get

336
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,719
another number so

337
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,480
what this would be is

338
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,079
a just a clever trick that in order to

339
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:28,560
get

340
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,839
p and q you just need to have the

341
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,519
the grand common divider of this term

342
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,800
and n itself so if you do that

343
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,240
the greatest common common divider for p

344
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,000
you could get a 7 and q it would be 5

345
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and then 5 times 7 is exactly 35.

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,360
so that is kind of a reversible way to

347
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,800
arrive to this stage by looking at the

348
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,279
periodicity in this table

349
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,880
but if you want to look out for a

350
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,560
different type of proof

351
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,639
the video that i recommended last week

352
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,000
also has

353
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,800
a another proof to show that you can do

354
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,760
this

355
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,519
so so far nothing is quantum and

356
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,720
to get to this point 5 and 7

357
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,360
you are doing this greatest common

358
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,560
divider and this can be solved

359
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,120
how do you how do you do this or you do

360
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,079
this in general

361
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,560
this can already be solved by the

362
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,680
euclidean

363
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,440
algorithm that's being invented

364
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,600
thousands of years ago

365
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,880
and it's been used all the time and

366
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,079
you can easily find algorithms that

367
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,480
can do this so it is totally run by

368
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,800
classical algorithm

369
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,880
and the pattern you will see is that if

370
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
you keep subtracting

371
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,399
the the larger number here by the one

372
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,399
you want to get you would

373
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,440
find numbers that are also

374
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,759
divisible by the same common denominator

375
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,040
so that's how you can eventually get to

376
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,880
a very small

377
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,279
number that you know is divisible by

378
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,079
seven

379
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,639
so all of these are commonly used

380
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,399
commonly done

381
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,759
but then the hardest step is really

382
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,839
finding the period r for a large n

383
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,759
we see from this table with a small

384
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,040
number 12 is the answer but then if

385
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,680
n is super big then there's no way you

386
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,320
can

387
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,079
really classically do that that's then

388
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,759
how quantum computing come into rescue

389
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,560
or mess it up by introducing this

390
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,120
very efficient way to get the

391
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,079
periodicity

392
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,240
are and this is how again that

393
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,959
circuit would look and it basically

394
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,720
comes into

395
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,680
three parts

396
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,000
the first step is doing some

397
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,959
superposition

398
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,359
as you have seen in all of these

399
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,599
algorithms quantum algorithms that

400
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,520
we want to put something into um

401
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,319
entanglement so you do a hard mark gate

402
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,439
to all of your

403
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,760
input qubits and then somehow in here

404
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,160
you can entangle them

405
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,319
so let's take a look what's happening

406
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,520
with the aid of

407
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,720
some graphics you have say

408
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,840
quite a few qubits coming in and each of

409
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,240
them

410
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,440
has a number encoded in them and you can

411
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,160
imagine them

412
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,160
as all these amplitudes for your waves

413
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,559
and they're different numbers so you

414
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,120
basically encode all of these numbers

415
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,039
into these amplitudes and then

416
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,520
inside this box here these are the

417
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,559
oracles

418
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,760
that we have seen previously that

419
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,919
has some kind of control based on the

420
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,120
input qubits so what this does

421
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,840
is really to put everything into

422
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,960
superposition

423
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,160
in entanglement you can imagine that in

424
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,280
here the

425
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,240
amplitudes uh the wave would look

426
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,280
something like this

427
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,080
so all of these in superposition and

428
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,559
with

429
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,039
all of the other ones in superposition

430
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,160
and you start to

431
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,280
have these um patterns just like

432
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,919
this table here so all of these are the

433
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,360
peaks

434
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,000
and then again it's showing the same set

435
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,520
of peaks

436
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,480
again it's showing some set of peaks the

437
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,760
periodicity is

438
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,039
r so they're all the same so

439
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,240
this one is the same as this one except

440
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,559
there is a phase difference there's a

441
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,000
phase shift

442
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,799
so when you have a periodic state that

443
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,760
is

444
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,120
f of x equals to f of x plus

445
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,480
r with r being this pitch here

446
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,720
that just says that if you shift it by

447
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,960
amount r you will get exactly the same

448
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,799
uh wave there and the only difference

449
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,520
between them

450
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,520
is this phase vector and you you can see

451
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,559
that

452
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,919
you can actually prove this f

453
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,280
of x equals f of x plus r

454
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,720
to be something with these phase shifts

455
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,080
and their own amplitudes the so so then

456
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,400
you can write out all of these repeated

457
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,520
units and this this n

458
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,160
number n here is just a integer number

459
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,799
so in our case here

460
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,440
is just basically a mathematical

461
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,880
representation of this

462
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,160
set of waves we functions here

463
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,360
so 0 and one are not our two level zero

464
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,400
and one but these

465
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,120
um the x the x zero one two three four

466
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,000
five

467
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,200
uh upon two this q is the very last

468
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,240
number

469
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,039
so i didn't introduce the notation but

470
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,520
don't worry about it it's just

471
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,280
the last number here so

472
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,080
if you want to just write out uh

473
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,440
rigorously what

474
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
comes out of them you will see that they

475
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,080
will have all these phase vectors

476
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,280
the this picture is from the book from

477
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,480
nelson and tron

478
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,280
which i recommend you go to i think with

479
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,600
the

480
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,440
knowledge that you have accumulated

481
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,360
following this class which is kind of a

482
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,679
bridge between

483
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,200
zero to this book so then i think now

484
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,000
this book might be quite useful for you

485
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,280
to continue your

486
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,080
your studying and it's a very good

487
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,440
reference book

488
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,440
also this github

489
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,480
project is a university students project

490
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,960
they also they wrote a algorithm

491
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,799
based on schwarz algorithm they

492
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,559
represented in code so

493
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,400
they're also using this picture here so

494
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
just some references for you

495
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,799
don't worry about too much detail but

496
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,880
then let's see what's next

497
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,880
if you uh then measure

498
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,919
this here measure these output

499
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,679
qubits you don't have to do this

500
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,200
but if you do then you will obtain

501
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,080
things like basically

502
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,200
it would pick out one of

503
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,720
the possible outcomes you could get

504
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,799
a one you could but then if it's one

505
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,200
then

506
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,240
there are multiple contributors if

507
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,360
x could be 0 could be 12 could be 24

508
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,720
so you will get these peaks

509
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,400
with that single amplitude left out

510
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,799
but it's still a periodic wave function

511
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,600
so

512
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,720
that just says if you measure it

513
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,760
all of the other possibilities might

514
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,840
be cancelled out because of the

515
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,960
measurement

516
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,600
and what you're left with is one of them

517
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,520
but it doesn't really change

518
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,200
here you don't have to do the

519
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,360
measurement if you do then you

520
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,120
would feed this wave function into the

521
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,039
quantum fourier transform if you don't

522
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,960
do that you will feed all of these ones

523
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,799
into the quantum fourier transform

524
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,200
but either either way you what you're

525
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,559
trying what you're going to get

526
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,720
is the number are the still periodic

527
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,480
so the next step is to find r as i

528
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,440
showed earlier is like a grating with

529
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,799
the r unknown

530
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,919
but then afterwards you know that

531
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,159
the interference pattern you would get

532
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,159
an interference pattern

533
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,360
and you would know that the pitch

534
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,320
between them

535
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,440
is proportional to one over r

536
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,480
so what this part of circuit for short

537
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,360
algorithm is really to

538
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,960
arrange your numbers into a way

539
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,360
that you can feed into quantum fourier

540
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,240
transform

541
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,480
you're basically letting all of these

542
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,960
possibilities being superposition and

543
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,559
feed all of that into this box here

544
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,760
and then the uh quantum fourier

545
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,400
transform

546
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,520
will just transfer from a r space to a

547
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,000
one

548
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,520
r space that's pretty neat

549
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,480
um of course with a lot of numbers is a

550
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,280
complex

551
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,000
circuit to set up but you can take a

552
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,799
look at

553
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,080
like a three qubit example uh each

554
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,760
is the hard mark but then you

555
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,960
you start to have this control between

556
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,960
different qubits and as gates remember

557
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,279
we we learned about this earlier and

558
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,080
there's the t

559
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,400
gate if you don't remember where they

560
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,120
are

561
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,400
look up on a previous single gate

562
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,200
class but they give you this face

563
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,480
so the integer number of pi over eight

564
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,919
for your gate

565
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,320
so if you want to write out what this

566
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,679
quantum fourier transform

567
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,120
matrix looks like with three qubits you

568
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,520
get

569
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,480
this matrix so you can imagine with a

570
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:18,880
lot

571
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
more numbers you will get all these

572
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,080
subdivision of

573
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,919
faces and they they have some

574
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,440
periodic patterns inside the matrix

575
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,200
itself and this is again taken from

576
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,320
nelson and trunk is a good example in

577
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
the book

578
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
uh if you want to look at a larger

579
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,080
number so basically that's how

580
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,799
how it's done is you have these gates

581
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,320
that are sub

582
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,600
divisions of these

583
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,720
separations and the logic

584
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,919
if you just turn this graphic into this

585
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,320
mathematical representation you start

586
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,000
with some zero state

587
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,400
and then you put the mean superposition

588
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,200
using

589
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,600
the h gates and then apply the oracle

590
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,760
which puts everything into this

591
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,880
periodic arrangement with this

592
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,520
phase difference so then you start to

593
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
see this 2 pi

594
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,039
l in in their case is our n here integer

595
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,720
so pi

596
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,559
x over r and then

597
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,120
this you already see is our very

598
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,720
important factor that has the r

599
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,360
in it if you do a fourier transform of

600
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,559
that

601
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,240
even if you don't think about quantum

602
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,080
fourier transform just normal fourier

603
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,360
transform you will get

604
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,720
something some other function that is

605
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,200
proportional to one over r and then

606
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,279
that's how you can

607
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,279
then be allowed to directly obtain r

608
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,799
is really cool that for me i

609
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,200
i imagine this like in the physical

610
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,840
system

611
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,919
like in the periodic lattice of

612
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,880
a solid state you have all these atoms

613
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,760
in

614
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,679
circle in in the periodic

615
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,880
arrangement and then you can shine light

616
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,840
on it

617
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,440
and all these periodic atoms scatter

618
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,799
your light and then you would get a

619
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,840
interference pattern of the light on

620
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,679
this side

621
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,960
by looking at how these

622
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,559
patterns are arranged and they're also

623
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,000
periodic you can figure

624
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,360
out how your actual material

625
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,640
lattice periodicity is so

626
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,600
thinking about this is exactly the same

627
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,880
this is just a mathematical

628
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,080
representation of

629
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,840
doing a scattering experiment

630
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,799
so that's basically what fourth

631
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,919
algorithm does

632
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,240
if you just look at each step is

633
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,640
actually not that complicated

634
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,440
and another way to think about this here

635
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,039
is

636
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,200
say this is qft and there's a there's a

637
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,640
swing if you're pushing it

638
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,760
at the same frequency as the swing

639
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,840
you will have these amplified you will

640
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,039
have the

641
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,919
amplitude in sync but then if you are

642
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:24,720
out of sync

643
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,240
if you're pushing it at a different

644
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,320
frequency from the spring

645
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,159
from your daily experience it will

646
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,960
gradually the amplitude will cancel out

647
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,640
so what this uh qft is doing is that is

648
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,799
cancelling out all the other ones but

649
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,480
the one that is the correct

650
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,240
periodicity so that's another way to

651
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,399
think about it

652
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,840
so we don't we don't have um much time

653
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,039
to actually do a exercise

654
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,200
but we do have a sample there are not a

655
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,279
lot of schwarz algorithm

656
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,480
code out there but luckily we have one

657
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,520
uh using q sharp

658
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,760
[Music]

659
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,799
so on the github microsoft slash

660
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,039
quantum you'll be able to find our

661
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,640
samples

662
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,360
and i actually have it open here i would

663
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,399
highly recommend

664
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,240
that you go download it

665
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,640
i think working through this in class is

666
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,480
actually not as good as

667
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,360
just looking at it yourself because it's

668
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,120
also

669
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,440
you take you need some time to look

670
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,799
through all of these

671
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,320
and luckily it's all very well annotated

672
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,039
so i would highly recommend that you

673
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:37,919
clone the

674
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,520
samples github repo

675
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,640
and try to look at the shorts algorithm

676
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,760
at your own pace so that's

677
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,320
that's it for today and the interesting

678
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,640
about shorts algorithm is also

679
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,919
you'll be able to learn about some

680
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,960
libraries api libraries

681
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,000
and the numeric library that's available

682
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,039
in q sharp

683
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,200
like you will need the arithmetic

684
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,279
library to arrange your data in a

685
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,840
certain

686
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,279
configuration the quantum field

687
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,799
transform is captured

688
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,760
in the canon library so take a look at

689
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,080
the sample and look at these libraries

690
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,520
i'm sure that would be beneficial so

691
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,640
any questions i can try to answer here

692
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,159
and um i can stay for a couple minutes

693
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,520
but if at any point you have questions

694
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,760
about quantum computing or anything

695
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,559
related to

696
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,279
quantum computing you can post in

697
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,000
hackaday

698
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,039
project page uh all the recordings

699
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,799
including this one and the slides

700
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,000
are on there but you can also look at

701
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,039
the recordings on youtube

702
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,200
and as we discussed last time

703
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,240
next sunday we're going to do a q a on

704
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,120
career in quantum computing i think this

705
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,600
group

706
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,240
wants to probably have some people

707
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,919
interested in drawing quantum

708
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,360
in their full time or doing projects in

709
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,399
quantum

710
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,440
and i can give some ideas of what types

711
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,039
of jobs are

712
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,520
there and what types of skills are

713
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,200
needed in quantum computing

714
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,960
and things like that so we're gonna do a

715
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,320
light light class next week

716
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:32,399
great thanks everyone
