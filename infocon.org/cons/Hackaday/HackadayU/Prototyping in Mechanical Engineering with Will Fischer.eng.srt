00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,960
hi y'all

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,040
will fisher here i'm a mechanical and

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,400
prototyping engineer

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,719
based in berlin germany i have more than

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,800
a decade of engineering experience

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
in medical devices nanotechnology

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,279
semiconductor mechatronics robotics and

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,640
even smart furniture

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,240
and i'm excited to use some of that

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,160
experience to teach

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,760
the basics of mechanical engineering

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,359
through hackaday u

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,680
will cover prototyping and kind of

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,440
prototyping thinking

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,040
then we'll move on to materials and

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,879
material selection we'll talk a little

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,840
bit about

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,920
schematics and schematic designs we'll

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,440
talk about manufacturing techniques that

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,000
you might not

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,399
know so we won't touch so much on 3d

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,840
printing but we'll talk about

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
what to do in the machine shop and some

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,960
other places

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,879
then we'll talk about fluids and fluid

27
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,199
systems pumps valves piping that sort of

28
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,079
stuff

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,079
and finally we'll close it out with kind

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,440
of mechatronic systems

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,960
motors actuation motion gears and so on

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,479
so looking forward to sharing some of

33
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,479
that knowledge with you um

34
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,400
this class is aimed at people who

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,720
already have a technical background

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,560
maybe not within mechanical engineering

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,920
but within

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,840
another technical field so it's good to

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
have a basic uh

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,360
knowledge of physics and some some math

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,280
and we'll build on that

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,960
with mechanical engineering looking

43
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,479
forward to sharing all of this with you

44
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,119
