2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,559
hey everybody

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,040
welcome back this week uh in prototyping

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,400
and mechanical engineering my name is

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,840
will fisher i am

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,320
your engineering guide here uh just to

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,840
reintroduce myself i know it's week

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,760
three probably everyone here has heard

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,920
of the skill before i'm a mechanical

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,760
engineer by training i've spent about 10

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,880
years doing this

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,640
um i work as a freelance mechanical

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,000
engineer right now but i've worked to

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,439
provide you different fields

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,840
and particularly my specialties within

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,719
prototyping

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,719
building things really quickly so today

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,399
we're going to take a look at

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,960
all of fabrication from that lens it

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,120
should be really exciting

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,120
and so let's just hop right in as you

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,800
guys know from the last couple of weeks

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,840
it's gonna be a speedy pace so hold on

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,039
your bridges

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,719
um we're gonna start off of course with

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,879
a movie break i just want to show you

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,559
um a little bit here of

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,960
some really cool stuff i'm like what is

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,600
this thing

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,239
this is a machine that makes paper clips

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,320
um and if you look closely there it's a

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,400
wire vending machine so this is an

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,240
example of a forming machine where it

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
takes extruded metal and

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,280
forms it uh into paper clips and you can

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,680
make

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,600
hundreds of paper clips a minute which

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,280
is just totally cool

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,759
anyway i find that video just wonderful

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,799
so we're going to talk a little bit

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,520
about

42
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,240
fabrication and why it's important so uh

43
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,759
i think that's one of those things that

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,400
uh

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,720
i mean clearly if you are out with the

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,600
goal of

47
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,479
um uh out with the goal of uh

48
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,400
um building stuff sorry i'm looking at

49
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,520
chat oh

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,799
uh audio's a little too quiet uh video

51
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,119
is laggy i'm sorry

52
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,159
uh is the audio any better now uh let me

53
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,399
see if i can turn up

54
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,159
stuff hopefully is that better okay

55
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,200
sorry

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,360
uh okay audio's better now thank you

57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,960
sorry thank you thank you for that

58
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,680
sorry i missed that initially uh anyway

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,560
so we'll just

60
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,159
jump right on in then um so this is

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,680
about fabrication um if you have

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,080
questions

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,598
just make them in the chat i'll answer

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,878
all the questions at the end but i will

65
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,480
i will keep an eyeball on chat as it's

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,440
kind of going

67
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,800
to make sure i'm not missing anything

68
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,959
too crazy um so we're going to talk

69
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,920
about fabrication

70
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,959
building stuff uh making things

71
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,000
getting what you want out of the

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
material you want so a lot of what we

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,640
talked about

74
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,560
last week with respect to materials

75
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,000
we're going to revisit this week as we

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
talk about fabrication because

77
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,599
the reason that i set that up like that

78
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,120
is because fabrication is kind of

79
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,680
fundamentally a material specific thing

80
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,319
um

81
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,840
so uh so we're gonna jump right into

82
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,319
that

83
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,480
i'm gonna divide fabrication into three

84
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,640
categories you could see three big boxes

85
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,720
on your screen right now

86
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,959
you're like well i can count i did it

87
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,879
good work uh we're gonna look into three

88
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,879
different methods one is additive

89
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,040
fabrication that's where you're adding

90
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,800
material onto an existing material to

91
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
get the part you want

92
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,680
3d printing is a really good example of

93
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,040
this

94
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,280
um and there are a couple of others that

95
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,239
we'll go over

96
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,000
subtractive is the opposite of that and

97
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,440
that's where you start with

98
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,920
a uh a specific amount of material you

99
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,599
remove material from it

100
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,000
until you get the part you want um this

101
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,879
is kind of the whittling a stick into

102
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,120
um a thing carving that sort of stuff

103
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,239
we're going to look at that in a

104
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,360
like a way cooler way which is machining

105
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,560
and i'm going to actually spend probably

106
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
the majority of our time

107
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,480
living in subtractive machining land um

108
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,360
finally

109
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,959
forming is kind of the third part of

110
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,080
that that's where you start with a

111
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
certain amount of material

112
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,799
and then you just have the same amount

113
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,959
of material when you end um and that's

114
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,680
uh molding and casting and um and

115
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,440
bending and that sort of stuff even

116
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,159
cutting

117
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,680
in some ways if you're keeping both

118
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,840
parts materials kind of a method of

119
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,480
forming

120
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,239
so we'll talk a little bit about that as

121
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,440
well i'm going to attack that on at the

122
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
end that's a really

123
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,120
important part of fabrication but it's

124
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,680
one that

125
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,239
i'm not going to concentrate on so much

126
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,360
so we're going to go back and look at

127
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,680
this

128
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,519
this that you're seeing in front of you

129
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,159
is a cocktail robot i built in ebrade

130
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,879
uh we built in 2014. but this is the

131
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,959
2015 model that we competed in the san

132
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,799
francisco cocktail robotics grand

133
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,840
challenge inn

134
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,280
um you can see a picture of it right

135
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,879
here on your screen that's it so

136
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,720
31 bottles go on the inside of this

137
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
thing which is a pressure vessel

138
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,079
um and what you can't see is there's

139
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,759
stainless steel tubing going into the

140
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,880
tops of each of those

141
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
that has been bent that's our example of

142
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,919
our formed

143
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,120
thing because we took a thing and we

144
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,520
bent it to be what we want it to be

145
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
um this is the vacuum chuck it holds the

146
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,759
bottom it has a vacuum clump attached to

147
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,680
it holds the bottom of the cup

148
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,199
suction on the bottom so it can move the

149
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,720
cup around without the cup tilting over

150
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,040
so you can see that in action right here

151
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,479
and the grater thing and that was

152
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,639
subtractively machined on a mill

153
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,320
cnc mill and that's how i got those cool

154
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,400
shapes in there the face

155
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
and then i use additive which i consider

156
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,880
welding to be an additive manufacture

157
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,520
fabrication process to weld this

158
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,720
aluminum frame

159
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,000
and so we'll talk a little bit about

160
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,520
welding and welding design actually i'm

161
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,800
going to spend a fair bit of time on

162
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,759
welding

163
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
um as well because i think that's really

164
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,039
important

165
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,400
so that's kind of our basis of

166
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,240
fabrication

167
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,600
and i want to talk a little bit about

168
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,440
what fabrication looks like nowadays

169
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,720
because

170
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,919
cnc the computer numeric control system

171
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,840
is pretty much a game changer for modern

172
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,960
fabrication

173
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,600
in the very old days um you know

174
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
hundreds of years ago

175
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,960
you had to carve everything with a

176
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,919
sharpened knife

177
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,360
or maybe you were chipping things out of

178
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
stone a long long time ago

179
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,240
forging and casting came along i guess

180
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,520
millennia ago but

181
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,680
but they weren't really refined for a

182
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,720
long time

183
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
with the advent of electronic controls

184
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
and electronic um

185
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,720
actuation uh then we could create

186
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,120
fabrication that uses that technology so

187
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,960
while it was invented in the 1940s

188
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,880
it wasn't really practical until the

189
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,000
1970s

190
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,720
and basically any machine shop you go to

191
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,199
uh

192
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,319
right now um

193
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,000
interesting i'm sorry my audio is not

194
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
great i can um i can

195
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
shift over to a different microphone if

196
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,000
we need to um

197
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,440
make sure that's plugged all the way in

198
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,160
and everything um

199
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,759
so uh universal um in the 2000 so

200
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,000
basically any shop you go to nowadays

201
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
pretty much uses cnc machining there are

202
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
a few exceptions to that

203
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,919
but mostly those are people who have

204
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,520
some really cool method

205
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
far in the past like paperclip vending

206
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,400
machine it's not cnc

207
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
uh when you choose your method of

208
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
fabrication this is super important

209
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,280
um you're choosing on a variety of

210
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,560
different things in the same way that

211
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,319
choosing your material was kind of what

212
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,080
we focused on last week

213
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,000
choosing your fabrication method is what

214
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,280
we're going to kind of focus on this

215
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,680
week

216
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
and what i want to do is give you some

217
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,199
practical ideas for some

218
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,680
some common and doable at home

219
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,800
fabrication

220
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,360
that's less common than 3d printing and

221
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,720
i'll explain that a little bit more in a

222
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,800
second i love 3d printing but

223
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,440
you can find that resource elsewhere um

224
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,720
so when you choose your method you

225
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,520
really

226
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,880
you're really thinking about the thing

227
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,479
you want to build and what you need so

228
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,919
as we talked about in the schematics and

229
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,960
drawing section

230
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,639
tolerance matters that's how closely

231
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,000
things fit up

232
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,120
and how things um how things are really

233
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,880
going to fit together

234
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
surface finish may matter for your part

235
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,800
a lot particularly if you have something

236
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,720
that needs to have a nice

237
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,800
fine finish on it in order to spend your

238
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,840
life sanding

239
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,599
that can make a world of difference um

240
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,720
and it's the same thing if you get a

241
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,240
really nice 3d print it doesn't have

242
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,919
really noticeable layer lines but if you

243
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,520
get kind of a creamy one

244
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,360
you might get like boozy stuff that

245
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,120
doesn't look very good

246
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,400
another method another thing that's

247
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,160
really important is speed

248
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,639
um when you're building uh when you're

249
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,560
building something if i can

250
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,880
mill something in 20 minutes that would

251
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,000
take my 3d printer

252
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,560
15 hours to do i'm gonna option my mill

253
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,520
probably

254
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,440
um and the trade-off on that is ease of

255
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
design the nice thing about a 3d printer

256
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,319
is that i can just

257
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,919
drop my my materials my cad file in

258
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,759
some other splicing software puts it all

259
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,280
together i press a button

260
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,800
but it goes and it can print while i'm

261
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
not there which is really nice

262
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
whereas a mill i probably should be

263
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,039
there unless i really trust my

264
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,759
my cnc and i have to spend time tool

265
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,440
passing it so if i'm going to spend 15

266
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,039
hours toolpathing this part doesn't

267
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,800
matter if i can make it 20 minutes

268
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
if i can just print it in 15 hours i

269
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,160
might as well do that

270
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,680
so you want to think about those things

271
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
together what's the combined

272
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,440
um what's the combined

273
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,560
speed of this thing between design

274
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,840
and the speed of actual manufacturing

275
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,679
um so um is my

276
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,799
is my audio okay sorry i'm looking in

277
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,279
the chat

278
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,039
seeing stuff come up there um trying

279
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,959
hopefully it's all right anyway um

280
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,200
i'll just keep trying um so another

281
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,560
thing that's important to think about

282
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,240
um okay cool i've done something just

283
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,360
another thing that's important to think

284
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
about is how much of your how much of

285
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
your part is going to need to vary how

286
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,519
much are you iterating this design

287
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,000
like for example if i need 40 or so of

288
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,120
uh

289
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,440
um we could uh yeah i could do that

290
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,320
um we'll be back for the video there

291
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,839
okay maybe that'll help some

292
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,880
um so i'll be using it again later but

293
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,160
maybe that'll help

294
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,440
might be using a lot of bandwidth here

295
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
even though there's a fiber building

296
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,240
um so so another thing that i want to

297
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,519
think about is how much am i going to

298
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,160
need to purposefully vary something

299
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,240
um where i would need to go back and

300
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,600
redo it a bunch of times

301
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,880
in that case something like 3d printing

302
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,640
might be really nice um

303
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,800
but uh so that's that's an important

304
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,240
thing to consider

305
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,519
um and material viability is

306
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,519
uh really important if i need something

307
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,560
that's gonna be conductive

308
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,880
i can't use plastic uh if i need

309
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,839
something that's gonna be

310
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,680
good at high temperature again it's

311
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,519
probably not going to be ideal

312
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,640
um whereas you know if i need something

313
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,120
that

314
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,399
is going to be non non-electrically

315
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,120
conductive

316
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,279
maybe a 3d printed housing or shell

317
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,839
might be really good

318
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,680
um yeah and the final thing that's

319
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,480
really important is

320
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
what tools do you have available to me

321
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,000
you know like the old expression

322
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,360
if all you've got is a hammer everything

323
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,560
looks like a nail well that's really

324
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,959
true in the fabrication sense as well

325
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,320
part of the reason that i'm i'm going to

326
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,600
talk a lot about machining is because

327
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,120
that's where my expertise is when i

328
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,880
learned to do prototyping

329
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,640
3d printers just weren't all that good

330
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
they existed but either they were very

331
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,519
expensive

332
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,440
uh with resident printers or they just

333
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,120
didn't have the accuracy we needed to do

334
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,560
what we needed to do

335
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,200
and so the machine shop was our our app

336
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,440
was was the only option we had

337
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,720
so when you think about things these are

338
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
just a couple of things you need to

339
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
think about and if you're going to be

340
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,880
farming out your fabrication to

341
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,000
somewhere else

342
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,760
then price is going to start to factor

343
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
in as well and machine shops almost

344
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,040
certainly are going to be more expensive

345
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,959
than a customs reading from the shop

346
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,440
that's just the sad statement though it

347
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
depends again on material

348
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,160
let's talk a little bit about precision

349
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,240
so so we talked about tolerances with

350
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,680
respect to your design

351
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,440
and i just want to take a look at

352
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
precision with respect to different

353
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,120
fabrication methods because different

354
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,000
things

355
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,279
um uh

356
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,160
my microphones on my on my jacket um the

357
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,959
different things have different

358
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,480
fabrication methods

359
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,399
so um with flame cutting that's almost a

360
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,920
hand process where you take a torch and

361
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,279
cut through something

362
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,120
um hand grinding is where you're at a

363
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,399
grinding wheel actually finding

364
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,839
something you can actually get things by

365
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,320
hand

366
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,200
pretty well below millimeter tolerance

367
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,320
kind of by eye

368
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
i want to point out that this line right

369
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,680
here in the center that's about a human

370
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,560
hair's whip

371
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,920
so when you're talking about cnc milling

372
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,200
or cnc turning

373
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,839
you are getting orders of magnitude

374
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:42,640
lower than that

375
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
in the really really fine machining

376
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,920
areas which is so

377
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,640
so so impressive and and when you're

378
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,760
talking about stuff like

379
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,800
grinding like cnc grinding or honing and

380
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,680
laughing

381
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,079
the precision on that is so

382
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,760
preposterously tiny i mean this is two

383
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,720
microns

384
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,000
that's nothing um so that's a really

385
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,040
impressive

386
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,680
uh precision that you can get with some

387
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,760
of these manufacturing protocols

388
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
i mean you can't at least right now you

389
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,040
can't get anywhere close to that

390
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,920
on 3d printing we will talk about a

391
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,360
couple of these non-traditional methods

392
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,160
as well

393
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,360
um actually plasma cutting out is better

394
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,639
than it has been

395
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,360
here i think you could get it into this

396
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,240
area

397
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,399
nowadays it's gotten better um since

398
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,680
this chart came out

399
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,760
um edm we'll talk about we'll go over

400
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,120
those all later

401
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,360
um okay

402
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,959
surface finish is another thing you need

403
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,440
to think about uh when you cut or grind

404
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,519
um you have different surface finishes

405
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
and those are red are measured in what's

406
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,320
called an

407
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,600
average roughness ra roughness average

408
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
and you can get that in microns or if

409
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,720
the worst

410
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,760
unit of all time the micro inch

411
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,440
which is a real unit that i have used in

412
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,959
real life and specified on

413
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,160
real schematic drawings um which is a

414
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,600
millionth of an inch

415
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,040
um and that gives you an idea and i have

416
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,639
these back here so you can get an idea

417
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,279
of kind of

418
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,200
what that finish would be like because

419
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,560
that varies

420
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,880
quite a bit um you know kind of a rough

421
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,600
surface as

422
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,639
machined uh you can get an as machine

423
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,120
surface usually is about that kind of

424
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,800
one micron half a micron area

425
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,920
um and uh

426
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,680
whereas you know if you sanded that you

427
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,320
could get down to a 150 grit

428
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,720
uh or a 320 grit will get you much lower

429
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,079
if you really want a mirror finish you

430
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,279
could take out the polish paper and

431
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,880
really go to town on that

432
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,800
um and so uh yeah so that's

433
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,199
that's kind of that um and you can get

434
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,279
much finer service finishing

435
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,720
with some of these other techniques so

436
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,079
this is something where you might have a

437
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,279
finishing technique

438
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,480
that would come along afterwards

439
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,519
to get you a nicer finish

440
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,839
so that's kind of uh our introduction to

441
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,519
fabrication i really wanted to spend

442
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,120
because i got some feedback last week

443
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,000
that i was

444
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,440
moving very quickly through things i

445
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,240
wanted to make sure that i spent time

446
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,839
diving further into uh specific things

447
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,839
you get a little more value out of that

448
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,760
so i didn't have to hurry myself so i

449
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,440
wanted to move in on that so

450
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
jumping right into additive machine

451
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,959
so i would consider additive machining

452
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,079
out of the manufacturing added

453
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,040
fabrication all of those

454
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,120
kind of thing and that's as i said

455
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,800
before adding stuff

456
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
onto a thing to make your part um

457
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,120
so i did want to cover 3d printing

458
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,600
is really an amazing technology my two

459
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,040
favorite 3d printers are up there right

460
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,320
now mark forge and

461
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,639
form 3 from form labs are ones that i

462
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,880
have here in my co-working space i adore

463
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,079
those 3d printers

464
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,639
and i use those parts all the time they

465
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,279
are just

466
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,800
awesome um and there are a lot of

467
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,439
great at-home 3d printers i have um

468
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,199
3d printer that's a filament printer

469
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,880
that i use it's my personal one

470
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,279
i love 3d printing not here to slam it

471
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,480
but i do want to talk about

472
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,839
uh welding and machining and so we're

473
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,440
going to not talk about 3d printing to

474
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,560
get to that

475
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,839
and there are other additive types of

476
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,680
machining uh that we won't talk about at

477
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,040
all today most of those require high

478
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,240
vacuum and like

479
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,680
tons of infrastructure but really a pain

480
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,399
in the butt um

481
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,920
so let's talk about let's talk about

482
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,680
welding um that's the one that i really

483
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,880
want to talk about because i feel like

484
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,440
there's

485
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,000
there's a lot of designing of larger

486
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,839
systems that require

487
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,000
thinking about welding so i want to talk

488
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,680
about this is the welder right here that

489
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,880
we have here this is

490
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
a stallback 135mm

491
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,079
i actually got it sitting right next to

492
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,839
me over here i wanted to

493
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,920
have my my torch here so i can show you

494
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
just about how big this thing is

495
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,519
um because this is going to be relevant

496
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,199
when we talk about how you design parts

497
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,399
for welding

498
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,759
um so so fundamentally welding is about

499
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,480
using

500
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
in this case heat to join pieces of the

501
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,639
same material with a filler material

502
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,880
in between so um so in this case

503
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,800
uh metal welding is it doesn't

504
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,320
necessarily require that i've got to put

505
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,480
a star next to the ones where that's

506
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
truly the case and i want to talk a

507
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,600
little bit about the other ones and then

508
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
we'll get really into the depth

509
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,160
so you can weld plastics plastics can be

510
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,680
welded ultrasonically which is super

511
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,959
neat they can be welded thermally by

512
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,160
melting them together

513
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,600
and they can be melted they can be

514
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,519
welded chemically there's solvents that

515
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,040
you put in and then they infiltrate

516
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,399
we're not going to talk about that i'm

517
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,519
going to talk about spot welding which

518
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,320
is where you use

519
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,800
electrical resistance to create heat and

520
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,160
you don't you can do it like

521
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,680
immediately that's super cool but we're

522
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,600
not talking about it nor laser or

523
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,720
friction welding

524
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,399
friction welding which mostly happens

525
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,920
accidentally when you don't put oil in

526
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,560
your

527
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,079
internal combustion engine and you weld

528
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,279
your cylinders and place the engine

529
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,160
block

530
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,600
don't do that um makes your inner

531
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,519
mechanical engineer sad

532
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,160
um but i do want to talk about uh meg

533
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,440
and wire feed

534
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,399
tig tungsten and nerf gas um and oxy

535
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,920
acetylene just a tiny bit

536
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,320
and the design for those things um so

537
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
those differ

538
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,519
meg uses a wire feed to push out and

539
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,240
then shields the gas

540
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,760
tungsten inert gas uses a tungsten

541
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,199
electrode with a shield gas and filler

542
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:07,599
rod

543
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,679
and oxy acetylene uses a torch that's

544
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,000
actually got flame coming out of it

545
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,599
and you're going to use filler material

546
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,599
on that so

547
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,520
fundamentally welding is about having a

548
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
heat source i'm going to not talk about

549
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
the oxy torch a little bit here i'm

550
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,480
going to talk about this electrical arc

551
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,919
as my heat source

552
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,799
um and i'm going to use that heat source

553
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,640
i need to shield my molten metal from

554
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,520
oxygen

555
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,280
while the weld is cooling it's really

556
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,640
important because as we talked about

557
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,520
last week

558
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,280
oxygen and the environment will corrode

559
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,799
metals and it does so

560
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,919
at a much much much accelerated rate if

561
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,360
i've got uh my higher temperatures

562
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,550
so that's a temperature

563
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,640
[Music]

564
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,240
it's a temperature dependent process and

565
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,080
so i want to shield it particularly why

566
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,400
my

567
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,799
while my metal is molten and so what i

568
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,400
do i have two ways to do that either i

569
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
can use flux which is a material that

570
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
floats to the surface of the weld pool

571
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,880
hardens and then keeps the oxygen away

572
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,320
from the weld while it's cooling

573
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,160
or the much preferable way to do it is

574
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,000
with uh shield gas

575
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,240
and shield gas is something that

576
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,559
displaces the oxygen around the weld

577
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,280
and fills it in typically with argon or

578
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,000
co2 or a blend of argon and co2

579
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
and those are non-reactive or

580
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,520
potentially even beneficial

581
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,200
the co2 carbon in co2 if i remember

582
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,880
will react with the steel to increase

583
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,120
the strength of the well

584
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,039
and you need to add filler material in

585
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,320
because the heat of this

586
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,960
electrical arc does vaporize some of

587
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,799
your metal as it's molten

588
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,919
and so you need to add additional

589
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,760
material in or you'll burn through melt

590
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,720
away your material

591
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,919
and they'll be left with nothing which

592
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,720
is so sad um and so

593
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,480
uh either you have this wire feed which

594
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,080
you can see in this thing here and

595
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,600
whenever you pull the

596
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,080
trigger on your on your weld gun it

597
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,000
automatically feeds in

598
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
if you have shield gas it'll

599
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,120
automatically open the thing and it'll

600
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,720
automatically turn on the circuit

601
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,640
which makes it just like just so easy

602
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,080
it's like using a hot glue gun but you

603
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,280
don't even have to pump it a bunch of

604
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,840
times

605
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
you just put it down there and all of a

606
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,600
sudden you're flowing liquid metal

607
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,679
it's awesome i highly recommend doing

608
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,720
this at home

609
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,919
um make sure you have the proper

610
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,440
protective equipment which we'll talk

611
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,600
about a little bit later

612
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,000
if you are using a tig machine or an oxy

613
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,720
torch

614
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,559
you'll do that with a filler rod so

615
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,919
you'll actually have a long thin piece

616
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,799
of material

617
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,760
you'll have your shield gas somehow

618
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,200
you'll have those two things and it's a

619
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,720
two-handed process so you've got your

620
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,600
heat source

621
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
typically in your dominant hand and your

622
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,679
filler rod in your offhand

623
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,960
um all of this stuff takes a lot of

624
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,600
dexterity a lot of practice to get right

625
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
i'm a welding instructor as well i

626
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,640
actually taught a welding class earlier

627
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,200
today

628
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,120
um and so i have a lot of practice on

629
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,720
this sort of stuff

630
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,320
so it's quite easy now that i have a lot

631
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,919
of practice but um

632
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,280
in the design stuff which we're going to

633
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
focus on today necessarily how you fill

634
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,000
stuff in

635
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,120
you got to think about this sort of

636
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,559
stuff and that's important because you

637
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,320
need to think about the way things fit

638
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,600
up um and so

639
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,360
uh weld penetration is uh an important

640
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,039
part of your structural capacity if you

641
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,559
have two pieces of six

642
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,640
millimeter thick steel but you're weld

643
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,840
only and you're trying to join them

644
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,280
together but your weld only goes

645
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,840
two millimeters in your part will always

646
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,200
fail at the weakest point

647
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,640
so you're gonna fail along that weld

648
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,679
because you didn't get your weld

649
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,120
penetration deep enough

650
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,000
um most conventional wire feed welders

651
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,360
are going to have a lot of trouble

652
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,120
welding any thinner material than two

653
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,840
millimeters

654
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,520
so it's just going to burn and melt away

655
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,120
so when you design for a welder if

656
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,159
you're using big piece

657
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,440
of tube so like i'm going to

658
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,039
switch my video over here if we could

659
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,320
switch my spotlight to this one

660
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
i've got my my welded component here

661
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,200
we're going to look at a whole bunch of

662
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,120
different parts over the course of today

663
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,840
um but you can see my welds are in here

664
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,720
so this is actually done by a

665
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
professional welder who's ground the

666
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,200
welds back down here um to be flush but

667
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,080
you can see that my

668
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,520
my end material here underneath here

669
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,880
is about uh two millimeters thick and so

670
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,240
i don't want to go much thinner than

671
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,600
that because my i'm gonna have trouble

672
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,760
welding that without burning through

673
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,039
cool that's uh welding i'll stop the

674
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,159
video there

675
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,520
um move that back out of the way um

676
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,440
so that's an important thing so that uh

677
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,000
okay uh that's telling me to unmute

678
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,640
myself but no

679
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,760
you guys can i hope

680
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,120
um you can go a little bit thinner with

681
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,799
tig in fact uh if you're really really

682
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,520
delicate

683
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,679
you can go down sub millimeter it's

684
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,200
tricky and it requires a lot of practice

685
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,320
you're going to burn through a lot of

686
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,080
material first

687
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,600
one of the really important things in

688
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,799
preparing your well if you're going to

689
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,799
do it is to make sure you have extremely

690
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,360
close

691
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,480
fit up between your parts um and that

692
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
is the closer fit up you have if they're

693
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,640
really flush your weld will be much

694
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,600
better

695
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,120
as you have a gap what's going to happen

696
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,480
is your material is going to tend to wet

697
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,320
melt and run away from it

698
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,280
and that's a problem as you design welds

699
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,799
your torch has to fit

700
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,559
physically into the location where

701
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,919
you're putting the welds if you put two

702
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,440
welds super close to each other

703
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,280
in a really deep trench you know i've

704
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,760
got my weld torch here

705
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,559
my welder or me if i'm my welder usually

706
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:06,799
i

707
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,679
am i can't get my torch in there to

708
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,200
wiggle it around so if i put components

709
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
too close together

710
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,919
it's going to be impossible to weld in

711
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,840
any welder where you go and try and get

712
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,480
a quote

713
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,520
on a thing they're going to look at this

714
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,559
and they're going to give you what's

715
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,679
called a no quote

716
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,480
and no quote is when a professional

717
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,919
person who builds stuff looks at your

718
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:24,720
part and says

719
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,880
hey like look this is not a physically i

720
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,000
can't make this part

721
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,559
to your specifications if you get a no

722
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,200
quote

723
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,039
um just kind of as a general rule what i

724
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,840
would say is um

725
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,200
i would i would go back to the

726
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,799
manufacturer and say like look what was

727
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,240
it that caused you to know quote this a

728
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,760
lot of times they may even tell you

729
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,280
up front they'd be like look this trench

730
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,120
is too deep we just can't build that

731
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,880
um or this tolerance is too tight or

732
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,799
whatever if you get a no quote always go

733
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,159
back to the manufacturer and say like

734
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:50,640
okay

735
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,919
how do i fix it and um and and what else

736
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,280
can i do like if this is going to be

737
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,880
super expensive how do i make that

738
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,240
better

739
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,039
um there are different weld sheets um

740
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:01,360
but

741
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,320
all welds basically break down to

742
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,360
functionally

743
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,919
kind of one of three types the butt

744
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,360
joint down here that you can see which

745
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:09,679
is

746
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,799
where i've got two pieces coming

747
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,720
together in the middle

748
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,559
next to each other the lap joint where i

749
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,400
have an overlap

750
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,919
um so called because it's a lap joint

751
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,640
and then this t joint up here and these

752
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,559
other two are basically variants this is

753
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,919
basically above the edge joint is

754
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,280
basically a butt joint

755
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,039
and the corner joint is pretty similar

756
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,559
to a lap joint

757
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,000
um but that t joint is is the hardest to

758
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,559
get a torch in so when you design for

759
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,200
that

760
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,120
think about getting torch access into

761
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,400
your weld point

762
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,640
um the easiest access is always going to

763
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,919
be that butt joint because you can just

764
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,360
come right up to the surface

765
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,279
and get down but when you when you're

766
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,400
designing your weld

767
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,760
think about making sure you can get all

768
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
that stuff that fits in

769
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,360
when you select materials for your weld

770
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,480
if you're going to do it with a simple

771
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,919
wire feed like the one that i've showed

772
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:56,640
you

773
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,080
you really can't do anything other than

774
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,400
mild steel conveniently

775
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,679
it's available you should be able to get

776
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,440
it anywhere you can cut it out of other

777
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,080
stuff

778
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,159
put it together put it back together

779
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,200
super nice

780
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,360
um and so you want to use a mild steel

781
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,480
and by mild i mean

782
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,520
low carbon content um so

783
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,880
like a 10 18 perfect for that

784
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,360
if you want if you need fancier

785
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,080
materials

786
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,760
then you need fancier types of welders

787
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,200
and this is where your tig really comes

788
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,840
in

789
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,080
um for aluminum and stainless you'll

790
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,039
need to have

791
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,240
that uh argon shield gas in place

792
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,760
and with aluminum you have to have an

793
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,279
alternating current welder

794
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,880
um because just the nature of the

795
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,480
electrical process and aluminum you have

796
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,200
to use an ac

797
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,880
welder and so you need to take to do

798
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,400
that you can't do that with the name

799
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,799
uh actually that may not be true there

800
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,240
are some migs nowadays do that but they

801
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,440
tend to be pretty expensive

802
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,880
it may honestly be easier just to get a

803
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,559
take and do it that way

804
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,039
um besides having a tig is really fun if

805
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,559
you want to do this stuff yourself

806
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,679
they're not even that expensive you can

807
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,919
get them for like 500 600 bucks now

808
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,960
it's amazing um and they're pretty good

809
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,240
quality um

810
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,159
stainless you also typically use a tig

811
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,320
you definitely need uh stainless filler

812
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,279
and inert gas when you're doing

813
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,559
one final note on uh welding

814
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,440
uh when you are putting things in place

815
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,600
design places for tack belts to happen

816
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,279
as you're welding this material you're

817
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,720
creating a ton of heat

818
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,880
and what that does is it expands your

819
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,919
material

820
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,679
so um if your material expands you weld

821
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,360
it and then it contracts back as it

822
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,799
cools back down you're gonna get this

823
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,240
warping effect it's gonna

824
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,919
it's gonna cause your material to warp

825
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,440
up and you're gonna get these wrinkles

826
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,799
and these curves and it's gonna just

827
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,000
destroy

828
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,679
potentially really expensive material

829
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,360
that you have

830
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,159
excuse me i've been talking a lot today

831
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,279
and some of it's been in the metal shop

832
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,279
so my voice is kind of shot

833
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,320
um so if you were going to do a a long

834
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,720
weld like this lap joint you would tack

835
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,360
it in multiple locations

836
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,279
so that before you started welding while

837
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,039
the material is all still cold you tack

838
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,480
which i usually say is about a three

839
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,039
second

840
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,880
weld in that location to make sure you

841
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,039
bond those materials pieces together

842
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,880
and then you do your hold weld and what

843
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,120
happens then is as the material heats up

844
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,279
your attacks prevent things from from

845
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,320
shifting around

846
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,679
and when everything contracts back it

847
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,360
goes back to the shaky you're in

848
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,720
so that's really important and as you're

849
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
designing for welds

850
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,559
you also want to take into account that

851
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,480
a welder who's doing this well is going

852
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,240
to have to tack things in place

853
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,919
um as they're welding so just like

854
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,760
understand that if you're gonna be doing

855
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,279
the weld you can always go back and

856
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,760
grind off a bit later um and that's a

857
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,279
pretty good way to get rid of that

858
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,440
if you don't like it so uh i

859
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,120
prepare to put up demo but then i don't

860
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,520
have it i'm sorry um i forgot to say so

861
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,480
we're going to cruise right through that

862
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,240
on the plus side that means we're

863
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,559
moving along uh with a reasonable amount

864
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,000
of time hopefully this pace is a little

865
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,360
bit better

866
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,120
i certainly don't feel like i'm cramming

867
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,880
a whole bunch of material

868
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,240
we'll get right on to subtractive

869
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,760
manufacturing right now so that's what

870
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,400
we've got on

871
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,880
welding and weld design um of course

872
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,159
there's a lot more to it but this is

873
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:58,559
kind of

874
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,039
overview um what i recommend on on a lot

875
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,159
of these things if you're building it

876
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,600
for yourself if you're prototyping go

877
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,799
and build it yourself

878
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,360
try it um and see what see what happens

879
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,279
um with welding always run a test stripe

880
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,720
on sample material before you do to make

881
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,360
sure your welder settings are valid

882
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,200
subtractive manufacturing is where you

883
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,640
start with a large piece of material

884
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,279
maybe this

885
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,600
sometimes is called a billet um or an

886
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,880
indent depending

887
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,080
um stock round stock there's a lot of

888
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,120
different terms for this

889
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,320
big material and then you're going to

890
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
remove that material um

891
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,360
until you have uh until you have

892
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,320
something that you want

893
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,640
so like this here right here is a gear

894
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,480
that's been edm'd that's electro

895
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,159
discharge machining which is super cool

896
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,520
we'll talk about that towards the end of

897
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,559
subtractive

898
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,640
um and it creates this incredibly fine

899
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,760
bur-free part

900
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,120
and it can you can do it on really hard

901
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,240
materials which is neat because you

902
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,559
can't do that elsewhere um but i do want

903
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,000
to spend a fair bit of time talking

904
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,960
about milling

905
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,039
specifically because it's wonderful

906
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,880
we'll get to all of these other ones

907
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,039
um but it's pretty awesome so we're

908
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,399
going to talk about cutting which

909
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,919
milling is

910
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,200
um and um so

911
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,120
this thing is milling is super

912
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
interesting and you differentiate

913
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,679
uh milling from lathing and sawing all

914
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,039
of them are cutting

915
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,360
um which importantly requires the

916
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,200
sectility of the materials so as we were

917
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,080
talking about material

918
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,159
last time metal and plastics both tend

919
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,600
to be pretty sectional and that you can

920
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,440
shave them with a sharpened blade

921
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,120
as you can kind of see here so this is

922
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
actually the an image i've taken from

923
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,000
the mathematical

924
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,760
underpinnings these are two different

925
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,240
theories of um

926
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,919
two different theories of machining and

927
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,240
i want to get a close-up video of this

928
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,799
as we're going um and we'll get to that

929
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,720
in a sec i just want one tiny thing

930
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,039
here milling and drilling you have a

931
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:41,919
piece of

932
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,320
stock that's relatively static and you

933
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,520
have a

934
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,440
blade that is spinning around really

935
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
quick in a circle that's removing

936
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,320
material

937
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,840
lathing on the other hand takes your

938
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,240
stock spins it around really fast and

939
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,520
you have a fixed

940
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,240
cutting implement that cuts against it

941
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,679
and so that's an important distinction

942
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,120
between knowing lathe

943
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,320
and that has really interesting

944
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,640
ramifications in the design also

945
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,320
sawing is much more much much more

946
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,080
reasonable it's teeth that move all the

947
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,520
way through a material

948
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,080
um to reduce to to reduce the material

949
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,799
the tenant

950
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,840
so we're going to have a quick movie

951
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,960
break here um

952
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,559
to watch this which i just think is the

953
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,159
most hypnotizing thing ever

954
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,240
so this is that math this is a cutting

955
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,919
blade moving through

956
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,240
steel so that material on the right hand

957
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,039
side there is steel

958
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,799
um yeah so you could just see it kind of

959
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,159
cutting and you can see this activity of

960
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,520
the material there

961
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,799
there's five minutes of this we're not

962
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:39,840
gonna watch all five minutes because

963
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,440
that's a waste of time

964
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,200
um i see a question already there

965
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,960
already isn't it turning rather than

966
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,080
lathing i use those terms

967
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,440
interchangeably i think there's kind of

968
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,720
semantic differences

969
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,640
uh but yes technically it is the

970
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,840
material that comes off of that i think

971
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,360
this is really funny is called swarf

972
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,480
that's actually the real name for the

973
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:54,960
material

974
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,320
so when you see those curly cues come

975
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,399
off your lathe that's what it's called

976
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,120
it's a real thing

977
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,320
not making it up so the general thinking

978
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,480
when you're doing cnc stuff is that you

979
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,080
have kind of a process flow that looks

980
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,600
like this and this is true for milling

981
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,480
or labing

982
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,520
or turning or

983
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,480
cnc grinding any of these dnc processes

984
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,240
you start with a cad model

985
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,679
then you go into what's called cam

986
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,600
computer-aided manufacturer integrated

987
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,679
machining

988
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,159
and your cam software will output a

989
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,120
post-processed

990
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,039
g-code um this is the same as your

991
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,640
slicing software on a 3d printer if

992
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,240
you're familiar with that

993
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,960
um it's basically compiling a set of

994
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,080
three-dimensional

995
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,200
three-dimensional tool paths into a

996
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,240
coordinate system

997
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,360
that is then parsed by your cnc machine

998
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,000
so you can see that over here so so this

999
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,360
is a

1000
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,480
human-driven process of design tool

1001
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,000
pathing is also a human-driven

1002
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,919
process and it tends it can be quite

1003
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,440
labor-intensive you've already designed

1004
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,080
your part

1005
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,520
but you have to think about how

1006
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,200
everything is going to move through

1007
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,039
i have honestly built parts where i

1008
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,799
spent three hours designing a part

1009
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,000
and 40 hours tool passing it um

1010
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,399
and that i mean this is like seriously

1011
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,760
something that can happen

1012
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,360
afterwards you end up with this g-code

1013
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,960
as you can see it really looks like

1014
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,279
coordinates and and those are these are

1015
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,000
moves so

1016
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,679
so um m6 t1 is a tool change in

1017
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,919
o3 is a spindle spin up in clockwise

1018
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,000
direction which is conventional

1019
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,080
this is showing my z height my rapid

1020
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,480
transfers and then i've got

1021
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,440
my moves at specific feed rates denoted

1022
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,919
by the f

1023
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,279
anyway you don't have to know any of

1024
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,799
that sort of stuff because your post

1025
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,799
processor is handling all of that magic

1026
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,919
for you

1027
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,039
which is super cool um

1028
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,559
when you're milling there are some

1029
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,480
things that are very easy to material

1030
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,960
easy materials to know like aluminum

1031
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,080
some things that are

1032
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,279
hard to to mill like steel and some

1033
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,399
things that are just like

1034
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,840
silly difficult to know like tool steel

1035
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,600
and stainless those are just

1036
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,000
just let let someone else do that sure

1037
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,760
farm that out to another shop

1038
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,440
even mild steel i would maybe it depends

1039
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,200
whether i would want that on my own cnc

1040
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
because because the harder a material is

1041
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,000
to cut

1042
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,720
the more rigid a mill you need to cut it

1043
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,760
and so

1044
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,279
those tend to be much more expensive

1045
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,360
because they require much more material

1046
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,919
to have that rigidity to make sure that

1047
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,760
it's moving properly and much stronger

1048
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,519
actuators to push against

1049
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,919
this cutting implement as it goes so you

1050
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,279
can have you can mill

1051
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,399
aluminum and grass plastics on

1052
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,720
uh much much much less rigid machines

1053
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,440
and that's great

1054
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,519
if that will work for your application

1055
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,120
it's so much easier for you

1056
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,399
and for your machinists to do i also

1057
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,120
want to show

1058
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,600
this part is milled and you can actually

1059
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,440
see what's called witness lines

1060
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,799
on there and that's the path the mill

1061
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,039
took so those are uh microscopic

1062
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:47,760
features

1063
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,799
that create macroscopic visual things so

1064
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,720
that surface is probably very smooth at

1065
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,440
the bottom

1066
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,000
in fact i can i can show you some milled

1067
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,960
parts

1068
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,200
right away show you some milled parts

1069
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,320
over here

1070
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,720
um if we could shift our spotlight back

1071
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,960
over here

1072
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,279
so i've got a clamp that i milled out of

1073
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,399
aluminum

1074
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,039
here um and you can actually see those

1075
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,000
witness lines

1076
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,240
inside there so i bolted this down to my

1077
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,440
mill table and then

1078
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,559
i used my my mill to cut out that so i

1079
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,600
actually want to keep

1080
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,120
looking at that for a second because i

1081
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,120
want to talk about a bit about

1082
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,519
tool access and how i've got tool axes

1083
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,799
so a conventional

1084
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,080
milling bit looks like uh this

1085
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
so this is just a standard this is

1086
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,240
what's called a square end mill

1087
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,760
and it's called that because if we look

1088
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,279
really closely here i hope you guys can

1089
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,000
see that

1090
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,760
the end of it is square and i've got a

1091
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,360
slide that shows this up close so you

1092
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,159
can actually see

1093
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,120
actually you can see it on the slide

1094
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,880
right now so that's a four flute square

1095
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,159
in mill on the slide

1096
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,960
and i've got a two flute right here um

1097
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,880
and i choose my flutes this is kind of

1098
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,399
getting into deeper machining

1099
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,720
for the purposes of chip clearance so

1100
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,320
more flutes will get me a finer surface

1101
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,000
finish but it'll struggle with materials

1102
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,519
that need to have the chips cleared out

1103
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,399
really fast

1104
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,519
like wood or aluminum or plastic so i'll

1105
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,279
get a plenty fine surface finish with a

1106
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,080
2 flute

1107
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,599
on most of my softer materials

1108
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,399
so yeah so then when i'm looking at it

1109
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,320
what i can do is i use multiple tools to

1110
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,560
get the things that i need out of this

1111
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,719
so i'm going to do roughing with a

1112
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,000
relatively large bit

1113
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,280
like this one so i'm going to rough

1114
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,079
around in here and my cnc will control

1115
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:24,879
where my built

1116
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,040
my my material is getting removed and

1117
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
then for finer stuff holes or

1118
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,399
the trenches that i used because i

1119
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,320
actually made this originally out of

1120
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,199
a single material i used a much finer

1121
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,719
end mill and you can get really really

1122
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,320
tiny ones down here

1123
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,560
down to you know this is less this one

1124
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,399
at this end is less than a millimeter in

1125
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,440
diameter

1126
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,760
and so i can get really fine features in

1127
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,800
there

1128
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,480
and this i actually did so i'm showing

1129
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,000
you this all from the top

1130
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
but i actually did this on a five axis

1131
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,839
mill and so i actually milled parts of

1132
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,520
the sides here as well to get my holes

1133
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,040
to line up properly

1134
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,560
for my little clamp um and uh yeah so

1135
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,480
then i and then i put some some screws

1136
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,680
and stuff in there so that i got my own

1137
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,560
little clamp

1138
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,839
and that's actually made so that i can

1139
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,920
clamp another piece of materials this is

1140
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,119
round stock

1141
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,040
this is a brass um easy machining brass

1142
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,320
that i wanted to cut something out of

1143
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,839
this was a failed attempt at cutting the

1144
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,280
part that i needed

1145
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,760
but i needed a way to clamp it in

1146
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
properly to my machine

1147
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,400
so this is the clamp that i built for it

1148
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,160
here

1149
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,599
and now i can't get my clamp open there

1150
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,520
we go um

1151
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,800
so one of the things that's really

1152
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,640
important if i look at this you'll

1153
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,119
notice

1154
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,720
at this part so i'm going to show it as

1155
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,480
close as i can get in there

1156
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,880
that i have relatively sharp corners on

1157
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,640
the edge here where my finger is right

1158
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,599
there

1159
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,200
but i have perfectly rounded shapes on

1160
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,760
the inside and this is really necessary

1161
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,599
and the reason for that is i need my

1162
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,280
spinning tool to have access

1163
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,359
in there and i can't make an internally

1164
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,320
sharp corner

1165
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,400
with a round tool right this is the

1166
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,359
square peg

1167
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,160
round hole phenomenon um but on the

1168
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,720
outside

1169
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,320
i can't because what i can do is i can

1170
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,000
just trace around

1171
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,839
a straight corner and what will happen

1172
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,680
is i'll get a 90 degree angle

1173
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,599
so that means my external shapes are

1174
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,000
arbitrary but my internal shapes must

1175
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,400
have at least some curvature

1176
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,920
and in the next slide i'll talk a little

1177
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,160
bit about that so i'll set that down and

1178
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,839
i just want to say that that you can

1179
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,599
machine very very fine parts so this is

1180
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,839
a gear that i needed a nine tooth bevel

1181
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:22,480
gear

1182
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,040
and i 3d printed one out of resin here

1183
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,800
so that's 3d printed on that form labs

1184
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,440
tool

1185
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,960
and then i machined the same part here

1186
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,320
now i've got in a collet so you can't

1187
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,599
see it because i need to go and do some

1188
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,720
more work on it

1189
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,400
but you can see actually my from a

1190
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,480
precision standpoint my precision is

1191
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,960
actually

1192
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,359
extremely good in fact i probably got

1193
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,040
comparable precision off of that five

1194
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,400
axis machine

1195
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,839
better than i would ever have gotten on

1196
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,599
a filament printer and

1197
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,119
getting close to what i would get on a

1198
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,599
resin printer so pretty impressive stuff

1199
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,880
off of that little machine um which i

1200
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,160
really like

1201
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,520
um so i'll stop my video there um

1202
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,280
and uh one of the things you also want

1203
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,560
to think about before i move on from

1204
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,440
this slide

1205
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,960
um so if we could change my spotlight

1206
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,400
back to my screen share that'd be great

1207
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,240
um

1208
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,520
so people don't have to look at the

1209
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,520
picture of uh me with my

1210
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,160
without hair um so uh

1211
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
spotlight back to back to back to the

1212
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,680
talking knee

1213
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,079
there we go okay thanks um so you see my

1214
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,119
screen share there

1215
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,400
um so here's the four flute end mill um

1216
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,680
and uh this is doing this um so the

1217
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,280
machine that i'm talking about the 5x is

1218
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,560
what's called a pocket nc

1219
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,320
which i really like we have one here

1220
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,160
that i think is just an awesome awesome

1221
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,800
machine one thing that's important when

1222
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
you're clamping

1223
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,160
you need to clamp hard enough that your

1224
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
material doesn't move during machining

1225
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,839
particularly if you're if you cut too

1226
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,040
aggressively your bit will have a

1227
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,240
tendency to

1228
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,040
catch um which can fling your work piece

1229
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,400
off to the side that can be quite

1230
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,359
dangerous

1231
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,599
um so having an enclosed mill is a nice

1232
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,839
thing there if you have it if you don't

1233
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,040
uh that's not ideal um but happens

1234
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,440
you also need to be able to to clamp

1235
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,119
without deforming your material

1236
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,560
so this is not so much a problem if

1237
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,160
you're doing metals but if you're doing

1238
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,920
plastics particularly ones like

1239
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,640
uh teflon teflon deforms a lot and then

1240
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,640
you machine and when you unclamp

1241
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,880
all of your holes go from being circular

1242
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,320
to being elliptical

1243
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
um and so that's really a big pain in

1244
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,160
the butt if you're machining teflon you

1245
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,280
have a very specific

1246
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,119
thing in mind i would not machine teflon

1247
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,960
unless i had a chemical application in

1248
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,359
mind

1249
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,720
so if i was building chemical fats or

1250
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,079
something like that then i do that

1251
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,680
otherwise use delume

1252
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,240
which doesn't have that karma um here is

1253
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,359
a snapped end mill

1254
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,880
if you are a machinist you have snapped

1255
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,720
an end mill this is just the way that it

1256
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,280
is

1257
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,760
um if you cut into material too quickly

1258
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,359
uh if you don't have enough oil in your

1259
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,560
park whatever it is you're going to snap

1260
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,440
spammers

1261
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,839
but very important in your in your

1262
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,119
machining design

1263
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,640
is that you keep track of several of

1264
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,640
these major factors in your design

1265
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,640
so feeds and speeds these you look up in

1266
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,960
a table for your material

1267
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,560
and your material uh will tell you uh

1268
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,920
usually uh surface meters per minute uh

1269
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,880
surface feet per minute and uh inch per

1270
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,040
tooth so cut low chip load

1271
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,320
down here um and uh

1272
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,119
yeah those will those will do it'll tell

1273
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,480
you that it'll tell you

1274
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,640
um a good depth of cut as well a lot of

1275
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,680
times you'll have what's called a

1276
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,200
machinist calculator

1277
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
that tells you all of this stuff as

1278
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,320
you're designing

1279
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,200
important for your design however um is

1280
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
that you maintain a tool aspect ratio of

1281
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,720
four to one and i've got some images on

1282
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,760
the next thing

1283
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,520
um that'll show um

1284
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,640
and that you have your internal thing

1285
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,960
so that your your depth your vertical

1286
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
height to the interior curvature

1287
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,480
is that one to three uh to radius

1288
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,000
um and these slides will be up on the

1289
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,119
project page so you can take a look

1290
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,000
later

1291
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,520
um a movie break i just want to show you

1292
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,880
what a five axis machine can do this is

1293
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,640
not the one i used which is cool

1294
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,160
um so this gives you an idea of that

1295
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,920
tool access so here you've got a five

1296
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,119
axis machine

1297
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,319
um that's moving around um

1298
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,480
and uh so you can see that it's getting

1299
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,640
those really cool chamfered edges off of

1300
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,240
the square end mill which is just super

1301
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,720
neat

1302
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,000
anyway it does this for another five

1303
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,520
minutes we don't need to watch it back

1304
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,079
to what we were working on

1305
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,280
so when i was talking about cutter

1306
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,800
shapes earlier i was talking about the

1307
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,560
square end mill which you can see here

1308
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,240
gives that nice square bottom

1309
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,000
you do want to think about your milling

1310
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,920
design from the side

1311
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,839
um and i think that's really important

1312
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,280
um because that

1313
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,359
that tell that indicates you're going to

1314
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,400
think from from

1315
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,680
two angles you're gonna think from the

1316
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,160
side so if i've got my square in mill

1317
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,160
that it's gonna come in along here

1318
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,920
like i'm seeing here and then from the

1319
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,560
top uh where the axis of rotation of my

1320
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:42,880
mill

1321
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,400
is going to be because that determines

1322
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,839
where i've where i'm forced to have

1323
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,119
those curvatures from the tool

1324
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,400
rotation um so from the side you've got

1325
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,079
a whole bunch of different options

1326
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,000
uh the square end the ball end the

1327
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,359
rounded edge which is also sometimes

1328
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,880
called a bull nose

1329
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,079
um which is uh confusing when you have a

1330
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,040
bull end mill and a ball end mill be

1331
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,200
careful i've made that mistake before

1332
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
it's a real pain these are some less

1333
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,640
common ones that you see around

1334
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,800
chamfer is pretty common but slitting

1335
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,839
and key seat

1336
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,480
are relatively uncommon dovetails and

1337
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,560
t-slots those are pretty convenient if

1338
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,200
you need to have

1339
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,040
undercut features and i'll talk about

1340
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,319
that a little bit more in a second

1341
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,760
corner rounding are fairly common

1342
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
the ones over here are really pretty

1343
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
uncommon

1344
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,920
um so let's talk about some of your

1345
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,359
design stuff here

1346
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,880
um this is a great way to design for

1347
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,520
melon

1348
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,040
you'll notice that my features don't

1349
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,440
have any overhangs i have my aspect

1350
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,240
ratio is

1351
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,839
is good in such a way um that i can get

1352
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,160
good amounts of tooling in there and my

1353
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,880
minimum

1354
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,720
my minimum feature size down here is

1355
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,480
pretty big and i've still got at least

1356
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,240
that four to one aspect ratio meaning

1357
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,839
that this feature

1358
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,200
thickness between here

1359
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,240
is not uh less than four

1360
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,960
times the height of this feature right

1361
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,000
because that determines the

1362
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,920
size of bit that i could fit in there if

1363
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,119
i get more than that then i would have a

1364
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,960
tendency to snap bits

1365
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,839
and i can have through holes in milled

1366
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,359
parts that's allowed

1367
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,760
i can do that which is really nice this

1368
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,720
part is

1369
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,040
a trickier part to manufacture still

1370
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,960
doable my aspect ratios are still all

1371
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,160
okay but you'll notice that i've got

1372
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,599
this undercut here

1373
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,040
and i could do that with a key seat

1374
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,880
router or key seat cutter

1375
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,520
um but that's a big pain and it's hard

1376
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,800
to line that up and i'm gonna have

1377
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,480
trouble getting everything in here to

1378
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,000
match up and have a smooth bottom on

1379
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,800
that thing

1380
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,880
even with the cnc i'm going to have a

1381
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,720
tiny gap where i didn't worry where i

1382
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,240
had zeroing issues

1383
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,240
on that this part is literally

1384
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,800
impossible to make on a mill

1385
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,680
because i have a very deep undercut here

1386
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,119
and i don't have the tool access to get

1387
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,720
it from the bottom side and my bottom

1388
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,520
side so

1389
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,359
so at the very best i would have to

1390
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,720
machine in from this side

1391
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,800
and this side i'd have to clamp it twice

1392
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,400
trying to make my features match up that

1393
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,680
is a huge pain in the butt

1394
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,680
and even so i don't have any way to get

1395
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,280
any tooling into this space

1396
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,640
so i don't have any access from this

1397
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,440
side so we'll talk about it here

1398
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,599
as well another set of things here i'm

1399
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,680
doing like i said before my two sided

1400
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,040
machining features

1401
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,400
if i'm putting features on two different

1402
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,720
sides curved surface something like that

1403
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,079
that makes it just harder for me to

1404
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,640
clamp it because now i have to orient

1405
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
one side machine and flip it over and

1406
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,079
orient another side

1407
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,119
so i'm going to lose track of my

1408
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,880
orientation between those two sides and

1409
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,720
if i want features to match up

1410
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,560
then it's going to be really uh really

1411
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
difficult um and i'd rather not i'd

1412
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,240
rather be able to mill it at one single

1413
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,440
clamping session

1414
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,319
all from one get go like my hooray over

1415
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,359
here

1416
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,079
um this is possible this part over here

1417
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,920
but i have think about how many places i

1418
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,440
would have to machine this part from

1419
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,800
so i'm gonna have to drill a hole in

1420
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,960
here i'm gonna mill this here i've got

1421
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,200
an

1422
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,800
undercut here where i need to use a key

1423
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,720
seat and then i have to clamp over on

1424
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,599
this side

1425
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,680
to do over here i have to clamp again

1426
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,119
over on this side

1427
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,359
to get that feature in there as well

1428
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,359
right that is a big pain in the butt

1429
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,400
to make that part so if you can avoid

1430
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,599
designing like that

1431
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,960
if possible all right well that's what

1432
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,000
we've got for milling

1433
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,760
um and i do want to move along i notice

1434
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,440
i'm 45 minutes into my hour class and i

1435
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,880
got a lot more to cover

1436
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,760
um but i wanted to get deep into design

1437
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,280
for milled parts because i think that's

1438
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,960
something that's really important

1439
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,000
um lathing has very similar constraints

1440
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,800
to milling

1441
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,480
in terms of tool access in terms of

1442
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,720
constant things but it's really nice for

1443
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,480
some things that milling doesn't do very

1444
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:30,960
well

1445
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,960
it's excellent for high co highly

1446
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,079
concentric parts

1447
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,359
if you need a shaft that's going to

1448
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,839
rotate at high rpms don't mill that

1449
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:38,720
please

1450
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,119
um put that on a lathe the lathe is

1451
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,319
already turning that

1452
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,839
and so you're guaranteed to get that

1453
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,000
really nice concentricity assuming that

1454
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,680
your lathe is dialed in properly if you

1455
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,720
have a nice enough blade

1456
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,560
it'll be like that assuming your run out

1457
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,000
isn't too bad

1458
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,160
um in the case of lathing you want to

1459
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,920
design your part from the center plane

1460
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,240
so

1461
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,440
section through your part um on the axis

1462
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,720
of rotation

1463
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,280
and then design that way um because

1464
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,560
that's where you're going to have tool

1465
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,040
access

1466
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,200
you can do interior cuts with lathes and

1467
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,400
you can use what's called a grooving

1468
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,240
tool to even get those undercuts

1469
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,599
in there and i want to show you kind of

1470
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,119
what a lathe looks like in case you

1471
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:13,920
haven't seen one

1472
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,640
just a really fast video here of how a

1473
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,319
lathe is doing this so you see that my

1474
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,240
part here is spinning around and i've

1475
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,760
just got a cutting tool that's

1476
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,240
static relative to the rotation of the

1477
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,359
motion

1478
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,760
and so that thing in there is going like

1479
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,400
that and so i can cut that

1480
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,319
um and get that nice smooth finish

1481
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,000
lathing can get much finer surface

1482
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,480
finish

1483
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,319
than milling can because you can move

1484
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,480
that cutting tool over a very very very

1485
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,760
gradual bit so you get

1486
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,160
extremely nice surface finish on your

1487
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,040
lathe

1488
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,119
um when you're doing um doing lathe work

1489
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,280
um you can do really cool concentric

1490
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,800
stuff by using your tail stock you can

1491
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,480
put most tail stocks will have a drill

1492
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,079
bit thing so you can put a thing in

1493
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,599
there so you can drill in you can

1494
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:56,640
chamfer those corners

1495
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,200
and get really nice parts out of that um

1496
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,960
you've got this cross slide which moves

1497
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,319
in and out

1498
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,560
to set your tool depth this is a manual

1499
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,440
lathe honestly

1500
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,880
if i'm putting together a shop from the

1501
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,720
ground up i get a cnc mill

1502
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,640
and a manual lathe because there are

1503
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,560
very few

1504
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,240
parts where you can't do it manually on

1505
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,400
the lathe where you would want a cnc

1506
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,480
unless you're doing really cool like

1507
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,240
curved surfaces and stuff

1508
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,040
i do i i don't know for functional stuff

1509
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,240
for engineering parts

1510
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,000
it's rare that i would want a cnc lathe

1511
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,760
unless i'm doing high throughput

1512
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,280
in which case i would probably farm that

1513
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,760
out to a shop

1514
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
okay uh we had our optional movie break

1515
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,640
that was the one i just showed

1516
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,119
with lathing there your trucking is

1517
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:39,920
really important

1518
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,880
you're going to chuck a piece of

1519
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,480
cylindrical material into this three

1520
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,160
draw truck you can also do hexagonal

1521
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,119
material

1522
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,800
um with your four jaw chuck you can

1523
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,240
chuck all sorts of crazy stuff

1524
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,920
which is great fun but you can end up

1525
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,440
with circular shapes out the back anyway

1526
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,560
because you're spinning it around really

1527
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,800
fast that's just the nature of it

1528
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,119
but if you want to start with uh square

1529
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,960
stock you can make your square

1530
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,359
peg into a round bag for your round hole

1531
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,160
in your square

1532
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,680
i i've just confused myself um

1533
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,760
here's the higher order cnc so before i

1534
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,040
saw in chat um

1535
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,480
the five axis that i was using is

1536
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,400
actually this little pocket in c

1537
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,960
it's great it cuts brass and aluminum

1538
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,520
it's not

1539
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,599
perfect um but it's really cool it's

1540
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:18,960
built off i think it's built off a

1541
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,319
beaglebone on the inside

1542
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,160
and it has a web browser that you just

1543
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,040
upload via usb to so it hosts a fake web

1544
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,599
server

1545
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,839
super neat super easy to use it comes

1546
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,359
with a little clamp that is just

1547
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,599
terrible um and i recommend bolting your

1548
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,280
parts all the way into it

1549
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,400
for that but you can get some really

1550
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,000
nice parts out of it so this gear that i

1551
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
was showing you earlier is from that

1552
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,119
tool they are a big pain to program

1553
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,920
5-axis programming like i use fusion 360

1554
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,040
both for my cad

1555
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,280
and for my cam it's nice it's integrated

1556
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,040
and it takes into account part changes

1557
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,240
in my cam

1558
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,119
man that little gear took me probably 40

1559
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,480
hours of programming

1560
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,319
to get it to cut at where i wanted it to

1561
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,240
but i was able to cut the same part

1562
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,760
um out of i was able to cut the same

1563
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,400
part out of

1564
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,480
uh brass which is amazing because you

1565
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,920
can actually get like really functional

1566
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,200
parts out of it you know i needed to

1567
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,000
lift a bed

1568
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,079
and so i was shut shedding teeth off of

1569
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,280
my 3d printed gears

1570
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,680
but then the brass part uh would have

1571
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,760
worked if the company hadn't dissolved

1572
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,119
uh i'm not bitter um

1573
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,480
uh so many of the same design

1574
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,160
constraints apply that you would have in

1575
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,520
your three axis manufacturing

1576
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,119
your three axis milling to your five

1577
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,559
axis um

1578
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:27,839
but the nice thing is you have tool

1579
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,200
access from multiple different sides

1580
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,119
which is really cool

1581
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,160
sawing is a whole field in itself there

1582
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,760
are just a jillion different types of

1583
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,480
saws

1584
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,240
circular saws are really common out

1585
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,599
there table saws are really common

1586
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,599
jigsaws are really nice those are all

1587
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,680
wonderful to have if i'm going to put

1588
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,800
together a shop from

1589
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,720
from the ground up um first one i'm

1590
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,400
going to buy is a vertical band saw like

1591
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,480
shown here

1592
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,520
um and uh that's nice for cutting down

1593
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,040
pieces but i can also do some delicate

1594
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,760
work general

1595
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,319
general uh theory on a bandsaw is you

1596
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,079
should have six to eight teeth engaged

1597
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,520
in your material thickness with a very

1598
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,079
thin material

1599
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,680
use fine teeth your very thick material

1600
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,119
use thick teeth

1601
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,359
like wide teeth spacing horizontal

1602
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,640
bandsaw is nice because you can put your

1603
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,000
material in you can set it going and you

1604
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,280
can walk away and you get a very nice

1605
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,160
clean cut

1606
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,520
they tend to be pretty expensive it

1607
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,559
wouldn't be my first choice to have in

1608
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:15,839
my own shop though i would always love

1609
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,839
to have one

1610
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,760
a miter saw is really nice you can cut

1611
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,200
it with aluminum um

1612
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,480
if you have a really strong one you can

1613
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,480
use a grinding attachment for steel

1614
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,119
which is awesome but it's also nice

1615
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,480
because it guarantees you getting these

1616
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,720
really nice clean 90 degree angles

1617
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,680
if you're going to be doing a lot of

1618
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,280
welding i definitely would recommend a

1619
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,559
miter saw over

1620
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,040
a bandsaw or horizontal band saw if

1621
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:37,839
you're going to be doing a lot of

1622
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,040
machining

1623
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,119
i might think about the horizontal and

1624
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,559
if you're just doing a general purpose

1625
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,000
stuff that vertical band saw is really

1626
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,720
nice to have grinding is really

1627
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,760
important also

1628
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,400
um it's necessary for fit up and for

1629
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,520
finishing your welds

1630
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,160
an angle grinder is i think an awesome

1631
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,040
tool to have

1632
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,280
i have one i love it if you get the

1633
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,720
chance go cordless

1634
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,079
they're just easier to deal with without

1635
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,760
the cord um

1636
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,760
but if you're looking for a bargain you

1637
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,839
can get a corded angle grinder for 30 40

1638
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:06,400
bucks

1639
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,720
it's a great deal fantastic deal a bench

1640
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,000
grinder is another really nice one to

1641
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,640
have

1642
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,000
particularly if you're doing machining

1643
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,359
it's nice to go back afterwards in the

1644
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:13,920
machine

1645
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,079
and to take off machined burrs with that

1646
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:16,960
bench grinder

1647
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,400
this one that i've showed also has a

1648
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,000
belt sander on it which is a nice

1649
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,760
bonus so what i would do is i would get

1650
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,200
something like this that's half grinder

1651
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,000
half sander

1652
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,520
and then you get both covered it's the

1653
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,119
same thing taking up a small footprint

1654
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,319
in your shop

1655
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,119
um cnc grinding is a thing uh you are

1656
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,640
never going to do that at home

1657
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,800
um but if you if you need an extremely

1658
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,079
fine

1659
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,839
the finest the best tolerance of any

1660
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,440
conventional machining

1661
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,640
um you can get is cnc grinding

1662
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,520
i mean it's unreal the quality of stuff

1663
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,200
and they can do basically any materials

1664
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,480
so if you need machined

1665
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,359
ceramics you can get them custom ground

1666
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,720
and that is

1667
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,119
ludicrously expensive but very cool um

1668
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,720
yeah they can get the that precision

1669
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,680
down to like

1670
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,079
you know micron of single micron level

1671
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:01,119
which is incredible

1672
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,880
um polishing is also a type of grinding

1673
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,160
and you can get optical clarity out of

1674
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,359
it you can get optical clarity out of

1675
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,839
cnc grinding as well the cnc grind

1676
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:12,640
optics for telescopes which is awesome

1677
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,640
um i want to talk briefly about other

1678
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,359
subtractive manufacturing methods

1679
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,040
um electro discharge machining which i

1680
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,800
alluded to earlier is this one right

1681
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,319
here you can see there's a big pool of

1682
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,240
water in there which actually they use

1683
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,839
deionized water which is

1684
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,359
has all the ions taken out of it so it's

1685
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,119
not conductive which is super cool and

1686
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,119
then it's what's called spark machining

1687
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,800
and so what they do is they run a bunch

1688
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,640
of current through and the spark ablates

1689
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,680
material off

1690
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,280
and the cool thing about edm is that it

1691
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,200
leaves absolutely no burr even on

1692
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,880
extremely hard materials

1693
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,040
so you can edm stuff like tool steel and

1694
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,920
stainless steel

1695
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,760
and not leave a burr so a lot of times

1696
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,520
this is used in gears and stuff that go

1697
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,240
into cars

1698
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,520
because you can cut out these beautiful

1699
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,920
perfect shapes and it tends to be used

1700
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,200
for cutouts though it can do

1701
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,559
three-dimensional stuff

1702
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,440
as well with cnc plasma cutting is

1703
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,960
another really cool one there you're

1704
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,480
rapidly oxidizing through

1705
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,240
a piece of metal um so you need a

1706
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,240
conductive material and it cuts

1707
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,079
extremely fast you can get arbitrary

1708
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,520
two-dimensional shapes

1709
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,599
beautifully but it's a through cut same

1710
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,960
thing with laser cutting it's also a

1711
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,079
through cut you can

1712
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,839
you can laser cut a variety of materials

1713
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,839
but for metals um it's you're probably

1714
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:16,880
going to be shopping that out because

1715
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,760
you need a big

1716
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,599
powerful laser to cut through metals but

1717
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,200
you get really nice cuts

1718
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,319
um and if they've dialed in their

1719
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,240
process right there's no bur on that

1720
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:24,880
either

1721
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,960
you will get a bit of a burr slag

1722
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,000
actually technically

1723
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,240
off of a plasma cut water jet cutting is

1724
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,520
another really brilliant one water jet

1725
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,520
cutting will literally cut any material

1726
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,599
it's so cool they actually put little

1727
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,359
pieces of what they call garnet into it

1728
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:38,800
it's not actually garnet it's just like

1729
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,480
a grinding abrasive material

1730
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,400
and then they fire out through a nozzle

1731
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,760
at an extremely high pressure

1732
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,280
and it'll cut through granite it'll cut

1733
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,880
through steel it'll cut through anything

1734
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,359
again you only get a two um a 2d shape

1735
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,160
and your

1736
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,280
your thickness is relatively limited but

1737
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,359
the cuts that come off water jet cuts

1738
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,559
are magnificent they're just perfect so

1739
00:52:58,559 --> 00:52:59,280
if you

1740
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,119
have money to throw at your project and

1741
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,280
you want just gorgeously made parts

1742
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,119
um i would look into one of those

1743
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,640
manufacturing methods and i would farm

1744
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,480
that out to a local shop

1745
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,559
and if i were going to do that i might

1746
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,319
even before i started designing

1747
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,920
if you know you want to use a specific

1748
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,599
fabrication method go and talk to the

1749
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,599
machinist that's going to be doing this

1750
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,200
uh for you and say look like what are

1751
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,880
the design constraints what's going to

1752
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,880
make your life easier what can i do

1753
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,920
how thick a material can use so

1754
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,599
cool so that's subtractive i want to

1755
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,200
touch on forming

1756
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,640
as well and then i'm going to talk us

1757
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,040
through 12 tools to own

1758
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,280
um so we're gonna we do have to pick up

1759
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,160
the pace again

1760
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,599
but i'm glad i got to slow down a little

1761
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,280
bit on that sort of stuff forming is

1762
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,119
something that can be done at home

1763
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,640
in some cases and should not be done at

1764
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,480
home in other cases um

1765
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,720
so shearing is an easy one uh like if

1766
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,520
you're cutting metal

1767
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,880
that technically you're reforming it

1768
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,559
from one piece into two pieces

1769
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,760
um punching similarly uh you can press

1770
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,520
stuff you could even hammer stuff into a

1771
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,800
mold kind of old-fashioned way that's

1772
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,640
how they make uh i think that's how they

1773
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,440
still make

1774
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,480
symbols for uh drummers um

1775
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,839
bending is something you can also do at

1776
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,119
home i'll show you a little bit about

1777
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,640
that casting and molding i'll talk about

1778
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,240
each of those

1779
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,000
probably not for at home is forging the

1780
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,280
fusion bonding and i'll talk about those

1781
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,240
also

1782
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,160
uh so shearing punching and bending you

1783
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,440
can all do at home

1784
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,000
uh shearing uh you can do either with

1785
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,359
these nice automated shears if you're

1786
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,839
doing sheet metal that'll do up to

1787
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,760
a millimeter maybe two millimeters of

1788
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,280
steel you could just

1789
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,960
and it cuts a center piece out so that's

1790
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,640
got this little tool thing that kind of

1791
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,839
like wiggles around

1792
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,480
and it uh it removes material from the

1793
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,000
center which keeps you from deforming

1794
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,359
the edge of the material you're doing

1795
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:36,480
it's nice if you're gonna go back and

1796
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,400
weld sheet metal um

1797
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,079
you can also use hand shears those do

1798
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,599
deform the edges and so you get this

1799
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:42,799
kind of crazy bend

1800
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,559
but it's a whole heck of a lot cheaper

1801
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,000
and it's a lot easier to just bust that

1802
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,760
out so i'm going to plug something in

1803
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,920
if you're going to bend metal uh which i

1804
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,359
highly recommend it's a great fun

1805
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,200
thing to know you can actually create

1806
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,960
these little posts for yourself what i

1807
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,559
would do is if i have my welder

1808
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,240
i'm going to weld two posts to a steel

1809
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,640
plate and if i need a specific radius

1810
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,000
i'm going to weld the tube of that

1811
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,559
radius

1812
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,119
on and then another two with that radius

1813
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,480
and then i can just

1814
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,839
make sure i have that perfect thing

1815
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,680
every time uh you can get a lot of

1816
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,200
punching stuff at home nowadays

1817
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,520
if you're doing light material uh

1818
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,640
leather or

1819
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,119
uh even aluminum uh you can get steel

1820
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,880
punching stuff if you have a big arbor

1821
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,720
press pressed press it through

1822
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,160
an arbor press that's just a big piece

1823
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,920
of thing with a gearing reduction allows

1824
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,040
you to crank it

1825
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,119
um injection molding is a form of

1826
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,040
forming you're molding stuff

1827
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,400
it's not something you can realistically

1828
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,839
do at home because it requires extremely

1829
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,599
high pressures going into a mold

1830
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,880
i'm not going to talk too much about

1831
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,240
injection mold design because it's not

1832
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,680
my specialty

1833
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,119
and i don't know a whole lot about it

1834
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,480
but i just wanted to show you kind of

1835
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,160
what that system looks like

1836
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,280
here you can do hand molding so

1837
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,280
actually i'm doing that a fair bit these

1838
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,760
days where i will 3d print a mold

1839
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,480
then take a moldable silicone rubber

1840
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,280
coat it

1841
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,280
then cut it open and then i can mold

1842
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,400
other stuff inside

1843
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,240
or i can 3d print something that i want

1844
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,760
to be made out of silicone later

1845
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,920
and do basically any thermoset inside of

1846
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,000
that which is cool

1847
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,280
and you get some really cool stuff like

1848
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,520
that and you can even do low temperature

1849
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,280
thermoplastics including

1850
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,520
uh you can do there's some very low

1851
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,359
melting point metals that you can melt

1852
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,000
that you can melt inside of silicone

1853
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,280
woods metal is one of them which is a

1854
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,160
gallium alloy definitely don't drink it

1855
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,359
handle it with caution because it'll

1856
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,280
seep through your skin

1857
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,440
but but you can get it and get metal

1858
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,000
parts cast in silicone molds which is

1859
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,040
super cool

1860
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,559
um i do want to talk a little bit about

1861
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,240
casting sand casting is something that's

1862
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,839
also available for you at home

1863
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,200
lead you can melt with a conventional

1864
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,040
blow torch so if you want to make

1865
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,680
lead stuff i have done this with uh

1866
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,280
radiation shielding i have to make for

1867
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,240
my job at once i've had a cool life um

1868
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,680
you can also do it with you can also

1869
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,160
sand cast aluminum um if you have a hot

1870
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,720
enough

1871
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,400
kiln or forage at home that'll let you

1872
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,720
melt aluminum uh which you can do with a

1873
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,160
carbon arc forge there's some youtube

1874
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,440
videos out there that'll teach you that

1875
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:55,839
stuff

1876
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,079
it's kind of insane and really awesome

1877
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,920
the way sand casting works is you build

1878
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,640
um you build basically a sand castle

1879
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,839
around your stuff

1880
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,839
you create a part that you want to

1881
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,000
replicate and you pack in the sand and

1882
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,760
then you take it open you open it

1883
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,359
you pull your part out and you pour

1884
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,040
molten whatever it is in there

1885
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,720
and then you get your part back out

1886
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,760
which you can kind of see in there you

1887
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,440
can also do plaster casting

1888
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,680
there's definitely 3d printed burnout

1889
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,119
filaments and resins you can get so you

1890
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,559
can 3d print a thing

1891
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,440
plaster cast over it burn it out in an

1892
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,559
oven and then cast

1893
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,920
stuff in there uh forming that's the

1894
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,440
stuff you shouldn't do at home forging

1895
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,520
typically requires a forge this is a

1896
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,000
drop forge um so it's taking a piece of

1897
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,920
a hot billet and cranking it into

1898
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,520
something like a bolt

1899
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,119
diffusion bonding is a really cool thing

1900
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,880
where you put something in vacuum

1901
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,559
at very high temperature and apply a lot

1902
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,400
of pressure at the same time

1903
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,240
and it gradually the grains seep into

1904
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,760
each other and it comes out as a single

1905
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,200
formed piece

1906
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,280
just a neat method not much about that

1907
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,799
other than that okay cool

1908
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:57,119
i've got two minutes to go through my

1909
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,200
list of 12 tools to own

1910
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,599
uh so i do want to hop in on that um

1911
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,960
we're gonna go back

1912
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,520
uh well i'm not gonna show you i've got

1913
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,040
all of these i have sat on my desk so i

1914
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,880
could show you um in frames you can see

1915
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,000
a little tiny video of me you're going

1916
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,520
to see me pick up each of these things

1917
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,480
very excitedly

1918
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,920
because i love them that's me looking

1919
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,520
really excited

1920
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,000
tools to own i am trolling myself why

1921
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,520
did i do this to me

1922
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,640
um okay my number one favoritest tool of

1923
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,599
all time

1924
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,319
is the standard single edge razer blade

1925
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:26,880
i just

1926
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,880
love this tool you get good leverage

1927
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,119
with it they come in 100 packs for eight

1928
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:31,760
bucks

1929
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,240
they're sharp as heck um and you can do

1930
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,520
all sorts of stuff with them other

1931
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,000
people like

1932
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,559
scalpels um exacto knives that sort of

1933
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,000
stuff but a blade

1934
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,640
is simply put the most convenient thing

1935
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,480
you could ever have i even have one

1936
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,160
on my number two so i've got my good

1937
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,520
lighting here and if you look you can

1938
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,960
see i've got my magnets here

1939
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,799
i leave my razor blade stuck to my light

1940
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,640
fixture um

1941
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,920
and so you can see i've got my good

1942
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,280
lighting and i've got it so i can swing

1943
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,720
it around and get it over whatever i'm

1944
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,760
working on

1945
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,680
uh when i'm working so that's number two

1946
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,440
is good lighting number three is a pair

1947
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,400
of calipers

1948
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,920
and the calipers are really necessary

1949
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,960
when you're designing because you just

1950
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,000
have to be able to look at stuff and

1951
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,440
think to yourself gosh how big is this

1952
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,480
thing going to be

1953
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,000
so i have a pair of digital calipers

1954
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,319
like this really any brand will do

1955
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,640
go on amazon and they're maybe 15 20

1956
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,400
bucks definitely get a digital pair

1957
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,000
the analog pair are cool you get to feel

1958
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,680
awesome but digital is just more useful

1959
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,799
because you can do stuff

1960
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,400
in multiple dimensions even if you're

1961
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,000
working all in millimeters

1962
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,280
which you should be um you may want to

1963
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,880
have the ability to look in inches

1964
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,839
because sometimes you're going to be

1965
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:31,440
buying tooling from america where things

1966
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,799
are in inches and it's nice to know

1967
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,400
oh this thing's actually one quarter of

1968
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,640
an inch instead of 6.35

1969
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,160
millimeters um a driver set

1970
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,760
is really important i've shown the one

1971
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,599
up there the vast star ones

1972
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,359
i've got that one right here i love it

1973
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:46,960
this one has a bajillion pieces and

1974
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:47,599
every

1975
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,839
possible thing you ever need to open you

1976
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,040
can open with one of those

1977
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,799
i also recommend a really nice allen key

1978
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,319
set um

1979
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:56,000
i've got them the metric one here if

1980
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,599
you're in america you want both metric

1981
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,760
and english uh tweezers are also really

1982
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,799
important i have

1983
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:06,240
um my fine tipped ones you definitely

1984
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,079
need a pair of really really really fine

1985
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,280
tip tweezers

1986
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,440
and i also have a curved set as well so

1987
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,359
if i drop a nut into something i can

1988
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,040
fish it back out again

1989
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,880
um yeah

1990
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,760
my number seven is kind of maybe

1991
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,559
unconventional

1992
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,240
you can get what's called key files but

1993
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,839
i honestly find a pair of good nail

1994
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:26,559
files

1995
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,079
these are a nice made in germany one

1996
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:30,079
they tend to be good enough you can file

1997
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,359
basically anything with these and it's

1998
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,240
nice because you can get them if you're

1999
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,520
working on small parts

2000
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,880
to use these um also pliers are a must

2001
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,799
have i like these these are my compound

2002
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:39,359
pliers

2003
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,200
these are really nice because they uh

2004
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,480
they you can see they kind of have that

2005
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,000
compounding action

2006
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,599
so i can get really really really

2007
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,280
incredible grip on stuff

2008
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,559
and that's for everything that's too big

2009
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,400
for my tweezers um

2010
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,400
but still needs to be grabbed i might

2011
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,599
sometimes i'll have a pair of needle

2012
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:54,720
nose pliers as well

2013
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,319
i don't actually in my shop here which

2014
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,640
i've wanted and have not had

2015
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,960
but i would recommend those as well ppe

2016
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,240
is really important but it doesn't make

2017
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,240
it until number nine on my list

2018
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,200
um every bit of ppe you should have uh

2019
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,799
safety goggles

2020
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,160
always have your own if you're borrowing

2021
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,839
from the shop they're gross

2022
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,359
they get the big clunky kinds you can't

2023
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,720
see through i like the kind they're kind

2024
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,240
of like fit like sunglasses

2025
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,760
they fit closer to your eyes so they

2026
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,119
protect around the edges and they keep

2027
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:20,720
stuff from flying in around the edges

2028
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,559
and they're just much more comfortable

2029
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,119
um so i highly recommend this kind

2030
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,119
um you always want hearing protection i

2031
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:28,480
like over ear because it's easy to get

2032
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,440
on and off quickly

2033
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,839
you can get the annie or ones um check

2034
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:32,640
the rating if you're going to be

2035
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,160
someplace really really loud

2036
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,520
and then work gloves i actually really

2037
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,799
like these ones these ones have a

2038
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,000
rubberized grip on them

2039
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,160
that lets me pick up stuff um and that's

2040
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,680
if i'm in the machine shop i like using

2041
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,960
those if i'm welding of course i'm going

2042
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,559
to use big thick leather gloves while

2043
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:45,119
i'm welding

2044
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,200
and a welding helmet because you don't

2045
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,040
want to go blind or even if you've got

2046
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:49,760
goggles

2047
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,880
you don't want to get the sunburn off

2048
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,160
your welding arc which is a real thing

2049
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,520
um i'm a big fan of the dremel i like a

2050
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,799
cordless one

2051
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,599
they go up to what 30 000 rpm and

2052
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,440
they'll cut through grind through

2053
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,839
deal with anything they are an awesome

2054
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:06,640
tool

2055
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,960
um and you should familiarize yourself

2056
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,680
with one

2057
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,480
that's one where uh just a rotary tool

2058
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,160
of any sort they're all really good

2059
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,680
i went with a dremel brand but you can

2060
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,960
go with whatever you want tremble is a

2061
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,720
brand name like xerox or whatever

2062
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,400
you can go with any i don't specifically

2063
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,000
endorse them

2064
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,359
you also want to have a drill or an

2065
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:25,680
impact driver this is a cordless drill i

2066
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,480
prefer that

2067
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,799
makita is my favorite brand but honestly

2068
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:30,079
i'm using i've been using a lot of bosch

2069
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,760
since i'm in germany and they're great

2070
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,200
um an impact driver and a drill are

2071
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,799
pretty similar the difference between

2072
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,119
the two is that a drill has a chuck

2073
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,000
here that uh will let you clamp any size

2074
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,599
to let you chuck any size thing it

2075
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:42,319
contracts

2076
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:43,920
whereas your impact driver just has this

2077
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,079
little hex fitting and it's a little

2078
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,480
fat much faster to pick up in and out

2079
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,160
but you can't do arbitrary size drills

2080
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,440
plus an impact driver

2081
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,760
when it stalls will push forward and

2082
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,559
then

2083
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,880
resume and that lets you unstick things

2084
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,760
and crank things in

2085
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,599
way tighter than a drill can get but

2086
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,200
it's also not great for actually

2087
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,039
drilling

2088
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:05,039
finally one that i really like uh i've

2089
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:06,400
got a picture of down here i'm not gonna

2090
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,280
pick mine up

2091
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,280
is a soldering station with a heat gun

2092
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,960
heat guns are basically the best tool

2093
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,599
ever

2094
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,359
um that's not true they're the twelfth

2095
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,119
best tool ever but a soldering station

2096
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,559
is nice if you're doing any electronics

2097
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,160
highly recommend having something

2098
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,480
that gets you both of these things um

2099
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,079
this one's similar to mine but not

2100
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,359
exactly the same

2101
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,680
um but it's nice to have that there so

2102
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,880
that's the 12.

2103
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,319
that's our whole agenda i went a few

2104
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:30,000
minutes over i'm dreadfully sorry

2105
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,039
um but uh i just want to remind you guys

2106
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:33,760
engineering is

2107
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,440
all about iteration prototyping in

2108
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,280
particular try stuff

2109
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,880
get out there into the shop get out

2110
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,039
there welding um

2111
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:42,880
like i i recommend finding your local

2112
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,960
hackerspace um

2113
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,039
and uh and uh and getting getting

2114
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:50,400
some of these tools and access from

2115
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,440
these tools a lot of these tools are

2116
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,160
really cheap you know razer blade costs

2117
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,920
eight bucks for a hundred you can use

2118
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,480
them a lot yeah

2119
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,880
so that's it now you know how to build

2120
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,160
everything including this delightful

2121
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:02,720
thing

2122
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:10,399
which is definitely possible to build
