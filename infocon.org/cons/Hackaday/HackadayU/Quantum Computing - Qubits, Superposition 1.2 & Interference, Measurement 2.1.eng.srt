[Music]

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,880
all right

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,320
coming back to it this is our

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,200
hackaday quantum computing page this is

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,640
where you can find the slides

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,760
and i post the recording link here and

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,880
the thing that i'm

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,400
also asking people to do is you can

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,080
you can make comments and send questions

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,800
here if

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,000
your questions that you post in the

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,160
message here do not get answered just

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,440
come to

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,160
hackaday page i have noted down some of

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,559
these

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,680
questions from last class

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,559
some of them i've already answered but

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,280
some of them

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,600
may come back i may address them in the

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,360
class or

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,480
make further comics to describe

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,360
the answers so thanks edward for posting

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,199
a question here

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,000
so let's come back to the slides

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,760
and i think we've already seen that zoom

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,880
is not quite as

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,880
good as collaboration let's just ask

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,280
questions in the chat

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,320
and not to interrupt

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,600
the class i want to

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,960
show give people some recap from last

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,840
time

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,920
and also for some first timers this

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,400
may be helpful last time we talked about

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,920
what qubits are

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,640
and superpositions in general

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,439
you can imagine all kinds of quantum

38
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,159
systems

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,479
with all kinds of probabilities

40
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,680
they would just add up in the linear

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,280
combination that's called superposition

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,799
so here we are seeing one qubit that has

43
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,560
is 0 or 1

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,920
being in superposition with an amplitude

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,520
a and b the amphibian

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,080
here has a significance that when you

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,959
have

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,360
a square of the amplitude it means the

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,319
probability

50
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,599
of that incidence

51
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,239
zero for example a squared means how

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:18,879
much

53
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,080
of zero the probability of

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
that state being in your system

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,319
this is a recap to just show you some of

56
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,840
the examples

57
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,959
that quantum state

58
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,160
is a representation of probabilities

59
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,280
and the significance of amplitude

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,480
here really gives us

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,319
the opportunity to understand

62
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,280
measurement so let's delve a little bit

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,080
of

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,239
the

65
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,560
amplitude here again

66
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,360
i've shown here several different

67
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,000
numbers of

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,120
qubits if we have one qubit

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,680
that means your system could be zero or

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,640
one

71
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,239
the probability of zero or one

72
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,879
is given by the amplitude a and b here

73
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,920
a and b can be any number

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
it could be positive negative or complex

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,040
numbers

76
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,080
as long as their square is their

77
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,519
magnitude squared

78
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,560
summing out equal to one from this pie

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,920
chart you can easily see

80
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,239
that the probability needs to add up to

81
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,159
one so the area together form a circle

82
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,519
if you have two qubits then there are

83
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,480
four

84
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,760
possible configurations you can put your

85
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,280
two qubits in

86
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,640
the it could be

87
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,840
both qubits could be zero or both of

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,799
them could be

89
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,319
one but we also have the case that one

90
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,120
of them could be

91
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
zero one of them could be one so in

92
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,840
total we have four

93
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,360
possible configurations to represent the

94
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,760
full

95
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,040
state you write out all four

96
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,199
possibilities with weight amplitude abcd

97
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,918
again you are summing up the squares

98
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,479
each

99
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,759
of them to get a one

100
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,479
if you have three cubits same thing but

101
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,400
then you are having

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,400
eight different possible configurations

103
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,639
so what is this telling us that as the

104
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,840
number of cubits

105
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,120
increase if we have number n

106
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
and qubits then there are two to the n

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,440
possible configurations

108
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,320
in your system this is very powerful

109
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,400
instead of classical computing classical

110
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,280
bits

111
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,880
where you have to represent every single

112
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,479
state with a bit here you have

113
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,039
a superposition of all those

114
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,199
possibilities

115
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,560
you can even just shorten your

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,320
writing to the summation of all the

117
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,360
configurations all the possibilities

118
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,039
here we see that the number

119
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,320
of configuration scales as the number of

120
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,000
qubits

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,160
with 2 to the n but also

122
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,800
the there's infinite numbers of

123
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,800
possibilities for these amplitude

124
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,160
this is one of the most powerful things

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,039
about

126
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,160
a quantum bit is that

127
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,080
is got all of these possibilities

128
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,600
all in superposition together

129
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,800
and they

130
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,919
all exist if you were to describe it

131
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,120
with a classical bit

132
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,160
you would have infinite number to

133
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,479
describe them

134
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,520
and we started using the

135
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,080
direct notation i haven't really

136
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,440
introduced it

137
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,160
but that was that a symbol there

138
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
a vertical line and your state plus

139
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,800
a bracket but i want to i want to show

140
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,120
you

141
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,520
where it first came from

142
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,720
it's named after paul direct one of the

143
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,960
greatest physicists

144
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,479
who contributed in quantum computing in

145
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,880
the 60s

146
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,600
that during that time it was when

147
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,039
quantum mechanics

148
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,800
was just starting

149
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,120
physicists back then were only familiar

150
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,880
with classical

151
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,840
systems when they observed quantum

152
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,199
behaviors in

153
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,160
experiments they found them very very

154
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,199
strange

155
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,000
and they didn't know why those results

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,280
came about

157
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,759
however they could write down they could

158
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,800
try to

159
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,160
capture them with equations

160
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,440
so this shortage equation describes

161
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,280
a quantum system

162
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,360
if you look at the form of the fraud

163
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,479
injury equation

164
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,840
you know that this is a wave equation

165
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,520
the solution to the wave equation is

166
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,800
a wave function if you look at this form

167
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,280
here that's what i showed earlier

168
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,800
a summation of all the possibilities

169
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,479
all the possible wave functions

170
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,680
together they form a solution

171
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,800
to this schrodinger equation here

172
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,400
and direct came

173
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,520
up with this notation to shorten

174
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,840
how we write it because otherwise you

175
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,440
have to represent

176
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,800
your coefficients and each way function

177
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,240
in a very lengthy wave function

178
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,840
notation and there's overlap integrals

179
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,440
involved is very

180
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,120
lengthy but he just wrote out okay so

181
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,000
this whole thing will represent a state

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,319
and the coefficient you can get it from

183
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,240
the overlapping integral

184
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,639
of that particular state with the

185
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,080
overall state

186
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,560
this is a little bit of physics and we

187
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,680
won't be

188
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,399
using it very often so i just wanted to

189
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,519
mention this for people who know about

190
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,919
the quantum mechanics schrodinger

191
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,599
equations

192
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,800
to see the significance

193
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,560
of a qubit compared to

194
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,640
a wave function here this notation is

195
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,240
called kit so this is part of a bracket

196
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
notation this whole thing is called

197
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,920
uh bracket the beginning this one is

198
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,680
called the bra this one is not kit

199
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,480
so together they mean a integral

200
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,680
so not not so much of way functions will

201
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,000
be needed but for people who

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,519
learned a classical way of learning

203
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,760
quantum mechanics this is how they

204
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
relate

205
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,519
but i want to go back to the importance

206
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,080
of

207
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,839
amplitude where what else have we

208
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,959
learned about amplitudes we've

209
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,080
experienced it every day in

210
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,800
waves water waves sound waves light

211
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,680
waves they

212
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,040
all have amplitudes and

213
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,600
electrical waves that we detect our

214
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
oscilloscopes

215
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,360
you've seen a lot of these we know that

216
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,839
amplitudes if they have the same sign if

217
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,560
they point

218
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,440
in the same direction they add up so the

219
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,720
amplitude of

220
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,560
two two different waves

221
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,640
if they are constructively interfering

222
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,720
they would be adding up

223
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,399
but if their signs are pointing in

224
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,560
opposite directions

225
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,079
they will cancel each other out

226
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,920
this happens in our quantum mechanics

227
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,120
and essentially that is what we

228
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,880
observe every day so

229
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,839
let me give you an example of how the

230
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,279
amplitude

231
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,160
can is a significant

232
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,640
quantity in quantum mechanics so

233
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,480
classically

234
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,440
if you want to represent probability you

235
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,279
just write out the probability

236
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,880
so say i want to know

237
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,760
uh if it's raining or sunny the day

238
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,279
after tomorrow

239
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,600
if we were in a classical system you

240
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,839
just draw out the tree diagram

241
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,760
and you multiply down all the

242
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,920
probabilities so suddenly you have

243
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,800
two paths to get sunny this fifty

244
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,680
percent

245
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,560
tomorrow being sunny had can split into

246
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,240
two outcomes with i'm just giving

247
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,160
random numbers here thirty percent of

248
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
being sunny and seventy percent of being

249
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,360
rainy

250
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,480
you time these two plus

251
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,279
the other option is first getting rainy

252
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,880
and then go to sunny

253
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,920
so in this case you get sixty percent of

254
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,240
likelihood that tomorrow the day after

255
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
tomorrow is sunny

256
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,480
however if you were in a quantum system

257
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,640
the probability is not what we use

258
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,440
directly we use amplitudes

259
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240
the coefficients that we put in front of

260
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,800
the states

261
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,720
so we take a square root of these

262
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,480
numbers

263
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,160
but then because amplitudes we don't

264
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,480
have any requirement of their signs

265
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,160
as i mentioned earlier it could be

266
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
positive negative or even complex

267
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,000
numbers

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,120
we for the sake of proving this

269
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,760
i'm just randomly assigning a minus sign

270
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,160
here

271
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,279
and see what hap what happens

272
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,680
what you need to do is first time down

273
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,440
the amplitudes

274
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,519
and then take a square of the whole

275
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,720
summation but then because of this

276
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,839
negative sign here this path of getting

277
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,639
a sunny day

278
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,320
is interfering with your first paths

279
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,279
it actually subtracts with that and

280
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,880
reduces

281
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,399
the probability of getting sunny day

282
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,760
so this is very strange it is

283
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,639
showing that in the quantum system

284
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,200
having more paths to get to the answer

285
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,240
you want

286
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,639
could lead to the reduction of his

287
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,320
likelihood

288
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
this is very strange it is very

289
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,600
different from

290
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,279
what we are used to in classical case

291
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,399
essentially what we observe

292
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,880
in a quantum system

293
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,000
[Music]

294
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,279
is what

295
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,040
the most possible outcome is

296
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,480
that goes from a

297
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
that comes out of a constructive

298
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,560
interference

299
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,920
so i think this may be seeing it the

300
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,360
first time

301
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,240
is not very easy to absorb but think

302
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,519
about it

303
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,760
more after this class is that

304
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,440
there could be an interpretation of

305
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,839
measurements in quantum mechanics

306
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,959
being we have all kinds of

307
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,160
possibilities existing

308
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,360
but what we see

309
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,480
is the outcome from constructive

310
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,680
interference

311
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,880
because the destructive ones get

312
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,079
cancelled out so the

313
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,880
just making an analogy the

314
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,199
very fact that we are sitting here

315
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,360
talking about quantum mechanics

316
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,199
could be a constructive outcome

317
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,680
of the other possibilities that we might

318
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,240
be somewhere else

319
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,320
a obvious direct manifestation of this

320
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,079
quantum interference

321
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,560
is the double slit experiment so for

322
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,839
some people here

323
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,040
you may be familiar with this double sip

324
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,560
experiment uh

325
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,639
test out how the beam of electron

326
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,760
can land on a

327
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,120
particular place after going through

328
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,880
some slits

329
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,320
if you just have one and you block

330
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,279
one of them this common sense the most

331
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,560
of the electrons will

332
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,680
land near this slit

333
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,800
so this is plotting the probability here

334
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,240
but if you open this

335
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,880
other slit you have two slits some

336
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,040
people may think oh i would just have

337
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,079
an additional another peak here

338
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,440
but in fact it it doesn't do that

339
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,279
what we see is a we pick in the middle

340
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,920
and then the places where we may expect

341
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,759
more electrons to exist

342
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,279
they actually don't have that many

343
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,680
electrons

344
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,719
these this spectrum is caused by

345
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,040
interference

346
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,279
and this is a very direct manifestation

347
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,880
of interference and interference

348
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,000
causing causes the result of

349
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,160
our measurements so superposition

350
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,360
is enabling this strange behavior

351
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,279
of quantum interference it also enables

352
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,839
something else but we'll see it next

353
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
time

354
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,040
and

355
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,399
when we talk about measurements we also

356
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,199
should know

357
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,600
that is not reversible

358
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,399
so a spinning coin could be like our

359
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,120
qubit

360
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,920
that has possibilities of landing on

361
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,399
head

362
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,759
or tail we don't know where it

363
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,320
lands until we make a measurement so in

364
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,560
this case measurement could be when we

365
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,320
put push it down it will land on one of

366
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,959
the sides

367
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,959
and a lot of older

368
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,519
ways of explaining measurement is

369
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,639
collapsing

370
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,120
you might have heard of this term

371
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,600
collapse or projection

372
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,839
and that is the oppenheimer

373
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,280
interpretation oh sorry that's called

374
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,240
the uh

375
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,760
copenhagen interpretation

376
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,199
but now i think a lot of people are

377
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,559
starting to adopt this many worlds

378
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,679
interpretation

379
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,039
where interference is the actual

380
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,160
mechanism that goes in here but

381
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,599
of course projection or collapsing

382
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,640
it seems easier so

383
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,280
if you start with two qubits that will

384
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,760
have

385
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,640
four possible outcomes when you do a

386
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,600
measurement say

387
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,400
you are measuring the first two bits if

388
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:40,960
the

389
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,760
result is zero you would know that your

390
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,400
state

391
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,559
will be in either this 0-0 state or 0-1

392
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,280
state

393
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,160
so you get rid of the other two because

394
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,679
it's not possible

395
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,559
from those other two states then you get

396
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,760
a probability

397
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,400
of these two coefficients magnitude

398
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,120
squared

399
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,160
adding up and after the measurement

400
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,120
your states people say collapse but

401
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,160
really it's just

402
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,840
you're getting the result of these two

403
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,640
outcomes

404
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
uh some some good material to read

405
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,840
further

406
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,559
is from scott harrison these uh

407
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,919
generalized

408
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,679
probability theory where

409
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,039
he gives pretty interesting

410
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,799
explanation why our world functions with

411
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,799
amplitude square instead of just the

412
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,320
probability

413
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,600
so classically the

414
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,720
the probability adding up equal to 1

415
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,640
is called one norm and that's what

416
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,559
we are used to with our everyday

417
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,760
experience

418
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,200
but then amplitude squared

419
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,640
equal to 1 is the actual quantum

420
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,840
mechanical mechanism that goes around in

421
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,880
quantum systems and that's

422
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,559
how our world behaves that's just

423
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,000
we can always ask why

424
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,799
that is the case but really our word

425
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,520
behaves

426
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,720
in amplitude squared equal to one way

427
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,000
if you want to read some literature

428
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,160
there are some links here in the slides

429
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
you can go into

430
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,840
to is more mathematical

431
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,320
to finish off i want to give

432
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,440
people an idea of what's coming up i

433
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:35,919
think

434
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,520
we are pretty much done i don't want to

435
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,080
give

436
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,240
too much physics because this is a

437
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,320
quantum computing class and we have a

438
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,880
lot of

439
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,919
other interesting problems that we want

440
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,480
to look

441
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,559
at so theory about physics i would

442
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,760
talk about entanglements

443
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,520
next but then we'll start looking at

444
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,679
some computational theory so

445
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,240
how do we use the qubits and how do we

446
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,720
form

447
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,640
gates to manipulate the qubits

448
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,760
then we can look at algorithms we have

449
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,240
to

450
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,559
know about the algorithms in order to

451
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,679
understand

452
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,400
more about the software why it is useful

453
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,440
why are we using quantum computing i

454
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:23,840
think

455
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,200
using that we understand why we're

456
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,120
building computing then we can look at

457
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,080
hardware

458
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,919
but i know that there's a lot of

459
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,240
interest in this audience in

460
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,640
hardware so maybe it will move the

461
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
hardware a little earlier

462
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,799
but i think we need to build up some of

463
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,360
the fundamental understanding about

464
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,320
quantum mechanics and quantum computing

465
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,440
in order to

466
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,559
see how hard work is made

467
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,679
so i would give some high level

468
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,360
description of different types of

469
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,120
hardware in

470
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,480
some near future classes

471
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,600
so the time passes very fast

472
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,480
i will stop here and i would answer some

473
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,840
of the questions here
