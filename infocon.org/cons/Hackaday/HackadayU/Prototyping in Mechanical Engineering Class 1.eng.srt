[Music]

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,840
hello everybody i hope i've got my

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,240
timing right i am here in berlin my name

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,120
is will fisher

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,920
and i am presenting today uh prototyping

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,279
in mechanical engineering

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,400
so uh just want to uh

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,760
jump right in on that i'll introduce

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,000
myself a little bit more in a moment

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,160
but i just want to kick everything off

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,000
um sometimes i feel like engineering

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,920
feels a little bit

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,960
a little bit crazy and so

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,399
sometimes it just kind of feels like

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,640
like this here we'll watch a short video

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,640
the original machine had a base plate of

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,399
prefamilated amulite

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,719
surmounted by a malleable logarithmic

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,079
casing in such a

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,320
way that the two spurving bearings were

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,280
in a direct line with a panometric fam

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,199
the latter consisted simply of six

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,280
hydrocoptic marshall veins

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,840
so fitted to the ambifation lunar wane

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,480
shaft

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,680
so if this seems kind of familiar um

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,520
then uh then you're in the right place

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
so um this is

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680
uh an introduction to mechanical

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,960
engineering um

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
and so we'll just jump right in uh to

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,400
give a bit of my background i feel like

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
that's really important here um i have a

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,400
bachelor's and master's degree from rice

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,920
university in houston texas

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,840
i did my master's research at nasa you

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,280
can see that picture of me right there

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,799
at langley research center

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,040
on the left uh the bottom left that's me

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,720
at age

41
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,920
20 something um and i've been at the uh

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,520
mechanical engineering game for a long

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,320
time after my work at rice and nasa

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
i went on to work at nanoprecision

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,520
medical

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,159
npm is a medical device startup still

47
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,880
operating

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,439
i was the first non-founding employee

49
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,159
there

50
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,280
um and they have an amazingly cool

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,720
product

52
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
an implant for type 2 diabetes treatment

53
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,159
that uses

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,200
nanoporous titanium titanium oxide

55
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,079
membrane

56
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,479
to control the release of drug into the

57
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,200
body so

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,040
i spent seven and a half years at nano

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
precision doing all sorts of cool stuff

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
so there's the nano pores

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,479
those are actually electron microscope

62
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,159
images that i took um

63
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,560
and those are uh they're about 50

64
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,680
nanometers wide at the top and about 600

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,800
to 800 nanometers long uh no i lied

66
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
they're

67
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,120
uh 60 microns anyway uh not that that's

68
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
super relevant but you can get this

69
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,879
they've got about a 601 aspect ratio

70
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,720
there um and so those are

71
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,080
those are the little nano structures

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,280
that i worked at while i was in nano

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,920
precision

74
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,319
i also worked there as our head of

75
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,200
prototyping

76
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,080
so i supported all of our all of our

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,440
staff

78
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,280
building things in the prototyping

79
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,480
department

80
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,080
that scientists and engineers on our

81
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,319
technical team needed and they got

82
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,879
weird uh radiation shielding full-scale

83
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,640
clean rooms electron microscope mounts

84
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,440
you name it

85
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,599
i built all sorts of ridiculous things

86
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,239
on that while i was at nano precision i

87
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,920
sat for the patent registration exam

88
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,760
sometimes called the patent bar

89
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,319
and uh became a registered united states

90
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,800
patent agent

91
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,080
i thought patents were going to be great

92
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
fun but it turns out i prefer my time in

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,440
the machine shop we'll get back to that

94
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,599
it's recurring theme

95
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,400
and so while it's great it wasn't quite

96
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,280
for me

97
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,239
so i kept working at nano precision

98
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,920
orchestrated several crane lifts to get

99
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
major pieces of equipment in

100
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,599
and then figured out how to repair and

101
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,120
use those pieces of equipment

102
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,720
soldering upside down is something of a

103
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,920
specialty but it's a fun one

104
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,840
after that i started my own company d20

105
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,799
robotics

106
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,799
what you see on your screen there is our

107
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,080
robot the blaster

108
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,000
the blaster uses facial detection to

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,599
fire a stream of alcohol

110
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,319
into your mouth from across the room

111
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,400
which is basically the most unnecessary

112
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,920
fun engineering project that ever

113
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,040
existed

114
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
and we had a lot of fun building that i

115
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
used that company to go get my mba at

116
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
the university of chicago

117
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,200
uh which was a fantastic time but again

118
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,120
i started missing the machine shop

119
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,159
so i moved to berlin after i graduated

120
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,799
where i'm currently located and uh i

121
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,319
started a company with an old friend of

122
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:02,720
mine

123
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,640
building smart furniture what you see on

124
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,080
your screen is

125
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,799
a smart bed that lifts itself along a

126
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,400
track system and then there's a

127
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
desk nestled in underneath and it can

128
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,879
move from sit to stand to all the way up

129
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,160
and that way you have all this extra

130
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,600
space if you live in a tiny tiny

131
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
apartment like mine

132
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,918
so uh so that's kind of my engineering

133
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,639
background

134
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,680
uh wrinkle wound down uh in august

135
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,360
and so i've been freelancing as an

136
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,880
engineer since then which means you can

137
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,840
hire me

138
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,000
um and i also spend some of my free time

139
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,759
as an improviser kind of on the

140
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,040
semi-professional level

141
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,360
making jokes at people and reacting to

142
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,800
things that people tell me to do that's

143
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,600
funny

144
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
so that's kind of where i how i got here

145
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,199
plus i'm now a certified hackaday

146
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,240
instructor as of

147
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,600
uh four minutes ago so um

148
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,520
i'm glad you guys are all here uh

149
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,800
looking forward to

150
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,759
moving through all of this sort of stuff

151
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,520
because of my background

152
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,039
i am a prototyper i am yes a mechanical

153
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,400
engineer i've worked in a

154
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,039
wide variety of industries and

155
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,840
most of that work has been done in the

156
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,639
prototyping realm

157
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,960
and so i am not the sort of mechanical

158
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,160
engineer that would work

159
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,360
for years on uh you know a turbine or

160
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,199
a jet engine which are basically the

161
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,639
same thing um

162
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,160
an internal combustion engine that sort

163
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,479
of stuff those are really cool things

164
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,400
and i know enough about those things to

165
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
be dangerous but

166
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,919
my real focus has been in prototyping

167
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,759
and so as a result the class will be

168
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,560
based around

169
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,360
kind of the questions you need to ask to

170
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,039
get your prototype off the ground and

171
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,880
they tend to be a really nice

172
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,840
set of questions just kind of generally

173
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,120
to think about as you're

174
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,800
doing mechanical engineering cool

175
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,039
let's dive in so uh today's agenda

176
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,199
you guys have kind of already heard my

177
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,320
background

178
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,199
i'll go over a bit of the course overall

179
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,120
what the five weeks will

180
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,240
uh will study will be about

181
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,479
then i'll talk a little bit about kind

182
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,520
of what

183
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
is prototyping and why we like to

184
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,880
prototype

185
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,360
that is kind of an important context but

186
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,400
but just kind of

187
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
maybe a little bit of an aside and then

188
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
the bulk of today's class will be

189
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,440
around schematics and drawings those

190
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,000
represent

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,280
kind of the fundamentals of

192
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,680
communicating mechanical design

193
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,720
and so um i think

194
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,479
that should be really really useful for

195
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,919
you guys and then

196
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,919
it'll kind of set the stage for how we

197
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,759
look at stuff as we move forward

198
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,840
so we'll look at some of those i'll show

199
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,720
you some of the drawings that i've made

200
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,520
and uh and that so we'll get to that in

201
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,960
a little while

202
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,520
cool this course uh an introduction

203
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,759
so there's a kind of an old joke among

204
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,280
uh mechanical engineers and i shared

205
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
that with my office mate who sits behind

206
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,000
me who's very german

207
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,759
he's like this is an extremely american

208
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,759
approach which is mechanical engineers

209
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,720
build the weapons and

210
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,759
civil engineers build the targets and uh

211
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,840
i feel like that's uh

212
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,960
a little crass but uh um

213
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,199
but yeah so that's uh that's kind of the

214
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,360
running joke among mechanical engineers

215
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,120
so we're we're here to to build the

216
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
build the weapons i'd like to to expand

217
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
a little bit having spent

218
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,240
my entire career building non-weapon

219
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
things uh there's a lot more to

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,759
mechanical engineering than that

221
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,319
um so if we kind of break it down i

222
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,319
consider engineering to be the use of

223
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,440
science

224
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,160
in the scientific method logic and

225
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,360
empathy to design

226
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,000
useful things and i think you can

227
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,599
absolutely use science and logic to

228
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,240
design

229
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
beautiful things and i think that's art

230
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,160
and i think this this goal of designing

231
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,840
useful things whether that's useful

232
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
to an end consumer and kind of a product

233
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,120
design standpoint which i think is

234
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,240
uh kind of the the more uh like kind of

235
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,639
art

236
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,960
focused uh mechanical design there's

237
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,000
like a really nice

238
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,960
hybrid there and a good product design

239
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,160
is

240
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,680
the best or whether your users are like

241
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,919
mine have typically been which is

242
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,039
um kind of more the

243
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,720
science and engineering types so you

244
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,080
know if you're building tools for

245
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,919
another engineer

246
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,840
then you still have to figure out kind

247
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,960
of how they

248
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,560
are going to use your tools that's a

249
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,160
very important thing so you need to

250
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,560
think

251
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,759
whenever you're designing something

252
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,599
about how it's going to be used

253
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,440
and we'll talk about that as we talk

254
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,879
about design kind of that'll be a

255
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,720
recurring focus for us

256
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,640
we'll kind of tie that in with

257
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,760
everything

258
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,719
um as we go forward and what makes it

259
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,399
mechanical as compared to

260
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,719
electrical or chemical or any of those

261
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,679
sorts of things

262
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,839
i generally think of mechanical as stuff

263
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,200
that moves

264
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,080
and that could be robots and gears um it

265
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,320
could be electromechanical things

266
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,959
like stepper motors which are kind of at

267
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,320
the base of stuff

268
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,399
that's kind of an overlap um

269
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,320
manufacturing facilities might be an

270
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,959
overlap

271
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,040
of chemical and mechanical engineers if

272
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,640
you have a plant moving things through

273
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,279
turbines and that sort of stuff

274
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,760
also stuff in space which is just cool

275
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,360
who doesn't love space

276
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,640
um also planes boats dare dribbles cars

277
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,360
all of the stuff

278
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,000
the big things that move um also really

279
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
small stuff that moves so like

280
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,080
um on the nano scale um you know like

281
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,519
i've played around in that world

282
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,839
there are actuators that can move things

283
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,760
you know nanometers at a time which is

284
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,120
super cool

285
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,399
and there was definitely a mechanical

286
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,920
engineer behind all of that sort of

287
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,959
stuff

288
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,279
you also look at manufacturing equipment

289
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,480
oddly enough

290
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,080
fluids uh which refers to both uh

291
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,800
gases and liquids um technically i guess

292
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,920
plasma and

293
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
potentially other forms of matter even

294
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
on the hotter end are also fluids

295
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,240
um but mostly gases and liquids are what

296
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,000
we're considering here

297
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
are a branch of mechanical engineering

298
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,839
they do move they move to fit this the

299
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,839
container that they're in

300
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,480
and thermodynamics which doesn't always

301
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,880
move

302
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,640
is often lumped in with mechanical

303
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,720
engineering we'll talk about that in a

304
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,680
little sec

305
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,760
and it's that's done because most of the

306
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,880
exciting parts of

307
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,440
thermodynamics happen to take place in

308
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,160
fluids

309
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,760
uh thermodynamics in solid objects

310
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
is a well-established thing and it's not

311
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,440
all that exciting for the most part

312
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,240
now of course some people will argue

313
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,120
with me about that

314
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,720
and they're probably right um

315
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,440
so the things that you would learn if

316
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,279
you went to get a mechanical engineering

317
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,120
degree

318
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,519
uh statics kinetics and kinematics

319
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,279
statics is how stuff

320
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,680
stays in place and that's a very

321
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,360
relevant thing for mechanical engineers

322
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,120
who want things to stay in place

323
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,959
uh if you are fastening something to a

324
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,560
moving rocket you want to make sure that

325
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,320
it doesn't fail

326
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,920
in static movement uh kinetics

327
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,160
is uh how stuff would like tumble

328
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,519
through the air and that sort of stuff

329
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,040
and kinematics is

330
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,200
designed movement things that rotate

331
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
about a specific point

332
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,440
or linkages things that are going to

333
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,880
move gearing that sort of stuff and

334
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
we'll talk about

335
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,760
that is going to come in a fair bit

336
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,880
in in the in the last class in class 5.

337
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,200
materials is also commonly taught in

338
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
conjunction with mechanical engineering

339
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
it is a field into unto itself

340
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,760
that is magical and i highly recommend

341
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,560
many wikipedia deep dives in there

342
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,399
because material science is really

343
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,000
really cool we'll talk about

344
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,959
that a lot next week week two is focused

345
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:31,760
on

346
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,279
basically material science as it

347
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,200
pertains to mechanical engineering

348
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,760
prototyping

349
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,320
electromechanical systems as i mentioned

350
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
in the last slide mechatronics robotics

351
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,440
that stuff

352
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,120
often falls into the realm of the

353
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
mechanical engineer

354
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,399
fluids which includes aerodynamics

355
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,279
acoustics turbine design a lot of that

356
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,079
sort of stuff

357
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,600
often taught in mechanical engineering

358
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,279
as well same with a

359
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,839
huge variety of thermodynamics um heat

360
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,399
transfer

361
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,959
psychrometrics is the study of dew

362
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,120
points and making human habitable

363
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,040
uh environments it's basically air

364
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,320
conditioning heating

365
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,120
that sort of stuff and the study of that

366
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
vibration is a huge part of mechanical

367
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,680
engineering

368
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
um and that's a very important thing

369
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,360
because you don't want your car to

370
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
vibrate apart

371
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
and there's a lot of math in vibration

372
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,600
and that's usually taught towards the

373
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,720
end of your degree

374
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,399
along with control theory which is

375
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,000
basically how do you get a robot to stop

376
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,440
where you want it to

377
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,079
it's a non-trivial problem and uh there

378
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,639
are

379
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,160
generations of engineers who have worked

380
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
on this problem

381
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,839
and uh we've got a pretty good solution

382
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,839
but there's still always more optimal

383
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,200
that you can get

384
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,519
plus mechanical engineering has a whole

385
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,040
whole lot of math much of it is in the

386
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,240
calculus world

387
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,040
oddly enough until the 1960s and 70s

388
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,240
mechanical engineering was taught

389
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,920
entirely with algebra

390
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,480
and you can do basically all of the

391
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,560
practical applications of engineering

392
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,959
mechanical engineering with just algebra

393
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,320
that's true also in a variety of

394
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,519
engineering fields

395
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,200
um using lookup tables and the like

396
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
uh in the case of mechanical engineering

397
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,839
a lot of times it's laplace transforms

398
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,440
where you

399
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,839
look up a thing in a table it translates

400
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,200
calculus into algebra you do your

401
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,959
algebra and you translate it back

402
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,480
in the case of electrical engineering

403
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,760
you do the same thing with fourier

404
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,200
transforms which look at repeated and

405
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,560
periodic signals

406
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,959
um periodic signals are very uncommon in

407
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,519
the mechanical world because of friction

408
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,519
and so the laplace really looks at the

409
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,120
decay of stuff

410
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,040
and that's as far into calculus as we'll

411
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,199
get

412
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,399
so uh no need to worry about that uh

413
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,560
any more than that just the idea that

414
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,839
you could potentially

415
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,399
do all of mechanical engineering with no

416
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,120
calculus

417
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
which is magical i think that's one of

418
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,480
the coolest things that they don't teach

419
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:46,959
you

420
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,079
in your mechanical engineering degree so

421
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,360
we probably won't do anything more

422
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,040
complicated than basic algebra maybe

423
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,120
some multiplication and stuff

424
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,320
and most of that will be in

425
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,000
weeks four and five a quick aside

426
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,959
uh i live and work in germany despite

427
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,560
being an american i speak

428
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,639
both of these languages metric and

429
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,480
english you might think i speak german

430
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,560
only poorly

431
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,880
but uh we're going to do most of our

432
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,839
work in metric

433
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,480
now there are some counter examples this

434
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,360
very class

435
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,720
we will be looking at schematic drawings

436
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,199
in english and it kills me to do that

437
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,079
but uh that's the way of the world um i

438
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:28,880
think most

439
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,959
most people coming into mechanical

440
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,399
engineering from other fields

441
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,639
think to themselves my god why would you

442
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,040
ever do stuff in the english units

443
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,160
and uh and and this is particularly true

444
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,040
in europe where

445
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,880
uh there's a lot of criticism i face

446
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,959
from my lovely european colleagues

447
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,279
about why the english system exists and

448
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,639
if you ever go to

449
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,480
a um an american manufacturing plant you

450
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,920
will see exactly why

451
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,839
and i remember when i first started in

452
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,040
um engineering

453
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,880
in the u.s i'd come right out of

454
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,480
undergrad we had learned both types of

455
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,560
units and i thought to myself my god

456
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,959
uh metric is just so much easier why

457
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,639
don't we use metric that'll make it

458
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,959
way better so we made all of our initial

459
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,480
drawings in metric

460
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,600
um and uh you know stamped them and sent

461
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,800
them off to the machine shop got the

462
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,600
parts made

463
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
got all of our parts sent back and i

464
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,199
called up the guy and i was like look

465
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,800
uh you know we inspected this part it's

466
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,880
like you know like on this dimension he

467
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,240
was like which dimension and i was like

468
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,800
this mentioned

469
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,040
he pulls out his print and he looks at

470
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,880
him he's like oh you mean the ones this

471
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,399
many foul and i was like

472
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,720
why did you put this all in inches what

473
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,839
are you doing

474
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,920
and they had gone through our drawings

475
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,440
and they had crossed out everything in

476
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,720
millimeters

477
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,360
and hand calculated them in inches and

478
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,880
gone back because all of their machines

479
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,639
ran in inches and they had to run

480
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,120
everything in inches so that was kind of

481
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,560
a learning experience for me

482
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,120
i very quickly learned to embrace the

483
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,839
thau

484
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,279
as it's called which is a thousandth of

485
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,600
an inch um

486
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,720
the uh the english units

487
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
continued to get crazier even though

488
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,839
science progressed

489
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,399
and we were able to do things and

490
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,800
measure things at incredibly

491
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,880
fine details you know most the

492
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,120
scientific world would use nanometers

493
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,040
uh of course the machining world

494
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,959
measures things like surface roughness

495
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,600
in micro inches which is a millionth of

496
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,160
an inch

497
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,720
now that is a preposterous unit for

498
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,320
anyone actually like

499
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,560
doing something but you can tell the

500
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
finish if you move your finger across a

501
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
64 micro inch surface

502
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,399
as compared to a four micro inch surface

503
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,000
you can tell the difference

504
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
um and so sometimes you specify these

505
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,680
sorts of things

506
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,199
and if you're getting work done in an

507
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,360
american machine shop i regret to inform

508
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,920
you

509
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,279
they will probably accept english units

510
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,680
much more happily than they will metric

511
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,320
um and that bums me out because the

512
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,240
world should run on metric and if you

513
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,320
let me wave a wand and choose a thing to

514
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,680
change about america

515
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,399
that'll be down the list of ways but um

516
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,720
it'd be on there

517
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,399
so i'm going to take a quick swig of

518
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,839
water i'm going pretty quick here

519
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,919
and it's all talking all the time

520
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,400
so just a quick overview of what i am

521
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,280
hoping to cover in our five classes

522
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,079
and depending on timing uh some things

523
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,280
may get cut so

524
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,319
uh a disclaimer there

525
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,280
the class class one is an overview of

526
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,799
kind of the whole thing our intro

527
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,160
we'll talk about prototyping and then

528
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,280
the bulk of the class will be on

529
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,720
schematic drawings

530
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,760
class 2 will be about materials material

531
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,360
selection

532
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,760
material properties why you would want

533
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
to choose different materials

534
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,120
class 3 is going to be the blitz

535
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,919
of the classes we're going to cover uh

536
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:48,559
not only

537
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,720
my 12 recommended tools that a good

538
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
mechanical engineer would want to have

539
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,000
most of them are really cheap you can

540
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,559
buy them at the local hardware store

541
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,480
um but we'll also take a look at

542
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,799
fabrication in the machine shop so a lot

543
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,320
of people and a lot of youtube videos

544
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,760
will cover

545
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,559
3d printing i want to actually get out

546
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,520
into the shop

547
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,679
show you what a lathe is we probably

548
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,200
won't power any of the tools up show you

549
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,000
what a mill is

550
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,679
show you how to think about your parts

551
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,840
in different axes and where you'll

552
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,640
where you'll think about design for that

553
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,360
class

554
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,240
4 is all of fluids and thermodynamics in

555
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,360
an hour

556
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,480
which is ambitious because i think i

557
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,520
took

558
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,640
six courses semester long over the

559
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,280
course of

560
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,039
those two subjects so it's gonna be fast

561
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,919
we're gonna be moving uh the which is

562
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,760
exactly the topic of class 5 which is

563
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,320
motion

564
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,480
we'll talk about gears and gearing

565
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,320
bearings actuation motors

566
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,280
and maybe linkages so there's a ton to

567
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,480
cover there

568
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,640
as a result it's going to be a very high

569
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,039
level look at these fields

570
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,919
my goal is to teach you guys a style of

571
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,480
thinking

572
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
so that you can approach your problems

573
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,679
and think about where you would want to

574
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,760
look to find the deeper

575
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
the deeper things and in fact this is

576
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,760
how i go about solving my problems

577
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,080
uh when i'm prototyping so just today i

578
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,360
spent hours

579
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,480
googling um epoxies that will bond to

580
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,280
silicone

581
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,200
for a project that i'm working on

582
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,360
because that stuff is is relevant and

583
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,440
sometimes google is your best friend it

584
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,679
makes us all much better engineers

585
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,240
so that's a very exciting thing i'll

586
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
even talk about some of my favorite

587
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,720
resources

588
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,840
as we kind of go along so

589
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
um the pace as i said is going to be

590
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,960
very very quick

591
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,720
um to learn these skills more in depth

592
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,919
you can certainly ask all of the

593
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,080
questions you want in office hours

594
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,160
or i also recommend i use youtube

595
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,000
frequently to learn stuff

596
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,720
that i need to know if you have um

597
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,640
specific skills

598
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,360
basically you can youtube how to do a

599
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
schematic drawing and someone will come

600
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,960
up with 15 minutes on how to do this

601
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,919
sort of thing or

602
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,240
or how to turn steel on a lathe all of

603
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,200
those sorts of things

604
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,280
plus i'll put my email up at the end of

605
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,799
the class and you guys can email me

606
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,919
directly

607
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,080
whenever you like i don't promise i'll

608
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,919
respond if i get a whole lot of things

609
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,400
but

610
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,120
usually i do because i'm a compulsive

611
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,240
inbox zero where

612
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,440
we all have our weird hills to die on um

613
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,600
okay cool that's the course intro we'll

614
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,520
move right along

615
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,559
into what and why is prototyping um

616
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,320
so prototyping is uh well

617
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,200
i think this quote uh from thomas edison

618
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,960
really sums uh gets us moving the right

619
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,159
direction which is one you've heard a

620
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,679
bajillion times before

621
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,480
genius is one percent inspiration 99

622
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,919
perspiration

623
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,000
and i think prototyping is kind of the

624
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,200
the second percent

625
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,840
you know the first percent is this

626
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,640
inspiration

627
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,760
and then percent number two through

628
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,360
maybe 15 is kind of prototyping

629
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,159
um and it's important because uh

630
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,039
prototyping

631
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,200
is really necessary to teach you

632
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,080
something

633
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,640
and uh you need some way to learn and i

634
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,480
think having kind of like a

635
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,919
typical prototyping method uh

636
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,559
helps you kind of think through how to

637
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,400
get things going so you start with this

638
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,440
inspiration on one hand

639
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,120
and you need to get somewhere that kind

640
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,760
of proves or disproves your idea

641
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
and so that's kind of where prototyping

642
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,799
comes in

643
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,559
in order to make it effective

644
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,320
prototyping needs to be quick

645
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,880
um and as a result of it being quick it

646
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,440
often

647
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,600
is imperfect and i think that's a real

648
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,960
imperfect may even be a goal in itself

649
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
in order to get things moving most

650
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,080
quickly

651
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,320
and so you really want to prototype

652
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,240
towards a specific question whether you

653
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,320
are prototyping a business which is

654
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,480
can i um get this startup off the ground

655
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
here we're talking about prototyping

656
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
stuff things you're gonna make

657
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,760
um so you probably want to prototype uh

658
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,039
with a question in mind such as uh

659
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,200
what if i'm building a large project

660
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,039
will make or break this project

661
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,280
um like things moving back and forth on

662
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,159
a slide rail

663
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,440
somebody has solved that problem you

664
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
don't have to prototype that um

665
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,320
but bonding stuff can i mold this part

666
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,159
out of silicone and then glue it to a

667
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:20,720
thing

668
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,919
that's a project that i'm working on

669
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,240
right now um and that's a big question

670
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,120
can i lift a bed and bed frame on

671
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
spindly legs with little actuators

672
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,679
that was a project for my last startup

673
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,559
and uh

674
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,000
you know you prototype that and that's a

675
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,600
very important thing

676
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,720
you're looking for the questions that

677
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,240
need to be answered before your whole

678
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,880
project

679
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,200
works sometimes you're just prototyping

680
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
the very smallest little widget

681
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,960
thing in there to make sure that it all

682
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,280
works

683
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
so as you prototype your goal is to kind

684
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,039
of create a prototype as quickly as

685
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,000
possible so that you can

686
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,320
still get a solid answer out of it it

687
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,919
doesn't have to be perfect you just want

688
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,520
that answer that's the goal of your

689
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,360
prototyping

690
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,080
i highly recommend very respectfully and

691
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,520
efficiently seeking the advice of

692
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,960
experts

693
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,600
long rambling monologues or obnoxious

694
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,640
but a quick question

695
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,960
in and out uh is a really nice way and

696
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,120
and oftentimes people who are expert are

697
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,240
happy to chat

698
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,400
and sometimes they even get carried away

699
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,080
i will chat at you for longer than you

700
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,799
wanted

701
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,600
um and so that's that's a thing

702
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,200
so if you're respectful about the way

703
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,640
you ask and uh

704
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
and that i think that'll that'll take

705
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,000
you the right direction

706
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,520
i think also an important part of

707
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,440
prototyping and being accepting a

708
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,320
failure

709
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,039
um the the value of prototypes is often

710
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,520
in failure you learn a lot from your

711
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,799
mistakes and i think you should

712
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,320
you should try to prototype in a way

713
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,240
that can give you definitive failure

714
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,960
or definitive success oftentimes that's

715
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,240
impossible and you end up with some

716
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,600
weird shade of gray and you say well

717
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,279
this part of it failed but like i'm

718
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,039
gonna put this thing in the other way

719
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,520
and like we'll shift things around i'm

720
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,799
finding that in a lot of my

721
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,240
my projects right now and that's just

722
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,960
kind of the nature of prototyping

723
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,400
failure is really a skill you get better

724
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,760
at failing

725
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,000
and so i recommend practicing failure

726
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,679
failing quickly is important knowing

727
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,440
when to call it saying i've learned

728
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,799
everything i can learn from this

729
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,480
let's move on and learn the next thing

730
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,320
and fail usefully so that you answer a

731
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,679
question when you fail

732
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,120
and part of that is knowing when to ask

733
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,960
the question and part of that is failing

734
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,320
in a way that you can

735
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,440
pick yourself back up and do that

736
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,720
i'll let you guys read this while i take

737
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,440
a swig of water

738
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,080
i think this is really true prototyping

739
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,600
is a practiced art

740
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,840
failure is a practice start uh all of

741
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,919
these things are muscles you work out

742
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,279
all the time part of the reason it takes

743
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,279
me forever to write code is that i don't

744
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,400
write code very much

745
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,159
i love it it takes me forever and then i

746
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,279
get frustrated because it takes me

747
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,200
forever and then i don't do it

748
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,760
this happens all the time i'm a lot

749
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,200
better at building physical stuff

750
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,159
and then when i want to go build

751
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,919
something i'm like well just print it on

752
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,760
up and the printer over there or i'll

753
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,000
take it out to the shop and fix it it's

754
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
all practice if i practice if i code it

755
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,440
as a living i'd be fast at it i'd

756
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,159
probably love it a lot more

757
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,360
um also as you prototype more i think

758
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,640
this is true of anything you get a

759
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,159
better sense for it

760
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,159
you think to yourself my gosh last time

761
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,760
i used

762
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,000
silicone and i bonded great i'm going to

763
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,200
try that same thing again

764
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
or last time i made this product out of

765
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,279
lead using sand casting

766
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,799
maybe i can make it out of aluminum this

767
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,880
time who knows

768
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,320
i just need to get a hotter forge

769
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,679
because lead's melting point is way

770
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,559
lower

771
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,480
class two materials okay

772
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,760
so that is the intro let's dive into the

773
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
really fun stuff

774
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,400
which is schematics and drawings um this

775
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,440
is one that i put

776
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,039
first in part because i knew i had an

777
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,799
intro and this is a slightly smaller

778
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,039
subject than the rest

779
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,559
but also because it's a great way to

780
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,120
start thinking about mechanical stuff

781
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,320
um so i want to start out with a bit of

782
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,520
a disclaimer

783
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
drawings and mechanical drawings are

784
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
entire careers

785
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,919
drafts people is the name of this career

786
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,039
you can go to

787
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,960
two-year university to your college and

788
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,520
get a degree in how to make drawings

789
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,960
it is a huge and difficult field

790
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,480
and we're just going to get like the

791
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,039
tiniest little beginning of it

792
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,200
in a way that is useful to you to be

793
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,360
able to read drawings

794
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,600
as a result we will not cover oh it's

795
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,039
called geometric dimensioning and

796
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:37,679
tolerance

797
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,039
tolerancing gd t which is um

798
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,360
kind of the gold standard for drawing

799
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,480
creation

800
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,919
um and you can go and take a two day

801
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,520
long seminar from professionals that

802
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,640
will teach you to do that

803
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,240
that is how intense a subject that is

804
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,159
that's why we're not covering it

805
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,919
um what i want to be able to do is give

806
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,520
you guys the skills

807
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,480
so that you can get a drawing out to a

808
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,840
machine shop

809
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,840
and they can build your part that's the

810
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
goal in half an hour we're going to try

811
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,159
and get

812
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,840
you from a place where you say i've got

813
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,679
my part in cad

814
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,600
which we're not covering cat at all in

815
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,120
this course you find that somewhere else

816
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,279
you could take your part from cad put it

817
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,720
into the drawing

818
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,000
and get a shop to make the part you want

819
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,600
ideally you're going to get the part you

820
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,960
want and it's not even going to cost you

821
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,080
a fortune because

822
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,678
money matters when you're building stuff

823
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,279
i love the schematic it's one of my very

824
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,600
favorites um

825
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,039
so drawings are important for

826
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,640
communicating stuff we're going to go

827
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,120
over

828
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,200
mechanical drawings this one is actually

829
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,480
a patent drawing

830
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,360
um from a patent i believe in like maybe

831
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,640
the 1950s

832
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,960
for a butt kicking device which i think

833
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,080
is lovely

834
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,120
um patent drawings and mechanical

835
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,760
drawings have

836
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,039
in common uh the need for for clear

837
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,720
communication of what you're doing

838
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,880
at the core of what a drawing is is that

839
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,640
it is a communication

840
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,919
medium in our case for

841
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,919
schematic drawings we want to specify

842
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,039
for manufacturing and for assembly

843
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,559
and it's also important for

844
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,399
identification it identifies you the

845
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,360
designer

846
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,399
as you are related to your part and also

847
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,320
relates the part to a company to an

848
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,919
assembly for all of these sorts of

849
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:20,640
things

850
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,080
and it's important that you be able to

851
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,399
identify a part if you have a very large

852
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,360
assembly

853
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,840
um so that's a very important thing the

854
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,720
stakes are

855
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,799
pretty high for schematic drawings this

856
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,240
is something you do want to get right

857
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,000
time and money are very important if

858
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,600
you're working as a professional

859
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,480
engineer

860
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,240
your reputation is also on the line if

861
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,760
you submit a stupid looking

862
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,120
stupid look and drawing to a machine

863
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
shop uh when you submit your next one

864
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,320
they're gonna be like oh are you the guy

865
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,679
who submitted the

866
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,760
the thing that we couldn't understand so

867
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,720
the goal is

868
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,880
uh communicate clearly and so your

869
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,640
reputation kind of rides on that

870
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,000
they don't machinists don't want their

871
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,799
time wasted any more than you do

872
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,320
um i put death in there with a question

873
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,919
mark because i initially had it in there

874
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,120
with it struck through

875
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,600
and i showed this to my my german

876
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,679
engineer office mate and he was like

877
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,880
yeah but if you design something that

878
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,120
people's lives rely on and your

879
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,320
drawings are stupid then you can

880
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,600
kill somebody by having your drawings

881
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,120
wrong and i was like oh my gosh you're

882
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,840
right

883
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,520
um so you want to be careful when you're

884
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,200
doing these

885
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,279
when you're doing these drawings uh

886
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,559
particularly if there is

887
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,120
a life a life-changing thing that you're

888
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,559
designing whether it's life-saving or

889
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,600
life ending make your drawings

890
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,918
good

891
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
here is a schematic that the same german

892
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,399
engineer gave me this is from

893
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,520
his uh his master's research uh

894
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,480
this is an excellent drawing however it

895
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,720
is

896
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,120
baffling uh this is a transmission that

897
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,039
he created as part of his thesis

898
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,000
and this is as complicated as a drawing

899
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,240
as i think i've ever seen

900
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,919
certainly i've never built anything this

901
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,520
complicated um

902
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,200
and neither did he they just made the

903
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,960
drawings for the research side of it

904
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,399
but this shows a whole bunch of gears

905
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,320
and stuff all interacting and

906
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,360
it is in a way i i consider beautiful

907
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,679
mechanical schematics to be meki porn uh

908
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,960
mechanical engineers porn

909
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,640
and this is one of those drawings i just

910
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,159
i just love it i can stare at this thing

911
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,440
all day i should get this thing in a

912
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,520
poster form put it up on the wall

913
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,559
i love it so

914
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,559
we this is an assembly drawing we will

915
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,000
be focused on

916
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,159
single part drawings for the most part

917
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,679
today

918
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,520
um so let's talk about how you read a

919
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,720
drawing

920
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,320
when you look at a drawing this is a

921
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,200
much much simpler thing i am a huge

922
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,760
uh fan of mcmaster carr you can see down

923
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,200
there on the title block that's where i

924
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,159
got this drawing

925
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,320
this is a simple bevel gear uh it's a

926
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,080
two inch diameter again we're back to

927
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,360
the english units i told you it was

928
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,480
coming i'm so sorry

929
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,399
to those of you who are not in america

930
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,840
inches are still stupid

931
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,399
um this shows you kind of the

932
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,159
fundamental components of that i think

933
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,399
you guys can see my mouse i hope so

934
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,679
um so you can see up here there is

935
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,679
a representation this is a view of your

936
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,559
part

937
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,000
um the top view a side view an isometric

938
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,960
view

939
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,159
you have dimensions on here you also

940
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,600
have notes

941
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,440
like number of teeth and the tooth pitch

942
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,880
and then you have a title block down

943
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,880
here in the bottom right

944
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,120
every drawing should have all three of

945
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,799
those things

946
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,840
so as we move forward

947
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,480
as we look at the views they typically

948
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:32,960
come

949
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
in what are called orthographic

950
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,480
projections

951
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,360
there are typically three really since

952
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,720
the goal of a drawing is to be

953
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,399
communicating stuff

954
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,960
you want to put the views in that are

955
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,600
necessary to communicate your drawing so

956
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,200
so you might not need all of them in

957
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,360
this case we have a motor from mcmaster

958
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,000
car

959
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,640
um showing you kind of about this size

960
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,519
um

961
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,960
and it's showing you the three views

962
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,480
that are necessary for this particular

963
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,039
part

964
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,640
so we've got mounting holes and the

965
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,240
layout of those mounting holes

966
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
on the bottom view so here they've taken

967
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,840
a motor and it's like they've just

968
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,480
rotated it 90 degrees and then again 90

969
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,120
degrees

970
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,039
so that's the standard way you do it is

971
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,960
you have a front a top

972
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,480
and a side view in this case they've

973
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,919
replaced the top view with the bottom

974
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,519
view

975
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,200
and uh and so you can see where and how

976
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,559
these things all match up

977
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,000
and that's relevant and the reason that

978
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,840
these drawing views are chosen as they

979
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,039
are so that you know

980
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,399
where the shaft is going to come out the

981
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,159
motor relative to the mounting holes

982
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,519
which is basically the most important

983
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,600
part of mounting a motor because if this

984
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,799
thing is going to say

985
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,880
move a transmission you want the shaft

986
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,840
to line up and be very concentric with

987
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,960
uh the the transmission in uh

988
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,240
inlet the the um shaft for the for that

989
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,440
and you can get some

990
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,039
bearings that'll self-align and that

991
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,559
sort of stuff but for the most part this

992
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,679
would be pretty spot on

993
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,720
and so it's important that their

994
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,200
dimensions are accurate uh for your

995
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,159
designs

996
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,159
now mcmaster is a wonderful resource

997
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,679
whether you're doing stuff in inches

998
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,600
or in in metric um they often offer

999
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,039
cad files for technical parts so if you

1000
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,640
need an m3 by eight millimeter

1001
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,760
countersunk screw mcmaster has the cad

1002
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,960
files for

1003
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
all of that stuff and they let you

1004
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,159
download them for free

1005
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,120
it's magic um so unlike thingiverse

1006
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,000
which is mostly

1007
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,799
people making models of stuff and it can

1008
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:25,840
be really useful

1009
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,320
for um for things like stepper motors

1010
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
mcmaster has all of your little

1011
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,640
components

1012
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,640
um to put into your cad file screws nuts

1013
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,080
washers motors even so if you're

1014
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,000
building a big assembly

1015
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,840
um it can be um

1016
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
it can be helpful to to have those

1017
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,960
things there

1018
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,480
um uh drawings also typically have

1019
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,720
can have detail in section views so i'll

1020
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,080
talk about those right now

1021
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,320
a detail view is where you have um so

1022
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,840
you can see here

1023
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,279
uh i have my my part this is actually a

1024
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,880
2.2 meter long

1025
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,039
threaded rod um and uh

1026
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,639
so i actually had this part made and

1027
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,280
it's a quarter inch in diameter which is

1028
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,719
crazy you're like will why are you

1029
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,960
mixing inches and meters

1030
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,599
uh you are absolutely right to hate me

1031
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,000
right now so too did this shop um

1032
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,760
because i had this made in an american

1033
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,119
shop because it's an american thread

1034
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,639
standard but i needed it two and a half

1035
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,119
2.2 meters long so they had to convert

1036
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,320
that to inches

1037
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,000
it was a nightmare but they they sent it

1038
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,599
to me it was magnificent i would

1039
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,199
recommend that manufacturer again

1040
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,359
for sure but you can look at the

1041
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,480
schematic here

1042
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,879
and see that i've got this the underline

1043
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,560
on that 220

1044
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,320
200 millimeters means that it is not to

1045
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,239
scale in this drawing

1046
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,159
so i've got this top part i've taken a

1047
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,760
detail view here

1048
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,839
so you can see that i've got uh the a

1049
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,440
with a circle around it that indicates

1050
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,000
the circle

1051
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,320
and then the letter indicate the detail

1052
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,839
and then i've got my a over here and

1053
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,119
this is showing

1054
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,440
this is an eight to one scale so this is

1055
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,160
eight times

1056
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,880
larger than my one-to-one scale over

1057
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,320
here

1058
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,280
that lets me show a thread call out for

1059
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,800
the thread that i'm using here i'm using

1060
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,680
an m4

1061
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,880
thread which is a standard metric thread

1062
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,720
and then i've got a thread relief here

1063
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,160
and that sort of stuff

1064
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,680
this was necessary for the components

1065
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,440
that i was using um

1066
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,240
and it was useful uh for them to know

1067
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,520
these things

1068
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,160
uh then i've also done a section so what

1069
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,599
you can see here is where i've got

1070
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,839
b as i've got these leaders pointed to

1071
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,599
the right it shows basically what would

1072
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,440
happen if i just took like a very very

1073
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,240
sharp knife

1074
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,160
and cut right down the center of my part

1075
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,280
on that axis

1076
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,960
and then i'm going to fold open and look

1077
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,800
at just half of that

1078
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,839
so that's what section b is here and

1079
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,320
it is typically noted b dash b because

1080
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,760
it's going between the point b

1081
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,240
here and the other point b here so that

1082
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,760
shows you how to

1083
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,040
show a section view and i'm showing that

1084
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,200
at scale one to one

1085
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,200
um and uh and then i'm opening up that

1086
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,040
up and showing an additional detail

1087
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,240
c here so i've got my c circle called

1088
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,000
out at a ten to one so this is actually

1089
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
even more

1090
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,599
zoomed in than my eight to one over here

1091
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,440
and that lets me specify the thread that

1092
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,960
i'm using for this part

1093
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,599
so i've done all of these units in

1094
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,720
millimeters

1095
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,440
and i've specified also as a note here

1096
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,240
that these

1097
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,800
are trapezoidal thread that's tr that's

1098
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,040
trapezoidal thread

1099
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,920
a thread fit that's 7e so when you

1100
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,359
specify a thread there's thread fits you

1101
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,880
can look all this sort of stuff up

1102
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,320
and that's all specified in the

1103
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,280
trapezoidal thread iso standard

1104
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,560
2901 convenient you'll hopefully never

1105
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,400
have to use that but if you ever do

1106
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,880
uh iso has you covered for basically

1107
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,599
every

1108
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,160
every mechanical thing that's built iso

1109
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,079
has covered iso is an international

1110
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,320
standards organization um

1111
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,000
maybe it's the international standards

1112
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
organization

1113
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,560
that would be logical um but they have

1114
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,839
standards for all sorts of stuff i'll

1115
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,280
show you a bunch of iso standards

1116
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,800
throughout that's kind of bread and

1117
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,280
butter

1118
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,680
for mechanical engineers you find

1119
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,280
yourself coming back to those

1120
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,560
there's also ansi which is american

1121
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,560
national standards institute

1122
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,800
and asme which is the

1123
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,240
american society for mechanical

1124
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,160
engineers they all produce standards for

1125
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,119
different things so

1126
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,440
if you need standards in english units

1127
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,560
those are typically done for the

1128
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,599
american organizations asme and ansi

1129
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,839
if you need metric standards those are

1130
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,839
often done by iso

1131
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,280
um cool we're going to come back to this

1132
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,000
mechanical drawing a bunch of times

1133
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,680
so you'll notice the next thing that's

1134
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,680
important is tolerances and we'll talk

1135
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,839
about tolerances in much greater detail

1136
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,839
in week 3. when you're building

1137
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,359
something

1138
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,520
tolerances really matter because if you

1139
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,720
say something like

1140
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,000
uh five plus or minus two

1141
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,079
then you have a huge range but if it's

1142
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,839
pl five plus or minus

1143
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,880
point zero zero zero one your machinist

1144
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,880
is going to make parts until they hit

1145
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,079
that spec

1146
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,280
and what that means is you are paying

1147
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,119
for every part they reject because it

1148
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,480
didn't meet spec

1149
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,760
so if you overspecify your part uh

1150
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,079
you are going to be paying a lot for it

1151
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,200
and sometimes that stuff

1152
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,800
really really matters and you want to

1153
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,359
specify very very tight tolerances

1154
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,480
um but for the most part you would like

1155
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,560
to specify the loosest tolerances you

1156
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,680
can get away with

1157
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,640
um and so for that again iso has your

1158
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
back covered

1159
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,440
2768 is a magnificent iso standard

1160
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,520
um it specifies um what precisions are

1161
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,320
needed for

1162
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,200
mostly for machine parts um and so it

1163
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,160
goes over here

1164
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,560
so what you can see is in that previous

1165
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,079
uh

1166
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,359
drawing i have down here my tolerance

1167
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,119
um and i've zoomed in on that to show

1168
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,400
you that i've called out

1169
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,920
iso 2768 mk

1170
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,800
um in my title block down here um and

1171
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,119
that

1172
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,359
mk shows that i'm looking for a medium

1173
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,400
designation

1174
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,760
here so that says for any dimension

1175
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,560
what the dimension is what the tolerance

1176
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,160
should be for that dimension

1177
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,920
and machinists will know this if you

1178
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,079
specify iso 2768

1179
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,400
every major machine shop on the planet

1180
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,440
has heard that

1181
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,599
and knows to look for what they have to

1182
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,359
hit

1183
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,920
uh the k is an additional call out and

1184
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,560
the case specifies the

1185
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,040
perpendicularity parallel flatness

1186
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,359
concentricity those sorts of things so

1187
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,160
in my case

1188
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,680
because this is a really really long

1189
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,920
skinny rod i wanted to make sure that

1190
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,680
the top and bottom were concentric

1191
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,680
so that there's not any bend or bow in

1192
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,599
this thing

1193
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,320
so this was the threaded rod used for

1194
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,359
the track system inside of the legs

1195
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,760
for my bed that was lifting so i'm

1196
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,000
hanging a lot of weight off of them

1197
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,440
and it's all in tension so i don't need

1198
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,839
that thick of a rod um but it can get

1199
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,760
kind of floppy and bendy uh the guy

1200
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,599
who's manufacturing them said as they

1201
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,880
were coming off the line these look like

1202
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,560
spaghetti and they kind of do they kind

1203
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,760
of like flop around

1204
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,200
but because i was hanging them that was

1205
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,280
fine but i wanted to make sure that all

1206
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,359
of the threading lined up with my rods

1207
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,440
so i specified that k afterwards

1208
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,680
the title blocks are their own thing

1209
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,160
that's the third major component of your

1210
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,400
of your drawings uh so you have your

1211
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,680
drawings like the

1212
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,880
the view then you have your tolerances

1213
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,160
and then your title block is where you

1214
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,800
specify

1215
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,280
all of this other stuff again iso has

1216
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,160
your back

1217
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,760
7200 uh is the standard 2004 is the

1218
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,400
release

1219
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,319
date so iso standards typically will

1220
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,000
give you a number identifier and then a

1221
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,800
release

1222
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,160
year so 2004 is the most recent one

1223
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,920
and that is nice because it's upgraded

1224
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,319
to include title blocks created by cad

1225
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,480
um instead of by hand whereas the

1226
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,640
previous one which i think is 1980

1227
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,000
most of the title blocks coming out in

1228
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,920
1980 were not done on computers they

1229
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,240
were done by hand

1230
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,880
um so your title block usually will

1231
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,440
include

1232
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,400
the part title the part number uh the

1233
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,240
tolerance call out like i showed you

1234
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,760
just a second ago

1235
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,119
the units this is particularly relevant

1236
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,400
if you want to send

1237
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,079
metric units to an american shop or

1238
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,440
inch units to anywhere else um

1239
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,839
i would i would definitely specify that

1240
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:24,720
um because

1241
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,359
you could end up with the uh the classic

1242
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,480
um

1243
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,640
miscommunication like in was it this is

1244
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,800
spinal tap where they end up with a

1245
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,640
tiny stone hinge because they use the

1246
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,720
wrong units instead of a massive and

1247
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,920
impressive stonehenge

1248
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,599
this happens or in worst case

1249
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,839
the mars climate orbiter which scrapped

1250
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,200
a zillion dollar

1251
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,880
mission into the surface of mars because

1252
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,960
the international team was using meters

1253
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,920
and the

1254
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,359
uh american team was using feet oops

1255
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,480
uh also absolutely necessary to specify

1256
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,119
material

1257
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,160
that typically lives in the uh in the

1258
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,880
title block

1259
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,000
so you can see here i've specified c15

1260
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,079
steel that's a type of steel

1261
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,560
or equivalent so sometimes a machine

1262
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,800
shop will have a better quality material

1263
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,599
on hand

1264
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,200
and rather than ordering new or they

1265
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,640
have scrap of a material that you'd

1266
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,839
rather have anyway

1267
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,760
so i like to specify ore equivalent

1268
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,040
because that lets

1269
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,319
the machine shop choose that's true in

1270
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,319
most cases some cases you need a

1271
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,520
specific material

1272
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,000
so we were doing titanium nanostructures

1273
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,960
and we were getting the parts

1274
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,079
pre-machined

1275
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,599
and there we needed a high purity

1276
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,359
titanium so you couldn't just say

1277
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,280
commercially pure titanium

1278
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,440
or equivalent because they would alloy

1279
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,119
it with cheaper things to make it more

1280
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,560
machinable because it's cheaper

1281
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,640
for the machine shop so then you specify

1282
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,040
you know cp grade 4

1283
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,880
titanium and that's what you get and

1284
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,319
then you say you know we need material

1285
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,680
specs and all that sort of stuff but for

1286
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,560
the most part

1287
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,640
i would take my material spec and toss

1288
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,160
an ore equivalent in there we're doing

1289
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,040
on time

1290
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,800
we got to be moving um

1291
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,040
oftentimes you also specify paper size

1292
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,880
and scale in the modern era mostly

1293
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,640
you're sending drawings around by

1294
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,760
pdf so paper size is kind of weird but a

1295
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,240
machine shop will often print out uh

1296
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,480
prints and then they will compare the

1297
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,400
part to the print so they will

1298
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,079
print out your drawing when they make

1299
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,520
the part they will set your part

1300
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,119
the part on top of the drawing and

1301
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,960
compare it on all the things

1302
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,040
to make sure that they didn't mess it up

1303
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,640
kind of in the course

1304
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,560
uh dimensions right so like they didn't

1305
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,319
get the l direction backwards or

1306
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,520
something

1307
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,720
um you always put your name on it

1308
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,640
as a designer uh you should be proud of

1309
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,920
the thing you're doing

1310
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,839
um but also it's important that they

1311
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,359
know who to ask questions of

1312
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,040
um sometimes you'll see multiple names

1313
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,880
in a drawing like drawn

1314
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,240
designed by drawn by approved by

1315
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,680
and that's really important if you work

1316
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,359
for a company having someone approve

1317
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,800
your drawings just means that somebody

1318
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,440
has

1319
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,800
someone else has gone through and made

1320
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,400
sure that everything makes sense they've

1321
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,440
run the numbers

1322
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,839
um particularly in industries like

1323
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,440
aerospace

1324
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,560
or big manufacturing industries

1325
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,160
there are a lot of checks on this sort

1326
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,440
of thing to make sure that you aren't

1327
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,319
producing parts that could hurt people

1328
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,599
if you're just a hobbyist you're

1329
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,359
probably not approving any drawings

1330
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,400
you don't need it um

1331
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,599
oftentimes if you're working for a

1332
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,040
company or an organization you put that

1333
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,640
in the title block you can see here i've

1334
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,160
downloaded the uh

1335
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,400
thing from wiki wikipedia and wikimedia

1336
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,480
commons has put their organization title

1337
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,839
in here

1338
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,599
there's also often approval information

1339
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,359
and the appropriate dates approved on

1340
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,800
that sort of stuff that's important for

1341
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,119
the reasons i just said

1342
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,040
uh include is necessary if you have

1343
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
multiple sheets sheet numbers

1344
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,920
notes uh that can be hey anodize this

1345
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,200
thing after you make it

1346
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,359
um all your signatures confidentiality

1347
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,400
agreements on these

1348
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,079
if you have an nda in place with someone

1349
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,319
you have patent patent or patent pending

1350
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,000
stuff you want to keep trade secret

1351
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,920
put your confidentiality notice on every

1352
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,119
single sheet

1353
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,000
always do that the patent agent in me

1354
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,400
says

1355
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,040
put your confidentiality notice on your

1356
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,319
in your title block

1357
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,640
and have an nda in place have them sign

1358
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,160
it and then they know that it's

1359
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,760
confidential and privileged information

1360
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,440
and if they share it then all the legal

1361
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,800
stuff happens to them that's bad

1362
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,560
that's a lecture that's not included in

1363
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,319
mechanical engineering

1364
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,400
okay cool let's take a look at a drawing

1365
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,359
i'm going to pull up

1366
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,560
fusion here so this is a drawing for a

1367
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,280
part i'll

1368
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,960
show you the part that i've got here

1369
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,319
this is one that i just threw together

1370
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,680
for the purposes of the drawing i've got

1371
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,760
that little square piece over there

1372
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,079
i've got uh i've got my rotational

1373
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:30,800
things here

1374
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,400
i've got a nice little hole in the

1375
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,920
bottom this is not a part used for

1376
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,440
anything it's just one made so that we

1377
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,040
could draw a thing

1378
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,800
so we'll head over here to our drawing

1379
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,119
this is a drawing i made for it

1380
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,160
and i want to show you a couple of

1381
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,359
things here that i've kind of already

1382
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:44,240
referenced

1383
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,160
first of all i've got my primary view

1384
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,760
here in the upper left that's fairly

1385
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,240
common

1386
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,440
when you're drawing stuff most

1387
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,079
machinists will will tend to look

1388
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,560
in the uh in the top left part of your

1389
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,680
drawing

1390
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,000
um for uh the the main thing

1391
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,119
because i'm using cad i like to have an

1392
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,119
isometric view down here in the bottom

1393
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:05,599
right

1394
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,280
i usually just put that wherever i can

1395
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,640
wherever it's convenient i have space

1396
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,520
left over

1397
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,520
the reason i do that uh is just so the

1398
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,880
machinist can say oh this is what it's

1399
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,160
supposed to look like i get it

1400
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
because this part as it's drawn without

1401
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,560
that can be a little bit difficult to

1402
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,920
determine

1403
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,839
i've also specified in here a center

1404
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,520
line for

1405
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,440
parts that are circular it is common to

1406
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,920
put a center line in or not mandatory

1407
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,680
and that indicates to the machinist that

1408
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,200
you want all of these dimensions to be

1409
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,160
concentric

1410
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,599
and if you're producing something like a

1411
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,200
pin that has to fit in a thing that has

1412
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:35,760
to

1413
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,839
fit into another thing which we'll i'll

1414
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,599
show you in a sec why that might be

1415
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:40,319
relevant

1416
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,319
then having that center line says the

1417
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,440
machinist uh

1418
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,079
concentricity matters um concentricity

1419
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,680
is the measure of how concentric two

1420
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,119
circles are with each other

1421
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,280
just to specify that and that can be

1422
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,880
relevant if you have bearings if you

1423
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,760
have a shaft

1424
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,040
anything that's gonna be rotating

1425
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,280
particularly at high speeds

1426
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,520
uh this is super important um

1427
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,720
and so um yeah

1428
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,160
so uh then you've got uh this top view

1429
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,680
so what i've done there is i'm now just

1430
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,200
looking at the top of it

1431
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,720
i'm tilting it over and taking a look at

1432
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,560
it in the top and that shows that this

1433
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,160
is a square because if i look at just

1434
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,200
this side view

1435
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,880
i cannot determine that's a square that

1436
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,880
could also be a circle or a hex

1437
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,040
it could be any number of shapes

1438
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,720
arbitrarily defined

1439
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,480
but i want my machinist to know that

1440
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,359
this thing is square on top

1441
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,839
now if i just show that that's square

1442
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,720
that's one thing

1443
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,000
but you'll notice that i have two

1444
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,720
identical callouts here now if i'm doing

1445
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,440
this in cad

1446
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,800
i set those equal to each other

1447
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,880
but here on my drawing i want to specify

1448
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,160
those independently

1449
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,720
so that the machinist knows just how big

1450
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,680
that square is

1451
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,880
so um

1452
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,720
i'm also going to show a section view

1453
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,160
here so i can zoom in a little bit

1454
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,520
so what i've done you can see that i've

1455
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,680
got that same eight a callout and i'm

1456
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,559
showing that

1457
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,319
my scale here is two to one

1458
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:07,680
and that's where i'm really putting most

1459
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,680
of my dimensions on so the square i need

1460
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,960
to dimension from the top here because

1461
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,160
it's the only place that it's really

1462
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,200
visible

1463
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,160
here i'm showing almost all of my

1464
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,920
dimensions

1465
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,200
except the things that i know that i'm

1466
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,119
going to call out later in my detail b

1467
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,240
here so i have my 11 in parentheses

1468
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
because that is actually specified over

1469
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:26,800
here

1470
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,520
7 plus 4 is 11. so where i have a

1471
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,880
dimension that's specified somewhere

1472
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,480
else i put it in parentheses

1473
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,000
and that tells the machinist like hey

1474
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,760
this is a dimension that like

1475
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,839
you can use but i'm going to inspect my

1476
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,839
part to a different dimension

1477
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,160
this is just an implicit dimension

1478
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,079
rather than explicit

1479
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,079
um i'm also taking a look at some other

1480
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,400
things here i have my diameter call out

1481
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,280
here

1482
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,480
at five millimeters i have this piece

1483
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,240
here so you can see those leaders go to

1484
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:54,800
this like

1485
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,119
inner inner part right here that that

1486
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,480
bevel cut that i've got

1487
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,839
the inner diameter there is 20 20

1488
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,319
millimeters um

1489
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,920
my whole depth here is 15 and just so

1490
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,119
that you guys can see it

1491
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,040
i have what's called a symmetric

1492
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,440
tolerance here and this is i want that

1493
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,520
hole to be a very specific depth let's

1494
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,880
say i have a pin that has to fit

1495
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,760
perfectly in there

1496
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,079
i want that whole depth to be more

1497
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,040
precise

1498
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,960
than my my standard drawing template has

1499
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,839
so this is over defining that and i can

1500
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,839
do that on key dimensions that i really

1501
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,359
need my machine shop

1502
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,800
to hit precisely um so i've done that

1503
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,599
here

1504
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,040
um the other dimensions are all just in

1505
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,640
millimeters i have one other thing to

1506
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:40,960
show

1507
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,559
on that part which is here i've done

1508
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,079
what's called

1509
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,680
a bilateral tolerance so let's say i

1510
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,280
want this thing to be 40 which is what i

1511
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,160
have in my cad

1512
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,839
but i don't mind if it's bigger but i

1513
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,200
mind if it's smaller maybe it has to

1514
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,640
seal on the inside of something

1515
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,480
and i really need this to be a thing so

1516
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,400
i can specify that it's not to be any

1517
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,960
bigger than 40.22 and not any smaller

1518
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,960
than 39.995

1519
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,720
so i have a very very tight tolerance on

1520
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,040
the bottom and a relatively generous

1521
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,280
one on the top and you can specify that

1522
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,160
because that's

1523
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,839
that's what i want so then i'm going

1524
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,000
over here going over here and looking on

1525
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,720
the detail

1526
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,000
just to kind of finish this out showing

1527
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,440
my height

1528
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,559
and the reason that i'm showing my

1529
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,319
height like this is because i'm going to

1530
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:20,880
inspect

1531
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,520
these dimensions later a mechanical

1532
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,160
schematic

1533
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,240
is a schematic drawing is a contract

1534
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,760
that you have with a machine shop

1535
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,720
and so every dimension that you specify

1536
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,640
you should be able to inspect

1537
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,640
somehow and we'll talk about that a

1538
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,319
little bit later in inspection

1539
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,079
but because you because this is a

1540
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,839
contract if you get a part back you

1541
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:40,880
don't want

1542
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,960
you should be able to inspect and say to

1543
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,920
your

1544
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,960
um to your shop hey um

1545
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,079
this part didn't meet the drawing i'm

1546
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,640
rejecting it and not paying for it

1547
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,680
because it's out of spec and

1548
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,280
they should a good shop will say gosh

1549
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,280
we'll take those parts back either they

1550
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,280
toss them or they re-machine them to

1551
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,640
make to fit spec

1552
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,240
um you know if you're machining out of a

1553
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,760
very expensive material they might

1554
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,800
re-machine

1555
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,680
um to make it hit spec you know you can

1556
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,119
get gold machined

1557
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,640
though why

1558
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,000
um so yeah so this is our demo one

1559
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
we'll head back over to the slideshow

1560
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,160
um normally this is where i would ask in

1561
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,920
a class any questions but since i can't

1562
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,559
hear you

1563
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,520
no questions for you till office hours

1564
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,559
take them down

1565
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,599
take notes um so we'll think a little

1566
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,960
bit more about how each of these parts

1567
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,599
are made

1568
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,480
in class three but when you create a

1569
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,280
drawing

1570
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,400
you're really going to want to create a

1571
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,119
drawing from um

1572
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,160
from the

1573
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,240
uh from the point of view of how will

1574
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,760
this be created

1575
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,240
um also because it is communication you

1576
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,119
want to be

1577
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,040
uh clear um on the visuals

1578
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,640
uh you wanna make sure that you don't

1579
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,160
have a bunch of tolerances interfering

1580
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,440
with each other and that sort of stuff

1581
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,640
oh i see

1582
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,160
uh chat is blowing up sorry

1583
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,319
um okay i will address questions at the

1584
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:12,960
end

1585
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,319
um so uh you wanna make sure you don't

1586
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:17,680
overlap

1587
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,370
tolerances

1588
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,119
[Music]

1589
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,880
so that they're difficult to see

1590
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,839
remember that you're going to be

1591
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,440
inspecting with these parts

1592
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,200
um so we'll talk about inspection in a

1593
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,400
little while but you're going to want to

1594
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,200
be

1595
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,040
inspecting to your drawings and that's

1596
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,240
important

1597
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,480
and so think about dimensioning the

1598
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,680
things that you're actually going to

1599
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,720
inspect

1600
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,800
um and don't over specify if you specify

1601
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,480
very very tight tolerances the machine

1602
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,160
shop will charge you

1603
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,720
extra to do that and so uh like i said

1604
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,559
before if you specify plus or minus

1605
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,480
point zero zero zero zero zero

1606
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,520
five the machine shop is going to

1607
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,400
uh machine shop is going to reject parts

1608
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,680
until they get ones that fit

1609
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,800
and so they're charging you for all the

1610
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,800
stuff that they reject too because

1611
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,040
their time is worth it uh don't over

1612
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,559
communicate this is important like let's

1613
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:05,440
say you have

1614
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,440
valuable intellectual property you are

1615
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,680
going to assemble three things yourself

1616
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,200
but you want different shops to handle

1617
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,800
them all so nobody figures your stuff

1618
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,960
out you can send different drawings to

1619
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,000
different people

1620
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,920
and no assembly drawing to one

1621
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,680
individual that way you keep all of your

1622
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,240
parts

1623
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,000
trade secret and no one shop has the

1624
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,680
the knowledge to recreate your whole

1625
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,040
invention um

1626
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,200
and this is this can be done um

1627
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,240
sometimes you

1628
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,240
you are more comfortable uh with one

1629
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,079
machine shop or another for ip reasons

1630
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,480
or

1631
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,079
for whatever reasons or with mass

1632
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,000
manufacturers um

1633
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,040
um so that's uh that's an important

1634
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,040
and important thing um we'll talk about

1635
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,559
tolerance stack ups in the next slide

1636
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,960
that's something that you want to avoid

1637
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,240
um if possible

1638
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,079
and i'll talk with that i also think

1639
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,760
it's oftentimes good when you're making

1640
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,400
your

1641
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,079
um your drawing to check in with your

1642
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,760
machinist or your manufacturer because

1643
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,960
they're the ones making this stuff

1644
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,359
they will have very good advice on how

1645
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:02,559
to make your drawings

1646
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,000
cool let's talk about tolerance stack

1647
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,520
ups which is the last thing in drawings

1648
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,319
then we're going to talk about

1649
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,680
inspection and i got to cram all that

1650
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,160
into

1651
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,200
six minutes so off we go um

1652
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,079
tolerance stack ups are what happens uh

1653
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:14,480
here

1654
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,720
so i will show you here's the part i

1655
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,000
have two parts that have to fit together

1656
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,800
i have a pin

1657
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,440
and a little flange um again i drew

1658
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,520
these i made these just for this class

1659
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,720
so you can kind of see what they look

1660
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,400
like they fit together and i've just got

1661
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,680
a through hole there

1662
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,000
so when we look at this and our assembly

1663
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,720
view

1664
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,319
i'm showing these sorts of things here's

1665
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,599
what an assembly would look like you can

1666
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,359
see i've got my section view this is how

1667
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:36,480
they fit together

1668
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,760
just to get you a little familiar i

1669
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,880
thought i was going to be moving faster

1670
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,079
now more time to talk about assembly

1671
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:40,880
views but nope

1672
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,680
on we go um okay so i've got my pin i'm

1673
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,319
going to

1674
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:48,000
skip to my pen here now my pen has a 28

1675
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,880
millimeter

1676
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,760
uh length to it now this is according to

1677
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,760
iso

1678
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,079
2768 mk which um

1679
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,559
we can look at over here

1680
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,920
nope not that one nope not that one uh i

1681
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,799
don't have it

1682
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:08,880
well oops um cut ahead in my slides

1683
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,640
uh but anyway that should be a plus or

1684
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,880
minus uh 0.5 i think at 28 millimeters

1685
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,440
and then i've got my 7.4 which should be

1686
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,839
plus or minus

1687
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,520
0.1 so some of you may already have

1688
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,680
anticipated where i'm going with this

1689
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,599
so i've got my part over here oops it's

1690
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:26,880
got some rendering issues

1691
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,520
got it and here what i've done is i've

1692
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,280
specified this whole thing

1693
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,359
so let's say i want this pin to drop in

1694
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:34,960
and just barely touch the bottom of the

1695
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,079
flange

1696
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,359
all of this adds up to 28

1697
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,640
but if each of these things is plus 0.5

1698
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,319
or plus 0.1 if they're all at minimum

1699
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,400
then my pin is far too long and if

1700
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,920
they're all at maximum and my pin isn't

1701
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,480
minimum

1702
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,400
then it's far too short and so i end up

1703
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,760
with this with this lack

1704
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,000
and that's what tolerance stack up is so

1705
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,440
the fact that i've specified these whole

1706
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,799
these things all back to back to back to

1707
00:55:58,799 --> 00:55:59,520
back to back

1708
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,200
means the machinist can make this thing

1709
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,359
oops can make this one

1710
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,640
7.6 and this one 5.1 and this one 10.1

1711
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,839
and this one 0.6 and this one 5.1 now my

1712
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:10,720
whole thing

1713
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,920
which has five dimensions in there is um

1714
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,720
a full

1715
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,839
uh what two millimeters long

1716
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,760
from what it should be or of 0.5

1717
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,680
millimeters so i've i've completely

1718
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,599
obliterated that nice tolerance that i

1719
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,040
had on my other thing

1720
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,559
so that's kind of the fundamental of

1721
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,079
tolerance stack up and you find this in

1722
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:28,640
places

1723
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,000
where you have back to back to back to

1724
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,240
back tolerances you want to avoid that

1725
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,599
and the way to avoid that

1726
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,720
is by specking a top to bottom dimension

1727
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,280
to cover your whole thing or you can

1728
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,200
have those limit specifications in there

1729
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,400
but when you're making your drawings if

1730
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,079
you have a critical dimension like this

1731
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,000
you definitely want to specify that

1732
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,119
similarly

1733
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,400
i have a 7.5 callout here i've got my

1734
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,040
7.4 over here but it's 7.4

1735
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,240
plus or minus 0.1 this one is 7.5

1736
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,240
plus or minus 1. so if this comes out at

1737
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,720
7.4 and my other comes out at 7.5

1738
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,920
they're both still in spec

1739
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,160
but my parts don't fit together now i've

1740
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,440
got problems

1741
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,040
so that's why you would want to use

1742
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,640
tighter tolerancing

1743
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,200
or specs and and you can you can specify

1744
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,559
the nominal dimension

1745
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,160
this 7.5 then you could say you know

1746
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,520
plus 0.2 minus 0.

1747
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,440
and that is an important thing and in

1748
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,040
your cad program if i double click on

1749
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,160
this

1750
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,359
if i double click on this double double

1751
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,400
click on this oh it's over here

1752
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,599
underneath my video thing

1753
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,680
you can't see it um it'll show me a

1754
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,440
tolerance type and i can specify

1755
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,240
symmetric

1756
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,880
deviation and limit and that's a nice

1757
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,319
way to do that so this is fusion but

1758
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:39,839
solidworks will do the same thing so

1759
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,720
pro-e

1760
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,079
all of these drawing programs will let

1761
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,839
you do that

1762
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,440
cool that's tolerance stack ups how am i

1763
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,760
doing on time we got to move quick

1764
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,839
okay so inspection you always when you

1765
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,400
order a part from a manufacturer

1766
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,839
uh want to inspect um with

1767
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,880
that um with your parts coming in

1768
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,640
you should inspect assemblies so that

1769
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,240
they fit together and that way if you

1770
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,680
have multiple parts coming from the same

1771
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,200
manufacturer you can say look they don't

1772
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:05,760
fit

1773
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,359
oftentimes a manufacturer will check

1774
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,640
them before they go out the door because

1775
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,680
manufacturers

1776
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,960
tend to have um

1777
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,599
tend to have their their own qa and they

1778
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,200
will inspect their parts

1779
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,720
check threads with known fasteners you

1780
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,000
could take an infor bolt you could put

1781
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,839
an m4 nut on it

1782
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:22,720
you can do the same thing with your

1783
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,040
parts if you specify a thread

1784
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,119
measure your stuff i recommend calipers

1785
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,799
i'm going to show you how to use those

1786
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,640
super duper fast in a second you can

1787
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,319
also buy pin gauges these are very

1788
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,200
precise

1789
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,040
basically very precise little pieces

1790
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,079
that you can stick into things to

1791
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,520
measure internal dimensions

1792
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,880
which is harder to do uh with uh

1793
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,720
calipers if you need something to be

1794
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,319
extremely flat oftentimes people will

1795
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,760
inspect on a granite flat

1796
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,280
which is a big piece of very flat

1797
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,559
granite and you can slide your piece

1798
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:49,520
across it to make sure

1799
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,880
things are parallel and that sort of

1800
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,559
stuff optical inspection is fraught

1801
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,880
um because if you're just looking at a

1802
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,160
thing your eyeballs are not that

1803
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,040
accurate

1804
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,960
if it's off to the eye then you should

1805
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,160
definitely reject it

1806
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,160
um but it's hard to inspect things

1807
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,000
optically there is an entire field of

1808
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,079
optical inspection apparatuses

1809
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,799
um and you can buy you could spend

1810
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,640
millions of dollars on inspection tools

1811
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,480
and inspect things very precisely and

1812
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,760
automatically and all that sort of stuff

1813
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,960
but you as a hobbyist

1814
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,280
don't care about that i would tend to

1815
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,040
avoid optical inspection except where

1816
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,119
it's absolutely necessary

1817
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,240
cool final thing let's talk calipers

1818
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,680
i'm going to shift you over

1819
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,119
to a thing uh

1820
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,319
nope you know what i'm just going to do

1821
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,319
it here okay so this is a pair of

1822
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,040
calipers

1823
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,079
as you can see here you can buy these on

1824
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,280
amazon

1825
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,119
for for you know 15 bucks

1826
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,839
you can spend 200 on a really nice pair

1827
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,160
uh

1828
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,480
honestly most people a 15 pair do so

1829
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,400
what happens is i scroll this open

1830
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,760
my dimensions go up and down um and so

1831
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,520
like a normal thing i can measure

1832
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,280
so i've got a paint brush right here i

1833
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,880
can measure my diameter by sticking it

1834
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,319
in there rolling back till it's

1835
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,760
firm and i can see that my paint brush

1836
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,160
diameter oops i got on the wrong part

1837
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,880
is 3.79 i'm reading this backwards in

1838
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,400
the video of myself so this is a real

1839
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,200
adventure

1840
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,960
if i'm looking to measure the internal

1841
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,640
diameter of something

1842
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,079
so i've got this spool of solder

1843
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,880
i can use the back end here and open it

1844
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,920
up

1845
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,319
until there and now i know that the

1846
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,640
inside diameter is

1847
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,680
about 21 millimeters here um

1848
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,520
the final one that i might want to do is

1849
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,880
the call what's called the depth gauge

1850
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,160
and this is kind of the hidden power of

1851
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,359
a pair of calipers

1852
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:39,280
so here i have my calipers there's a

1853
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,359
piece that comes out the bottom end

1854
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,760
here you can see it it scrolls out the

1855
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,400
bottom

1856
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,520
so i can use that i can put that inside

1857
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,119
a hole and scroll down

1858
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,200
until i hit the bottom of something so

1859
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,400
in this case a through hole i'm hitting

1860
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,520
the thing

1861
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,359
so i'm going in there until i hit and

1862
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:56,960
now i know the depth

1863
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,200
the total depth of my hole so if i have

1864
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,960
a blind hole i can measure my blind hole

1865
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,680
that way

1866
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,559
so that's a pretty cool method to use

1867
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:05,440
calipers

1868
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,640
cool i think we're basically at our hour

1869
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,599
yep i'm a minute over so conveniently i

1870
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,359
got just about an hour of stuff we're

1871
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,400
through everything

1872
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,920
just want to leave you with one final

1873
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,839
thought engineering kind of at its core

1874
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,440
is about humility

1875
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,799
you're going to work with a lot of

1876
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:24,640
people um machinists um

1877
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,559
builders things people who are building

1878
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:27,760
stuff uh

1879
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,760
never underestimate those people they

1880
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,720
are magnificent and you will learn a lot

1881
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,799
uh you will learn a lot from them in

1882
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:35,920
that so

1883
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,960
uh yeah be just be kind to the people

1884
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,839
that you're working with

1885
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:46,240
it's important
