2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,760
hello everyone

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,719
welcome to the first class of linux and

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,120
electronics at raspberry pi course

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,039
my name is pablo jarzo and this is the

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,240
first class

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,760
of the linux and electronics course uh

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,880
giving to you thanks to hakareyu

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,320
and this is gonna be a really fun class

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,519
um we're gonna see many things about the

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,280
raspberry pi we're gonna see how you're

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,920
gonna step

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,840
up your uh raspberry pi again

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,320
uh if you come from a background of

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,440
arduinos

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,600
or any other microcontrollers and you

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,520
want to use something more powerful this

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,079
is the right course for you okay

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,879
so let's do it

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,199
okay so in this first class we're going

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,039
to talk about the raspberry pi

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,680
basics what is a raspberry pi

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,719
is in short words it's the most famous

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,840
single word computer

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,159
um a raspberry pi is a single board

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:08,880
computer's

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,080
a computer as i as i said uh

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,880
what that means it's it means that for

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,600
example

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,960
a pc computer or a tower computer or a

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,119
desktop computer as we know it

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,799
is usually in a box which is composed by

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,680
the motherboard the ram the processor

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,159
maybe

35
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,000
a gpu a hard drive etc

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,159
and all those components are separate

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,680
from each other and you can

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,799
you can modify the computer a single

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,680
board computer

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,600
means that every part that i just

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,119
mentioned is together

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,119
it's assembled together and you cannot

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,280
take them apart

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,159
it's also a credit card size which means

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,159
it's really really small which is

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,280
the one of the favorite features from

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,000
the raspberry pi

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
it's open source of course which is

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
really really good

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,079
it means that you can ideally if you

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,560
have the means you can just

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,440
replicate the raspberry pi and and or

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,399
modify it

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,000
make it better etc it's also a great

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,440
learning platform which means that

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,480
once you take um

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
into the raspberry pi world you're gonna

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,680
see there are

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,160
lots lots of people in it you're gonna

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
see many resources

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,599
there's a lot of singapore computers out

62
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,360
there but there are not

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,600
many um

64
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,400
[Music]

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
but there are not that many uh as

66
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,280
famous and as um

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
people backed or or

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,319
or so many people use it that it's

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,519
there are so many resources so yeah this

70
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:51,920
is

71
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,400
this is one of the reasons if i want to

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,040
do a

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
long-term project with the raspberry pi

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,920
i or with a single board computer i mean

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,440
i usually take the raspberry pi

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,200
this is the difference between um

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
how does it compare between a pc and

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,959
arduino

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,200
an arduino is a microcontroller which

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,959
means it's just a single chip

81
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,480
which you make a program for it and then

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
and the mic and the microcontroller is

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,760
just gonna make the program run

84
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,080
it's gonna follow each instruction and

85
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,319
it's just only gonna do that

86
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,080
a raspberry pi is a computer

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
which has an operating system that has

88
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,799
many programs running in the background

89
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,400
a pc computer

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,959
is the same as a raspberry pi but it's

91
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,879
more powerful

92
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,680
more you can change parts it doesn't

93
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,080
have

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,920
access to the gpio etc so

95
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,680
the thing about the raspberry pi which

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,720
sits between the arduino and the pc

97
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,760
is that you can take the

98
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,680
raspberry pi and it has gpios in it

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,280
if you want to put gpios on the pc

100
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,599
you can have them it's not as easy as in

101
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,239
the raspberry pi

102
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,400
and obviously it's not that it's not

103
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,239
that small either

104
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,238
so this is why the raspberry pi it sits

105
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,880
between a pc project and arduino project

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,320
so what are the specs right what we're

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,720
seeing

108
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,440
here is the raspberry pi 4. the one that

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,000
we

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
we we asked you to to buy for this

111
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,759
course is a raspberry pi

112
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,800
3b you could have also buy

113
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,120
uh bought this one and it would have

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,240
been fine

115
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,800
but i i wanted to go with the 3b because

116
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
it has it

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,520
it already has many years out and it has

118
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,560
been proven to be a really good product

119
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,759
so here as you can see uh first the

120
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,919
power supply comes from a usb

121
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,320
usb c port this is for the raspberry pi

122
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,360
4. there's a

123
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,280
the razer pi 3 has a micro usb one

124
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,199
um here is what usually is the the

125
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,479
processor is

126
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,960
this looks maybe looks different

127
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,759
different

128
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,639
in yours in your raspberry pi 3 it may

129
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,680
be look like this

130
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,840
ship um here in the raspberry pi 4 you

131
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,479
can choose

132
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,199
the ram there there are many there are

133
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,039
three models that you can choose from

134
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,680
and you can have uh different amounts of

135
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,720
ram

136
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,720
here this uh system of a chip

137
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,360
on a ship that you can see here is is

138
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,840
called is is the bluetooth and wi-fi

139
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,400
chip it comes shielded so it doesn't

140
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,160
have interference

141
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,240
um from the outside

142
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,440
these are two micro hdmi ports

143
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,120
uh the the raspberry 3 this is another

144
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,240
reason why one you

145
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,360
wanted youtube to buy the raspberry pi 3

146
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,720
is because the micro hdmi ports are

147
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,840
are kind of rare so i wanted you to to

148
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,639
buy the

149
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,639
full hdmi port for the raspberry pi

150
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,160
here is a support for

151
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,199
another kind of display and here

152
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,520
is the perform for for the raspberry pi

153
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,960
camera

154
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,880
here is a jack for audio

155
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,160
usb 2 usb

156
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,000
3 and a gigabit ethernet

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,800
in the raspberry pi 3 that you have it's

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
also the same

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,319
but but no usb 3.

160
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,199
so 12 million 500

161
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,960
is the amount of raspberry pi that have

162
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,720
been sold since

163
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,199
2012 where it was born

164
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,759
that's a lot that's a lot of raspberry

165
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,280
pies out there

166
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,599
this is why i like about it there are so

167
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,560
many out

168
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,039
people are using it making products

169
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,560
making projects and

170
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
they all share their their experiences

171
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,638
in the internet

172
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,639
so here are a couple of modules um

173
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,759
the raspberry pi uh 4b is the one that

174
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,120
we just saw

175
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,319
this is a raspberry pi model 3 model b

176
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,039
this is the one that i asked we asked

177
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,960
you to buy

178
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,880
a raspberry pi 0w and raspberry pi

179
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,960
zero so as you can see this is a

180
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,160
different form factor

181
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,520
this is um kind of if

182
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,599
the size of the raspberry pi 3 if you

183
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,840
split it right in the middle

184
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,240
the raspberry pi zero is a lot cheaper

185
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,759
it's a lot less powerful

186
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,199
but it's a lot less um is a lot less

187
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,319
smaller

188
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,560
it's way smaller i should say um

189
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,360
as you can see here you have a couple of

190
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,919
things

191
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,560
from from the other uh from bigger

192
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
raspberry pi

193
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,199
here you have i what i believe is a mini

194
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,639
hdmi

195
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,160
uh two micro uh usb ports

196
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,759
the processor and the and the micro sd

197
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,000
port and i don't know if this is the

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,400
uh display port or the camera or most

199
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,520
likely the camera one

200
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
so the difference between the raspberry

201
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,720
pi zero w

202
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,160
and the zero is that the serial w is

203
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,919
wireless so you can connect through

204
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,280
wi-fi with it

205
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,680
this one the raspberry pi zero it

206
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,039
doesn't it doesn't have

207
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,080
any any kind of wireless connection so

208
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,159
everything should you should you should

209
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,279
be able

210
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,200
if you want to talk to it you you're

211
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,719
gonna be

212
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,800
talking through the usb cable

213
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,839
this is another kind of module this is

214
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,600
for industrial um

215
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,880
computing this is where you want

216
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,200
um something that you can take off and

217
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,320
on

218
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
these modules come um it's the third

219
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
generation so it's along with the

220
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,200
raspberry pi 3b

221
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,480
they come in sizes uh

222
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,440
like ram and you can and you can buy

223
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
module kits or you just make

224
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,000
you can images on your own board and put

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
them in and take them out

226
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,839
as you wish

227
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,720
so raspberry pi has something called

228
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,560
hats

229
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,360
um they were introduced in 2014

230
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,399
and they they are um

231
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
some on a standard that the the

232
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,480
raspberry pi foundation made

233
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,839
so you can if you ever do a project

234
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,839
you can have the same pinout between the

235
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,240
between um

236
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,680
raspberry pi's um it's it's the same

237
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,320
ones

238
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,360
since uh i i believe since the beginning

239
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,720
and and you can and you and whatever hat

240
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,600
was made from

241
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
for the raspberry pi let's say one or

242
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
two is gonna work for the

243
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,480
three or four

244
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,880
so these are the peanuts that you're

245
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,360
gonna

246
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,800
find in the raspberry pi um they don't

247
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,320
change a lot between them

248
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,959
because that's that's uh they try to

249
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,560
keep these standard

250
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
you're gonna see a couple of for example

251
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,839
five volts

252
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,959
pins 3.3 volts

253
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,000
ground pin a couple of them actually

254
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,160
you're also going to see a lot of gpios

255
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,279
with also

256
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,720
double as serial buses

257
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
for example i square c these are the two

258
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
bosses for it

259
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,959
and serial serial ports

260
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,920
and and more uh there's also

261
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,079
pwms and and

262
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,760
more ports we're going to talk about

263
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,600
them more in the next classes

264
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,360
so this is what a um raspberry pi had

265
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,680
looked like this is one type of it

266
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,399
someone

267
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,519
decided to make a hat with leds

268
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,040
addressable as you can see it sits on

269
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,360
top

270
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,839
of the raspberry pi and it makes a an

271
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,040
animation

272
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,120
that could have just been a program made

273
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,240
into it or

274
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,440
something that happened once uh one

275
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,040
condition happened for example if you

276
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,680
got an email or something like that

277
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,720
this is the primary unicorn hat uh you

278
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,079
can find it if you want it

279
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,120
but this is really cool this is another

280
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,160
example

281
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,320
i don't know if you can notice but this

282
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,680
easy hat

283
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,720
for the raspberry pi zero

284
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,560
it could have been also the w but the uh

285
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,600
it's the it's compatible still um

286
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,279
compatible and this also could have

287
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,600
went into the raspberry pi 3 but it's

288
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,639
but the thing is

289
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,040
it's not going it was not going to be as

290
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,760
um

291
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,959
comfortable as a joystick for it so this

292
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,160
is really cool

293
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,040
this is just someone made this to make a

294
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,279
a

295
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,320
full um a full

296
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,560
um video game out of a raspberry pi zero

297
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,160
in a controller and in a raspberry pi

298
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,199
uh zero hat

299
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,800
okay so at first when i saw this uh it

300
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,160
it was it kind of blew my mind because

301
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,440
it's really really really small um

302
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,480
as you can see is this is a

303
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,399
an arcade cabinet made with a couple of

304
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,079
pcbs um or

305
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,399
uh per four pcbs so they solder a couple

306
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:52,720
of

307
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,680
um buttons and a joystick or a mini

308
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
joystick

309
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,720
a a lcd screen and they connect

310
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,560
and they connected everything to a

311
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,720
raspberry pi zero

312
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,560
this is another kind of project and this

313
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
is the project that you usually see

314
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,160
when you are working with um

315
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,240
with uh people that come from a linux

316
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,600
background

317
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,279
they usually make something called

318
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,720
cluster which

319
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,760
means that you put a couple of computing

320
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,040
computing power which can be

321
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,120
um processors gpus etc

322
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,880
you can put a couple of uh

323
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,519
raspberry pi's and make a cluster out of

324
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,160
it

325
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,680
so here the raspberry pi 3

326
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,360
is working as a bit like the host and

327
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,920
they made a hat so you can fit a couple

328
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,160
of raspberry pi zeros on top of it

329
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,440
to make a cluster so this is the cluster

330
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,160
hat

331
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,360
uh 2.5 by palmer pine moroni if you want

332
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,839
to find

333
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,360
more about it so here

334
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,079
what is linux right this is a linux and

335
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,519
electronic course so we're going to

336
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,440
explain what linux is

337
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,199
linux in basic words are an open source

338
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,560
operating system it's an operating

339
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,360
system same

340
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,440
same as um windows and and

341
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,839
and the operating system from uh from

342
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:24,560
mac which

343
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,600
uh the name i just forgot

344
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,959
wait a second

345
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,480
so linux is an operating system um

346
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,760
same as windows and mac os um

347
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,680
and it's open source this is something

348
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,279
that the other ones

349
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,000
doesn't doesn't have uh they come

350
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,240
packaged into many distributions so

351
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,880
types of clinic that like there's

352
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,560
imagine there were kinds of

353
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,839
windows they they come

354
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,880
a couple of linux distributions

355
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,040
uh the the most a couple of the most

356
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,320
um famous ones are ubuntu

357
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,920
deviant raspberry pi os and

358
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,519
and more they are really really

359
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,920
linux is really really popular for

360
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,399
servers and iot because it's open source

361
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,920
easy to work with and the the

362
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,519
um the operating system

363
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,600
is very secure and reliable

364
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,040
center it it was made to be reliable and

365
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,360
to be

366
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,839
easy to use for big and complicated

367
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,880
purposes

368
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,800
this is what we know as a linux console

369
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,079
or terminal

370
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,160
this is where you're gonna interact with

371
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,079
the operating system and this is what

372
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,199
we're gonna use in the next classes to

373
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,680
do commands talk um to the to the

374
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,560
to the computer make programs etc

375
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,000
i know this this looks really really um

376
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,040
complicated but

377
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,079
it is really not so in this diagram

378
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,480
i'm showing you the the the the

379
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,759
connections between shell

380
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,360
internal and the hardware and the user

381
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,279
so the shell the char is a program

382
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,959
that interprets the

383
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,240
commands that you that you

384
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,440
that you typed in as an user send that

385
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,199
information to the kernel

386
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,279
which is the part of the operating

387
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,320
system

388
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,680
that talks to the hardware so let's say

389
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,639
drivers um let's say special programs

390
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,360
that that

391
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,880
that only the hardware can can um

392
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,600
special programs to talk to the hardware

393
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,399
this is basically the kernel

394
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,600
and the chill is there are many type of

395
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,399
shells but

396
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,839
like um shells

397
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,880
are usually the program that accepts the

398
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,079
commands okay

399
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,160
so this is a step down

400
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,199
for for how it goes from

401
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,839
application to hardware so you use an

402
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,240
application uh

403
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,439
you open a chrome spotify or you on your

404
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,400
terminal

405
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,119
you do a cd or mv to move

406
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,480
and you do if you do those commands

407
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,200
or if you run those programs they

408
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
usually gonna run on a chill

409
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,559
they're gonna run on a terminal and

410
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,600
they're gonna run

411
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,760
uh for example um sh

412
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,200
csh or bash are three examples of

413
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,160
shells these are the most famous ones

414
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,360
okay

415
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,280
so um then then the shell is gonna talk

416
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,160
to the kernel

417
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
and then the kernel as we said is gonna

418
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,840
talk to the hardware

419
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,720
so what is electronics electronics is

420
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
one of the coolest in my opinion is one

421
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,080
of the coolest branch

422
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,200
of physics electronics is

423
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,799
um the field that studies the flows

424
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,880
the flow of electrons within semi

425
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,000
with the semiconductors so

426
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
same technically when you're uh

427
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,400
switching a a

428
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,200
a light in your house on and off just

429
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,080
you're

430
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,320
um

431
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,320
controlling the flow of electrons

432
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,720
but it's not with it's not small it's

433
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
not that that korean is not

434
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
uh small it's you're not doing it with

435
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,160
semiconductors

436
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,440
so what i the analogy that i like to use

437
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,559
for example for electronics

438
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,640
is that um electr

439
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,080
the difference between electronics and

440
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,000
electrical or electricity

441
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,280
is that electrical uh usually works with

442
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,240
things are more power and bigger

443
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,840
electronics is where

444
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,880
when you wanna uh where where you

445
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,520
deal with smaller stuff and more

446
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,600
dedicated stuff

447
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,039
in in in

448
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,840
in practice the difference usually comes

449
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,559
with

450
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,960
what are you using for example in

451
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,840
electronics we

452
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,520
mostly use transistors or

453
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,400
microcontrollers to do our controlling

454
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,160
in electricity we you use um

455
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,160
relays um controls plc

456
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,520
whatever things are big and robust

457
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,039
to to take those currents

458
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,080
um electronics are or things that are

459
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,480
also

460
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,520
used in the electronics field are

461
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,640
microcontrollers asics and fpgas

462
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,200
asic is an application of it and you can

463
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,039
find that out but it's like a little

464
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,520
bit advanced i just wanted to say that

465
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,720
and fpgas

466
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,159
are like the next step is is when you

467
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,480
when you when you get to the limits of

468
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
the microcontroller where the

469
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,559
microcontroller cannot run fast enough

470
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,400
for you to do something then you need to

471
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,840
run fpga

472
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,280
and fpga is the closest thing as maker

473
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,960
that we have to make our own

474
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,480
um um

475
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,240
chip or make our own uh

476
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,200
integrated circuit that's that's the

477
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,320
best way i can put it

478
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,120
so this is a pcb from 1966.

479
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,200
this is what it looks electronic

480
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,159
electronics

481
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,400
look like um this as you can see it has

482
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,760
many many integrated circuits in on top

483
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,200
of a pcb

484
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,120
switches as capacitors

485
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,840
and some resistors over here more

486
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
capacitors

487
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,960
yeah so the difference between this

488
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,799
macbook pro logic board from the 2010

489
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,799
and this it's basically that

490
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,640
first of all we advance at a point that

491
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,520
integrated circuits are way smaller so

492
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,880
mostly everything

493
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,159
that is here you can just replace it

494
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,200
with a couple of

495
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,880
chips like this one and this one

496
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,799
and yeah so we have more more populated

497
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,840
uh the pcb is more popular than this one

498
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,400
because we're being more efficient as

499
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,360
you can see

500
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,320
these are like the cables on top of the

501
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,039
pcb

502
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,480
pcb means printed circuit board so

503
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,440
it's it would be like instead of cables

504
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,200
it would be like the cable would be

505
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,720
drawn on top of the pcb imagine the pcb

506
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,440
being like

507
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,650
a a top um

508
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,799
[Music]

509
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,480
sheet of plastic and he had and it has

510
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,520
copper on top and at the bottom

511
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,200
and the cables are drawn

512
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,840
on top and and and and down to it okay

513
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,400
here we have the same but we don't have

514
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,120
as many

515
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,159
layers what i just described you that it

516
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,720
goes on top and the bottom are layers

517
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,440
this board has many layers probably more

518
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:29,840
than

519
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,440
ten and yeah

520
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
so here are you as you can see we are

521
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,120
this board is completely populated with

522
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,080
stuff so

523
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,720
this means that we just been way more

524
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,280
efficient

525
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
so let's talk about a little bit about

526
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,880
the raspberry pi os

527
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,039
previously no one previously known as

528
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,000
raspbian so

529
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,640
i just noticed that um they just changed

530
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,320
the name from raspbian

531
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,600
to um raspberry pi os which is um

532
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,640
an okay um change

533
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,480
so yeah so just be mindful when you find

534
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,600
uh when you wanna

535
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,559
to look for um help on the internet if

536
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,760
you want something that it

537
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,200
you can see it's a problem that could be

538
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,919
really old you may you may be

539
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,280
uh needing to put raspbian on your query

540
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,360
on google

541
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,840
so this is the raspberry pi os desktop

542
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,159
this is what it looks like when you go

543
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,280
when you go inside of it

544
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,720
it looks like a typical desktop but a

545
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,840
few changes

546
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,200
right here is the the hour the um

547
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,840
the volume control wi-fi status

548
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,640
bluetooth

549
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,000
status um here's for the usb

550
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,880
uh i believe this is the uh amount of

551
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,480
percent that the cpu

552
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,159
is using so here are

553
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,000
the the the main menu

554
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,840
here you can see here's where you shut

555
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,320
down the the raspberry pi

556
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,120
um or reboot it this is where you run

557
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,679
commands

558
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,400
preferences for the raspberry pi os

559
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,679
system

560
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,960
uh account and in here are programs

561
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,120
just packed into different categories

562
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,039
so the difference between the raspberry

563
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,720
pi os um desktop

564
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,960
and the minimal version that we're gonna

565
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,120
see a little bit later but i just wanted

566
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,039
to explain this to you

567
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,080
is that the minimal doesn't have

568
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,960
any desktop doesn't have any uh gui

569
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,600
which means

570
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,720
graphical user interface uh basically

571
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,600
gui is

572
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,760
what whenever you you can

573
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,279
move the mouse or use the keyboard

574
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,480
it's a uh to change stuff or basically

575
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,000
the mouse

576
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,279
um is a gui here on the raspberry pi

577
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,480
minimum you cannot

578
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,440
like you cannot use the mouse you may be

579
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,960
using it

580
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,919
but not directly

581
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,320
so we here we mostly use the keyboard

582
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,559
so we type everything that we want and

583
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,840
this is better

584
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,880
for some applications because gui

585
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,480
um takes uh many resources to put

586
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,000
pixels by pixels um in each frame

587
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,720
it takes a lot of power so whenever you

588
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,919
want to do something

589
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,720
that is not um that you want to the the

590
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,279
most

591
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,400
uh the most out of the raspberry pi you

592
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:38,960
should go

593
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,159
through to minimal i usually use minimal

594
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,679
um for example you cannot do

595
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,120
on computer uh vision applications

596
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,360
with the raspberry pi os minimal you

597
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,279
need to use the raspberry pi

598
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,880
um desktop for that because it's not

599
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
gonna allow you even to download

600
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,159
or install some programs

601
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,559
um so yeah so to have that in mind

602
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,200
so if you go to the raspberry pi

603
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,559
downloads

604
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,880
page of the raspberry pi foundation

605
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,919
you're going to see

606
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,200
two types of raspberry pi

607
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,640
os options you're gonna

608
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,080
you're gonna choose the raspberry pi os

609
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,120
previously uh called raspbian and choose

610
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,600
that one

611
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,440
and then you're gonna see a couple of

612
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,320
third-party operating system images

613
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,919
it's this this you're gonna see it below

614
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,120
this

615
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,240
so this me these are a couple of um

616
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,480
images or let's say you can you can

617
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,799
maybe call them distributions

618
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,000
um for the raspberry pi as you can see

619
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,240
um there are uh versions of ubuntu i

620
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,200
want to make core

621
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,679
and server for the raspberry pi these

622
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,200
are another kind

623
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,240
of um raspberry pi images

624
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,279
for the raspberry pi i haven't um

625
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,640
test them all um so yeah if

626
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,760
whatever you want to do on internet of

627
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,960
things applications you

628
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,000
may be you may want to look for for

629
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,840
these images

630
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,399
before downloading them and trying them

631
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,320
out

632
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,240
so again we're gonna touch the raspberry

633
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
pi os one

634
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,399
and then we're gonna see three options

635
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,520
okay

636
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,000
so let me explain these three options

637
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
for you

638
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,480
so on top of that both of them are the

639
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,679
desktop versions

640
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,559
okay the the the bottom one is the

641
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,440
debian

642
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,159
the raspberry pi slide

643
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,399
if you can see there's a a big

644
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,960
difference in sizes for example

645
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,600
here there's a raspberry pi os light

646
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,039
just weights only

647
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,360
um size is only 435 megabytes

648
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,320
uh and the raspberry pi os with the

649
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,159
desktop

650
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,120
it it weighs on one gigabyte the

651
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,919
raspberry pi

652
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,320
os with the desktop and the recommended

653
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,440
software

654
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,039
it weighs 2.5 gigabytes so

655
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,480
what is the difference between these two

656
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,880
you may ask here this one

657
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,080
comes with um some programs um

658
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,600
suggested if you want to use the

659
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,679
raspberry pi as a full computer

660
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,960
if you don't have any computer and you

661
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,039
want to use this one

662
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,039
uh i mean if you one uh if you want to

663
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,880
use the raspberry pi as a full computer

664
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,679
you may you you want to choose this one

665
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,320
because

666
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,520
it already comes with a word processor

667
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,720
a um excel like program

668
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,399
etc this one is which is the one that

669
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,919
we're going to use

670
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,799
gonna comes with a few programs but it's

671
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:57,679
not going to be

672
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,880
like uh full of it so

673
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,240
if if we ever need a program um

674
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,480
and we we're gonna we're gonna download

675
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,799
some programs

676
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,240
you're gonna download you're gonna use

677
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
this one okay then

678
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,520
download this one and this is the one

679
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,799
that we're going to be using in this

680
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,880
class

681
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,000
so let's do a checklist for the things

682
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,039
that you

683
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,399
have you need to have for this first

684
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,760
class you need to have the image file

685
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,919
downloaded

686
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,880
um this is in case the this is gonna be

687
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,080
depending on the

688
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,919
on the method but i suggest you to

689
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,600
download it anyways it's really good to

690
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,880
have it

691
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,080
a unzip tool to take

692
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,000
um the the image out of the

693
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,600
zip file that is gonna come

694
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,120
the and then the flasher

695
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,080
which you're going to use either ballina

696
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,399
etcher or the raspberry pi imager which

697
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:58,880
is a

698
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
really uh is a new program from the

699
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,720
raspberry pi foundation

700
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,919
this is the one that we're going to use

701
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,000
today the raspberry pi imager but you

702
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,559
can use

703
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,840
both it's really simple the one of the

704
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,640
i'm sorry one of the process uh the

705
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,840
process of using

706
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,440
a image file on the baleno etcher is

707
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,000
also

708
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,840
available to do on the raspberry pi

709
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,880
imager

710
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,799
so let's start flashing the raspberry pi

711
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,279
so here

712
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,880
so here this is the raspberry pi imager

713
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,080
um

714
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,640
you may have a another one by the time

715
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
you see this video

716
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,360
but yeah this is where we choose the

717
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,159
type of operating system that we have

718
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,120
if we had the image file that image file

719
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,480
or amg file downloaded

720
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,559
you can you can use use custom and then

721
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,000
you can select this one

722
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,559
i have this one because of the um

723
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,600
uh i had this one because of a project

724
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,000
that i was

725
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,960
doing and and this is an image for for

726
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,760
using it

727
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,799
with the 3d printer

728
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,159
i'm going to choose this one the

729
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,159
raspberry pi os 32 bits

730
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,399
and i'm gonna choose this

731
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,880
i have the sd card that comes with the

732
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,559
raspberry pi connected

733
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,200
uh to my laptop which is what i'm using

734
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,480
right now

735
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,600
so i'm just gonna click right

736
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,279
and it's i'm gonna go

737
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,080
so yeah this process takes a little bit

738
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,399
um first of all it's gonna take all the

739
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,679
files from the image

740
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,519
and it's gonna um unzip it and then it's

741
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,960
gonna burn it into the

742
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,720
to the uh flash to the sd flash

743
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,360
then it's gonna validate it and then

744
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,640
we're going to be able to use them

745
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:15,840
so let's wait a little bit for it

746
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,720
so yeah as you can see it's taking a

747
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
little bit right

748
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,560
um that i i like to do this in the

749
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,280
background

750
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,160
whenever i want to uh before before i

751
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,920
need to start working on it

752
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,520
i usually put the put that in the

753
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,440
background and then when it's finished i

754
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,200
i'm ready to go

755
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,240
so yeah after this writing

756
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,560
part is going it's going to verify it

757
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,880
hopefully it goes well

758
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,320
and then we're gonna be uh ready

759
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,400
to to keep to keep uh working with the

760
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,680
raspberry pi

761
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,480
so let's wait a little bit more and so

762
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
yeah

763
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,720
as you can see now we're verifying um

764
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,200
the

765
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,320
that everything went well and yeah this

766
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,880
part is

767
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,440
way faster uh so we should be able to

768
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,920
finish

769
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,560
this really really quick so yeah um

770
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,839
we're just gonna wait here

771
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,839
me

772
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,839
music

773
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,839
um

774
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,839
so

775
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,359
okay we are almost done everything

776
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,359
uh have you been you cannot remove the

777
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,440
st card from the reader

778
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,560
okay good good good good so everything

779
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:34,880
went

780
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,960
wrong so this is a really important part

781
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,000
don't take the usb or the micro usb

782
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,520
out or the sd card don't take it out

783
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,440
of your computer yet make sure

784
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,839
to do to go to your computer

785
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,030
um wait to go to your

786
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,839
[Music]

787
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,760
um

788
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,400
here to your files here um to your pc

789
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,440
okay it's out but make sure to be to to

790
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,560
to have it out of your computer first in

791
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,040
case

792
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,880
it's not out you click right you right

793
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,960
click it and then click eject okay this

794
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,680
is a really

795
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,280
important part i just take it out

796
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,319
i'm gonna put it back in

797
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,960
and it should be it should be displaying

798
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,440
in a bit

799
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:45,839
let's wait a bit let's wait a second

800
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,399
for some reason is not recognizing it

801
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:13,440
let me see something

802
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:27,839
that can happen

803
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:09,839
let's wait a second

804
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,079
so now we're gonna put the memory

805
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:37,520
the usb back in or the i or the sd card

806
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,200
and this should be appearing here yeah

807
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,160
so here uh it's something that we're

808
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,599
gonna have and that we're gonna use in a

809
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,560
bit so

810
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,640
let's stick to let's stick together for

811
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,599
that

812
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,160
so the other option that you had was

813
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,720
that

814
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,839
using baleno etcher which is

815
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,680
kind of the same you just click the

816
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,280
select the image is gonna pop

817
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,760
the window for you to select the dot

818
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,720
image file

819
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,400
select the drive that you're gonna

820
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,000
choose the one that you just connect to

821
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,520
the computer and then flash

822
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,960
it's gonna do the same process it's

823
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,200
gonna be burning very fine

824
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,240
in case it it goes wrong uh you do it

825
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,640
again

826
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,040
in case it doesn't it doesn't work maybe

827
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,040
you need to um

828
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,640
um wipe your sd card

829
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,040
again or reformat it which is something

830
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,000
that that you can

831
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,800
uh that that may happen so i suggest you

832
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,200
if

833
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,640
you haven't that kind of trouble i

834
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,560
suggest usual to look for it

835
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,119
on the hackadayu page for this course

836
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:35,680
which

837
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,560
uh we have in the class notes a couple

838
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:38,800
of

839
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,680
useful links for that so yeah

840
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,520
if you need to format i suggest you to

841
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,440
do it yeah there's also an option in the

842
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,680
raspberry pi imager to do that

843
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,319
let's plus here let's see here's this

844
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,040
one

845
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,200
you can see there's a way to format the

846
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,520
card

847
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,319
and then flash the sd card with an

848
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:02,960
imager

849
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,800
you can use the raspberry pi imager as

850
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,000
we just use or use the baleno etcher

851
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,560
eject the memory from your computer

852
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,839
right

853
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,400
and then plug it in again this is what

854
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,359
we're going to do

855
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,400
the wi-fi configuration and that's ssh

856
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,520
config configuration so it's always

857
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,240
first

858
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,200
before using them so connect the sd back

859
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,640
up into your computer does

860
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,920
that's what we just did and for the

861
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,800
ssh we're gonna use we're gonna right

862
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,480
click and create a file

863
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,960
named ssh we're gonna close this i'm

864
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,920
gonna go to

865
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,160
boot and here we're gonna create a file

866
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,040
called a text file called without

867
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,880
anything yes no extensions so

868
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,160
you notice that that i created a txt

869
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,720
file

870
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,160
delete that just ssh the computer

871
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,560
the raspberry pi once you pop this out

872
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,280
and put

873
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,200
put it in the raspberry pi this is going

874
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,200
to recognize it as a permission

875
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,480
to to to get um connections through

876
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,280
ssh from outside the raspberry pi which

877
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,240
is

878
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,280
what we're going to be using to talk to

879
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,240
that raspberry pi

880
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,920
in the next chord in the next class um

881
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,920
have this in mind this is not something

882
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,680
that you need to understand right now

883
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,760
the next class is gonna be better

884
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,800
it's gonna be a little bit more detailed

885
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,880
for the wi-fi so

886
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,000
for the wi-fi it's kind of the same

887
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,280
you need to go to here and edit i

888
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,599
i i put it at it but you need to create

889
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,000
as well

890
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,920
we're going to use the same name here

891
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,920
wpa

892
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,559
supplicant dot config

893
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:04,559
configuration.com

894
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,160
yes and we

895
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,160
click and then as you can see this is

896
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,000
the final example that comes

897
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,440
um uh on your on your

898
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,359
uh for the um wi-fi configuration

899
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,480
file be aware that this

900
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,720
step is not necessary configuration you

901
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,680
don't need to do it

902
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,000
like it's not required this is i'm

903
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,839
showing you just a way to do it

904
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,440
so what

905
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,400
what what is requires to do the ssh so

906
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,160
have that in mind the ssh

907
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,400
you need to do it the wi-fi you don't

908
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,000
need to do it

909
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,200
so i'm just gonna type that part

910
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,839
network

911
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,960
ssid

912
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,480
um let's use test as the

913
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,599
the the wi-fi network that i want wanted

914
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:10,319
to go

915
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,520
and psk is going to be the password

916
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,760
so i'm just going to put here uh one two

917
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,880
three four five six

918
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,760
seven eight five this is just an example

919
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,599
right

920
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,520
i'm gonna save this and set

921
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,319
okay so you gonna very important

922
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,280
don't take out the memory card just

923
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,280
every every time

924
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,119
just eject it

925
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:45,599
we're gonna wait we're gonna wait

926
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,160
and then

927
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,160
should be good there you go

928
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,359
so i'm just gonna take it out and

929
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,119
everything should be set to put

930
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,680
on the raspberry pi so now you're gonna

931
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,000
go and boot up your raspberry pi

932
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,200
connected to your um to your

933
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,480
monitor connect the the the keyboard the

934
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,520
mouse

935
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,839
and then you're gonna connect the power

936
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,800
so you should go it should look

937
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,720
something like this once it goes on

938
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,640
and you're gonna type you're gonna open

939
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,800
a terminal that you're gonna look for

940
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,319
in the top left corner as we saw and

941
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,160
you're gonna type sudo apt

942
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,720
update which is gonna download every

943
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,359
update that

944
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,400
it should be it that it needs okay this

945
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,400
process also takes a little while

946
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,920
so i also do that and put it in the

947
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,160
background and then you're gonna do a

948
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,480
full

949
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,559
upgrade which is gonna take everything

950
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,839
that you downloaded

951
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,800
and it's gonna uh apply it and and and

952
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,520
and

953
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,480
it's gonna upgrade every program that it

954
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,040
has

955
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,359
um that is all

956
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,079
so this is what's the first class um

957
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,720
i hope you liked it uh any questions

958
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,440
that you have

00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,960
for the raspberry pi course and

964
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,760
see you on the next club i will see you

965
