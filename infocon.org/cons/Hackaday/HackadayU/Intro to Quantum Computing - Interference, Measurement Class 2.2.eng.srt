00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,240
welcome everybody

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,840
this is our 11th hackaday session

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,680
on quantum computing and for

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,199
new communities joining us two weeks ago

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,039
that's the third session

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,480
and for people who are new today

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,359
this is where we post everything all the

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,399
information

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,520
and the class

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,559
i update with comics every week

12
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,320
so our hackaday comics

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,559
introduction to quantum computing you

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,000
will find all of the

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,800
recordings from past sessions every

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,920
sunday we meet

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,960
for 20 30 to one hour

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,760
usually i try to keep it within 30

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,480
minutes to discuss a concept

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,719
and then we can answer some questions

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,280
and do some discussions after that

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,400
we also use the q sharp documentation on

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,439
the microsoft

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,000
documentation website and the quantum

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
cutouts for our

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,240
coding exercise

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,640
last class and two classes ago

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,280
we discussed superposition and this

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,479
picture shows you

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,840
kind of a landscape for learning quantum

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,000
computing

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,439
you can go pretty far with the

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,560
q sharp exercises learning the concepts

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,520
and go to

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,200
all these linear algebra or algorithms

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,320
that you can

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,640
express using the quantum language q

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
sharp

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,119
so today we're going to discuss this

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,040
very exciting and interesting

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,479
subject uh interference and that's built

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,119
onto

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,079
what we learned so far so mainly

44
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,000
superposition concepts

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,159
for people who have been to this

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,079
hackaday classes this would be a

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,159
revision but i will also show you some

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,119
of the new

49
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,680
pages and talk a little bit about

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,399
physics too

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
just a step back looking at what we

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,800
discovered two classes in the past two

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
classes

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,080
the quantum bits and superpositions so

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,120
you should know that a qubit can be

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,760
expressed

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,200
as a vector which in turn is also

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,319
a superposition of these two

59
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,519
states zero or one there

60
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,160
each of them would have a amplitude

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,840
associated with them

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,080
telling you how much of the 0 and 1 are

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,599
in the system

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,319
all you need is that you have this

65
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,959
normalization condition where

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,280
no matter how many states you have in

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,080
your system

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,720
your amplitude squared needs to be add

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,080
up to one

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,159
so some examples like how you can

71
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,720
use a metaphor to express qubits you

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,560
could have

73
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,879
probabilities of one-third and

74
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,400
two-thirds

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,720
coexisting and you can have

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,920
probabilities of

77
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,120
mixed-colored uh beads or

78
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,680
spinning coins with half a half

79
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,720
probability of landing a head or tails

80
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,680
so this amplitude square means

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,800
probability of

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,879
each state and when you have multiple

83
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,599
qubits

84
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,000
you would just add all of them up that's

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,840
what is called superposition which is

86
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
also linear combination of these

87
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,720
different states each of them will have

88
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,400
these amplitudes

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
and you just time them uh square them

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,560
and add up to one as you grow your your

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,120
qubits

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,159
number of cubits the possible states

93
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,680
that could be in your system

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,280
grows when you have lots of qubits you

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
would just

96
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,959
you would not just keep writing all the

97
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:57,840
outcomes

98
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,040
you would just use a summation to say

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,519
that

100
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,439
i will sum up all of the possible

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,599
configurations in my system and each of

102
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,159
them with an amplitude

103
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,080
we mentioned that the amplitude can be

104
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,000
any number it could be

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,399
real numbers like 1 to 1 half one third

106
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,120
they could be negative numbers but they

107
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,399
could also be

108
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,320
imaginary numbers so in general they can

109
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,120
be complex numbers the amplitudes

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,160
can take all these different

111
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,919
phases the the forms so then um

112
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,000
some people i'm really glad that um

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,120
olivia i think

114
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,400
that is who asked on hackaday comments

115
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,919
so if we want to have

116
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,560
amplitude square equal to probability

117
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
how do we deal with

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,880
the case when you have a imaginary

119
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,240
number you have this

120
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,199
i here i'm really glad that she asked

121
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,040
that so we will take a look

122
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,800
today how do you express

123
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,720
complex numbers this you have also

124
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,199
seen the last class when we wanted to

125
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,320
show a qubit

126
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,919
as in a three-dimensional space

127
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,680
but we're not talking about qubit right

128
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,960
now we're talking about

129
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,240
complex numbers when you have

130
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,360
just real number you can express it in a

131
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,639
line and the length of that just

132
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,759
indicates how

133
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,080
big your number is but then when you

134
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,520
have complex numbers you

135
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,039
give it a vertical axis

136
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,080
then you can express a complex number in

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,160
as arrow in a two-dimensional space this

138
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,479
we have seen last time

139
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,680
and you also see that it will have

140
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,440
a length it will also have a face

141
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,320
if you are measuring its relative

142
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,039
position away from the x-axis

143
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,919
so i show in this new page here you can

144
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,960
actually express

145
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,160
your complex number in two ways one is

146
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
with this cartesian

147
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,600
coordinate so x and y and you have these

148
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
a and b

149
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,479
so real number is in your x-axis

150
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,520
and complex uh imaginary number is your

151
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
vertical axis

152
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,080
so where this arrow is is basically

153
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,880
expressed as

154
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,160
the projection onto these two axes

155
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,440
a and b but you can also write it

156
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,280
in this polar coordinate

157
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,560
which has a length r and a phase

158
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
phi you can express r and

159
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,639
r and phi in terms of a and b and the

160
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,600
angle

161
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
in this diagram and you will see that

162
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
when you're trying to

163
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,199
calculate the amplitude you're doing

164
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,599
you're

165
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,960
actually doing a modular square

166
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,639
so it is absolute value square

167
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,560
but then you all quickly see that

168
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,360
because this phase here when you do a

169
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,800
square is doing a cancellation so it

170
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,080
cancels itself out

171
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,240
what it leaves is just the magnitude

172
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,440
squared

173
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,120
so basically if you have any amplitude

174
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,160
which can be your quantum

175
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,280
state then is probability

176
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,479
is just the magnitude squared uh you

177
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,280
don't have to

178
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,280
use a polar coordinate to calculate this

179
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,599
you can also just use a and b and see oh

180
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,560
actually a

181
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,199
r is always positive and squaring that

182
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,280
you get a positive number so probability

183
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,639
can never be a

184
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,520
negative number

185
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,520
that's that and then

186
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,039
what is the significance of having

187
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,400
complex or negative amplitudes

188
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,000
from our daily experience we have

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,440
seen a lot of different kinds of waves

190
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,960
we have sound waves light waves water

191
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,759
waves that's

192
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,479
in our everyday experience we already

193
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,520
know that

194
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,800
if you have some wave two waves

195
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,840
having amplitudes

196
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,960
in phase so they would

197
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,919
sync up and add up so the amplitude

198
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,599
overall

199
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,800
will grow but there are also cases where

200
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,280
they can be out of sync and they would

201
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,000
subtract each other and you get nothing

202
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,319
we know that amplitudes can add up which

203
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,880
is called a constructive interference

204
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,159
or amplitudes can cancel each other out

205
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,599
this is a destructive interference

206
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,039
so this happens in our quantum

207
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,040
mechanical system and in quantum

208
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,080
computing

209
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,959
that's actually what we deal with

210
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:49,680
because

211
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,560
we can express our qubits with the

212
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,240
amplitudes then there must be

213
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
interference going on in

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,200
our qubit systems

215
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,360
so in quantum computing

216
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,839
we deal with probabilities but

217
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
classically um we

218
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,760
we deal with absolute numbers so

219
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,120
if you now use that

220
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
interference argument and to look at

221
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,200
our systems again mapping your

222
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,680
way of understanding in terms of these

223
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
tree diagrams

224
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,560
this is what we learned as kids like how

225
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,519
do we calculate probability

226
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,440
um classically if you want to know say

227
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
tomorrow has equal probability of

228
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,600
getting a sunny day or a rainy day

229
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,160
what is the probability of the day after

230
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
tomorrow being sunny

231
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,519
if we were in a classical system

232
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,600
then we would just add up the

233
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
probabilities

234
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,200
so we need to first time down the tree

235
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,000
and we time all of these possible

236
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,880
outcomes

237
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,920
being sunny so 50

238
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,040
times 30 percent plus 50

239
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,160
times 90 these numbers are just made up

240
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,519
just any number but probability they're

241
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,000
always

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,519
positive so you get a 60

243
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,600
case in a classical system

244
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,160
but if you want to solve this in a

245
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,519
quantum

246
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,920
system or if your system is quantum

247
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,120
uh there's no reason we cannot

248
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,320
give your system a minus sign and what

249
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,720
that

250
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,839
happens what that does is uh

251
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,440
i just arbitrarily put a minus there

252
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,720
and because we're dealing with amplitude

253
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,000
we would label the amplitude

254
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,440
the square root of the probabilities

255
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,000
and i can arbitrarily put a minus sign

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,040
there

257
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,279
what that does is even though you

258
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,920
have a actual path to get a sunny day

259
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,040
that negative sign actually can subtract

260
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,480
and reduce your probability of having a

261
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,680
sunny day

262
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,519
this is what's really weird about

263
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,839
quantum system is that

264
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,720
even if you have more ways to get to

265
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,519
where you are

266
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,440
it could play a negative role so this

267
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
example turns out to give you eight

268
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,480
percent

269
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,680
of getting a sunny day this is what

270
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,480
happens when you want to do a

271
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,880
measurement on your system

272
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800
is the amplitude that does the

273
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,560
constructive and destructive

274
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,839
interference that leads to your

275
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,959
result so

276
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,920
if you're observing certain results in a

277
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,360
quantum system

278
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,079
that means that that particular result

279
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,839
before you measure it

280
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,680
it would have constructive

281
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
amplitudes all adding their

282
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
probabilities up

283
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,480
so the other possible outcomes are

284
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,680
eliminated

285
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,600
by those destructive interference that's

286
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,040
why you do not measure those

287
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,240
unlikely results and that's

288
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,519
what we get in measurements to

289
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,720
to have a little bit more

290
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,839
to read a bit more formal

291
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,680
description of that classic code

292
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,519
and quantum probability theory

293
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,959
scott erinson has given quite a lot of

294
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,760
interesting

295
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,880
write-ups and lectures in his own works

296
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,440
so i recommend you to look it up and

297
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,680
it is called a one norm for the

298
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,720
classical case

299
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,920
and two norm for the quantum mechanical

300
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,399
case

301
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,519
so we will not go into too much depth

302
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,480
here but the

303
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,600
point here is that

304
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,839
we are dealing with amplitudes in

305
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,560
quantum systems and the amplitudes can

306
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,360
be positive

307
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,040
negative or even complex

308
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,560
and that's what leads to interference

309
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,279
as well as measurements it's not just

310
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,480
something that

311
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,079
we cannot observe because quantum

312
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,600
mechanical systems uh typically are in

313
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,720
very small scale

314
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,920
and very cold but there are actually

315
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,440
measurements that we have

316
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,519
observed that's directly expressing this

317
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,560
interference for example this double

318
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,880
slit experiment that is

319
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,000
very famous now you probably heard of it

320
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,600
sometime in your study

321
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,000
there you can create an experiment

322
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,920
that you would have two slits

323
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,480
letting electron beams to go through and

324
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,959
we know

325
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,199
electrons are intrinsically quantum

326
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,240
mechanical

327
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,120
particles they will behave in a quantum

328
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,399
way

329
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,480
if you close one of the slits you would

330
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,040
get this distribution that most of the

331
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,760
electrons

332
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,040
would appear close to the slit in the

333
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,880
center and you would

334
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,199
you would think you in a classical way

335
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,279
if this

336
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,639
slit gets open then you probably will

337
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,199
see

338
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,399
two peaks like this but that's what not

339
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,519
what happens

340
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,360
what happens is that these two beams

341
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,680
will interfere with each other and

342
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,959
it could even have these

343
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,760
destructive interference very close to

344
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,040
where the slits are

345
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,839
and you see a dip and in the center

346
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,160
where

347
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,240
they have constructive interference you

348
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,639
will see most electrons

349
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,880
that's really cool that that is a direct

350
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,360
manifestation of

351
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,480
quantum interference and we conducted an

352
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,760
experiment to

353
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,240
discover this whenever you have a qubit

354
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,079
a quantum system while you're doing a

355
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,600
measurement ui

356
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,399
you're actually observing this

357
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,480
interference effect

358
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,360
and measurements are not reversible

359
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,480
like our previous metaphor if

360
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,320
you had a spinning coin you wouldn't

361
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,519
know which

362
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,959
side it would land on and the

363
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,880
measurement is kind of knocking it down

364
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,800
and doing a measurement

365
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,720
once it lands down it will not be able

366
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,800
to reverse back so that's what

367
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,320
happens uh say you have a

368
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,040
quantum system with two qubits and you

369
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,680
have these

370
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,399
four different possible states each of

371
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:52,800
them

372
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,399
has a amplitude

373
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,759
describing them then if you do a

374
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,639
measurement

375
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,440
measure the first qubit and find out

376
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,360
that it is zero

377
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,279
that means it will will be these two

378
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,600
states that's contributing so you kind

379
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,959
of eliminated

380
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,079
these two and you know that the

381
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,079
probability of having the first

382
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,199
cubit to be zero will be the c

383
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,320
0 0 square plus c 0 1 square and

384
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
after this measurement you haven't done

385
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
anything to the second qubit yet

386
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,600
you would then come to a new

387
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,560
quantum state that would be these two

388
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,680
possible

389
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,480
states adding up and you you have to

390
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,240
keep the probability

391
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,560
sum to one that's why there is a square

392
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,920
root of p now

393
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,120
to normalize your system so this is what

394
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,160
happens

395
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,199
after you measure the first cubits

396
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,040
if you then measure the second qubit

397
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,199
then it would

398
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,399
be either zero or one so if your uh out

399
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:58,800
tongue

400
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,040
is zero then it will be this state that

401
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,920
is contributing to your

402
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,679
to your measurement and you will know

403
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,839
the probability will be

404
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,959
calculated from the c00

405
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,160
that's what measurement is and we should

406
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,760
do some exercises we have a very good

407
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,439
exercise already

408
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,160
that makes a quantum random number

409
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,880
generator

410
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,319
so think about the qubits are

411
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,319
actually intrinsically random number

412
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,160
generators because

413
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,880
if you have a qubit with unknown

414
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,400
amplitudes you can do

415
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,760
measurements um and if you have like

416
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,120
a fair coin it can land on either

417
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,559
head or tail so if you have a qubit that

418
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,160
can either come out as zero or one

419
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,120
with uh unknown probability you just

420
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,679
keep

421
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,400
measuring it so every time a random zero

422
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,600
or a one will come out

423
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,280
come out that's a intrinsic

424
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,160
random number generator so we actually

425
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,679
have an exercise on this

426
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,280
on the ms learn microsoft learn website

427
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,039
go there take this class

428
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,320
at your own pace this is a very very

429
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,039
interesting

430
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,400
uh very fun project that also teaches

431
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,120
you how to

432
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,679
set up your computer's environment and

433
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,160
write

434
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,080
q sharp programs using the quantum

435
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,440
development kit so

436
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,840
we will not use our class time to do

437
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,160
this but then this link is here is for

438
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,280
you to

439
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,879
run it on your own

440
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,919
okay so the double slit experiment is

441
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,000
one of the examples one of the

442
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,440
experiments

443
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,080
physicists in the early 1900s

444
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,080
and later did to

445
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,520
discover there's quantum effects

446
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,400
and there are a lot of other experiments

447
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
that people did that really

448
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,760
kind of uh lighten up

449
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,520
the whole physics field that there's

450
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,120
something new that we

451
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,160
didn't know about so

452
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,559
we'll not go through these experiments

453
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,000
but look

454
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,600
them up yourself all these

455
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,080
effects that demonstrated quantization

456
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,360
of energy

457
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,600
and they discovered wave particle

458
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,120
duality

459
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,320
double slit experiment was one of the

460
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,520
the experiments and there were a lot of

461
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,919
other evidence that they gathered

462
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,000
through their experiments that's

463
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,760
what helped physicists realize the

464
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,880
the new fundamental effects that they

465
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
didn't know about

466
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,039
and they also led to the mathematical

467
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:49,840
description

468
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,120
of the quantum mechanical systems

469
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,000
and schrodinger's equation was then

470
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,960
invented or

471
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,640
or derived to explain these effects that

472
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,080
they observed

473
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,799
so schrodinger's equation if you look at

474
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,600
the form here

475
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,280
it looks like a wave equation

476
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,840
it's got this delta

477
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,120
derivative of the

478
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,320
function here and then it's got a time

479
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,600
derivative of the

480
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,559
the same function and this here v here

481
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,240
is just the external potential

482
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,919
sometimes you don't you don't have this

483
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,000
term here but if you just look at the

484
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,960
form

485
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,440
it looks like a wave equation and then

486
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,039
they must have wave solutions as

487
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,960
called wave functions the

488
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,159
derivation led us to know that

489
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,480
the solutions would be a linear

490
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,520
combination

491
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,159
or superposition of all of the possible

492
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,120
wave functions

493
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,600
so very rigorously you can derive this

494
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,559
result out

495
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,360
and that's why in quantum computing

496
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,880
we're using the fact

497
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,320
that you can have two or

498
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,720
if you have one qubit you can have two

499
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,640
different

500
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,919
possible states in superposition

501
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,240
whereas in nature you can have all those

502
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,919
infinite number of

503
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,039
possible wave functions in superposition

504
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,240
so in quantum computing we're basically

505
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,200
just using

506
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,720
two states to be

507
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,840
our units to be our bases

508
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,880
for computation purposes

509
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,919
and dirac comes along

510
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,360
and try to simplify things because

511
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,640
wave function can can be really long and

512
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,679
you can write

513
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,480
these amplitudes in terms of the overlap

514
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,039
between these

515
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,159
this one possible outcome with the

516
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,760
overall

517
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,919
wave function and then that's how you

518
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,760
can calculate what the amplitude would

519
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,320
be

520
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,480
and directs come came up with a simple

521
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,120
notation called direct notation that

522
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,840
would just

523
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,559
be shorthand of these integrals

524
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,480
this is the overlap integral between

525
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,600
this

526
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
one of the solutions with all of the

527
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
solutions

528
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,720
the um that's why we we have been using

529
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,440
this symbol

530
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,840
i didn't really introduce the very

531
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,799
beginning but

532
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,960
now we know i was just using them as

533
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,320
symbols and it didn't

534
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,280
stop you from understanding but now we

535
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,919
know where it

536
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,480
comes from this is a shorthand for wave

537
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,840
functions

538
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,919
this has a name this is called

539
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,200
a kit which is a

540
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,760
second half of the bracket notation so

541
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,240
this

542
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,360
part is called a bra but

543
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,120
what it is is a

544
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,000
complex conjugate of the wave function

545
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,480
so for

546
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
physicists or for people who have

547
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,640
learned physics you have seen this

548
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,960
and this is how you would um do an

549
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
overlap integral

550
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,760
to shorthand this mathematics

551
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,240
and for people who have seen the

552
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,120
hardware

553
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,640
class that i have given i have shown

554
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,720
some parallel comparison

555
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,760
between many many different systems in

556
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,640
our universe

557
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,880
that actually behave very similarly so

558
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,360
people who have seen this

559
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,760
commented last time that this was very

560
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,880
beautiful

561
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,159
so this now today we have

562
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,200
more examples so this is showing the

563
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,440
hamiltonian of all these different

564
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,720
systems pendulum

565
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,240
weight on the spring or lc circuits

566
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,039
this is a superconducting lc circuit

567
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,400
which is used

568
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,520
as a unit for a possible

569
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,640
kind of qubits also experimentally we

570
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,200
also have

571
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,520
nucleus if you look at their energy or

572
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,200
hamiltonian

573
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,480
they are kinetic energy plus

574
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,440
potential energy and they have terms

575
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,080
that

576
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,360
have very very similar mathematical

577
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,039
looks so the

578
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,039
learning physics is basically learning

579
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,679
all these systems

580
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,600
as a model and you will see how similar

581
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,640
different systems are and

582
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,159
the similarity with wave equations

583
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,679
uh what led physicists early

584
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,360
like 100 years ago was they

585
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,000
measured particles and found they looked

586
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,960
like waves and

587
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
microwaves and found they'd look like

588
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,240
particles

589
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,000
and that's why they could write things

590
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,720
in terms of wave equations and which is

591
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,000
um schrodinger's equation and then they

592
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,880
figure out the solution must have our b

593
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,400
wave functions

594
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,440
but before this class we've already been

595
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,240
doing quantum computing we've been doing

596
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,200
gates and vectors and all that we did

597
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,559
not need to use any of these

598
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,919
in a way we are figuring out the best

599
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,279
way to teach people about quantum

600
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,400
computing we

601
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,200
don't even have to go to physics so you

602
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,760
don't have to know a lot about physics

603
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,600
to start working on quantum computing

604
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,440
but it's still very beautiful to show

605
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,640
you that

606
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
they all have physical roots and

607
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,799
if you look at classical waves they have

608
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,279
this

609
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,919
wave equation you can figure out what

610
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:42,720
the

611
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,840
velocity of your propagating wave is

612
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,720
from just by looking at the wave

613
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
equation

614
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,799
so in parallel we have electromagnetic

615
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,520
waves which are light

616
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,080
and electric field and magnetic field

617
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,000
you can also express this and these are

618
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,760
derived from maxwell's equation by the

619
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,799
way yesterday was

620
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,279
maxwell's birthday and these are the

621
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,600
four maxwell equations if you rearrange

622
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,039
them you

623
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,240
get to this wave equations and then you

624
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,600
look at quantum waves

625
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
these are schrodinger equations so they

626
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,919
have very very similar

627
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,919
they're basically all wave equations and

628
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,000
then you you can figure out the wave

629
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,600
velocity and this is how my uh how

630
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,840
einstein got the inspiration when he

631
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,799
looked at the

632
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,440
maxwell's equations matched up into this

633
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,240
wave

634
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,159
form he saw these constants here

635
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,200
permittivity and permeability of

636
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,559
vacuum and their constants and you look

637
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:42,960
at

638
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,000
the classical wave equations

639
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,600
this gives velocity that means these two

640
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,559
constants give you the speed of light in

641
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,679
vacuum

642
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,080
that let him figure out the speed of

643
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,480
light must be a universal constant

644
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,919
and which then also led him to develop

645
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,559
relativity so this is what's really

646
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,679
beautiful

647
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,960
to look at history and how physics

648
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,720
was developed and how

649
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,600
just by looking at dimensions and units

650
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:15,919
and

651
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,320
equations you can realize a lot of

652
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,640
insights about nature

653
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,120
but again you don't need any of this to

654
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,279
do quantum computing but i still like to

655
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,960
show you

656
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,320
this is what you need to know about

657
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
quantum computing is that

658
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,279
amplitudes can be negative or complex

659
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,240
and they can

660
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,640
do distractive interference

661
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
okay so that's what i want to show you

662
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,919
today

663
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,480
we have this survey on microsoft

664
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,440
quantum development kit website and this

665
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,559
is really for

666
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,840
you an opportunity to let us know

667
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,159
what are you looking for why are you

668
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,919
learning quantum computing what

669
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,000
do you want to learn next so that we can

670
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,120
develop official

671
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,159
materials to provide you also some

672
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:04,799
really

673
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,840
fun activities going on uh dr
