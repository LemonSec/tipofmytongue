00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,529
hey folks my name is Matthew ol and I'm

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:05,850
here to talk to you about a course that

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,839
I'm doing together with hackaday

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,460
designed to teach you the fundamentals

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,080
of software versus engineering using

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,870
Deidre I currently work for Cedar Creek

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,849
software as a security researcher and

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,230
also offered training and consultation

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,199
through voiced our security you may have

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,460
seen some of my previous work on

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,859
hackaday and on my github pages where I

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,420
reverse engineer various embedded

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,060
devices and have to explain the concepts

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,310
behind hardly reverse engineering but

15
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,070
enough about me why bother to learn

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,710
about software reverse engineering well

17
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,180
maybe you want to learn more about how a

18
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,370
proprietary binary blob works the you

19
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,469
have source for or you want to start

20
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:41,670
participating and capture-the-flag

21
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,350
competitions and learn more about

22
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,270
information security industries through

23
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,680
solving these kinds of puzzles and

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,960
shadows throughout this course we plan

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,670
to teach you the fundamentals needed to

26
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,500
start your journey with reverse

27
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,230
engineering so forth and after going

28
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,489
through this course we will teach you

29
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,520
the fundamentals of using this tool to

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,320
reverse engineer software with a focus

31
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,729
on x86 Linux executables each session is

32
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,680
going to be focused around practical

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
exercises and have additional exercises

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,729
for you to perform outside of class and

35
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,590
then review later during the office

36
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,670
hours where you'll be able to ask

37
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,920
questions and kind of expand upon the

38
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,420
things you talked about during the class

39
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,090
sessions regarding prerequisites we ask

40
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,860
that you have experience writing C and a

41
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,750
familiar with the concept of assembly

42
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,520
language before the class begins we

43
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,130
provide links to materials to get you up

44
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,479
to speed so that everybody's on the same

45
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,729
page one of the class begins thanks for

46
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,770
watching I look forward to learning and

47
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,430
working

48
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,489
