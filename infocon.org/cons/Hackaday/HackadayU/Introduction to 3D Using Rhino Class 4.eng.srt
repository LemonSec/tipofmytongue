2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,639
hi everyone

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,719
um so we're gonna do

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,759
a grasshopper today which is the kind of

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,039
parametric

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,080
and computational part of rhino and

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,720
it's um there are different ways to kind

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,080
of use it

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,199
which i'm going to try to explain with

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,320
some slides

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,920
so one uh i just thought i'd put it in

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,320
there when i was in london studying

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,600
um i was pretty close um five minute

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,520
walk from the

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,280
british museum and the roof of the

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,440
british museum was designed with

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,360
kind of computational design and they

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,800
they sort of wrote their own

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,079
software to create this uh roof

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,320
uh here it is from above by norman

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,480
foster architects and bureau handhold

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,280
and one sort of antidote sort of i've

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,320
always remembered

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,760
which was um about originality and

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,799
creating your own tools so the the logic

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,920
here was that if

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,240
if you use the tools the off-the-shelf

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,960
tools

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,200
there are only so many things that you

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,000
can do with those

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,840
tools and you end up sort of doing what

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,360
everyone else is doing but when you

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,799
create your own tools which in this case

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,479
they're writing their own software

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,080
they sort of could do things that nobody

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,840
else could do and

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,040
uh grasshopper in a sense uh allows you

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,520
to go beyond the standard components

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,560
of uh 3d modeling and kind of create

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,159
your own if you think of the

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,400
the the file that you create within

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,840
grasshopper as a tool

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
you're kind of writing your own custom

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,200
tool which is sort of your original tool

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,920
um creating certain uniqueness within 3d

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,680
modeling

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,320
so this is an example that you probably

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,840
know already which i'm just going to go

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,720
through

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,079
we could draw a box in 3d exploded and

51
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,520
delete two

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,240
surfaces from the sort of poly surface

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,119
create a

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,600
triangle on the top and a triangle on

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,560
the side

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,840
and then do a sweep two surface using

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
these two as rails these two edges as

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,720
rails and

59
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,959
these two edges as the cross sections

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,000
that

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,959
drawn in rhino would not be adjustable

62
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:15,840
in any way

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,239
we don't like we could scale it which we

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,360
could make

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,440
it is currently permanent and we could

66
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,560
scale it making it

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,239
a permanent change grasshopper

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,879
it will be red if not selected green if

69
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,480
selected i just did the screen capture

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,360
when this was

71
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,640
uh selected but grasshopper will we

72
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,040
kind of organize it in a different way

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,319
and everything

74
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,800
is flexible so we can change the edges

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,160
the width the height

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,040
and the same thing the same model can

77
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,680
then

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
adjust to any sort of settings we give

79
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
it um

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,480
we're gonna do some uh uh surface

81
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,080
uh divisions as well which will be

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,440
and the contour um

83
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,000
which you could then put the number of

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,480
floors

85
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
as a variable and just a slider to

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,360
change the number of floors and

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,360
organize your model differently

88
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,599
so an example of where this would be

89
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,360
useful is if you did

90
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,640
a grasshopper file

91
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,920
for an iphone cover um it would just be

92
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,959
a matter of

93
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,040
adjusting a few variable variables when

94
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,959
the new iphone came out and the

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,519
size was slightly different as opposed

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,360
to starting a new 3d model from scratch

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,879
so you could

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,959
possibly adjust the settings within a

99
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,200
minute flat and then

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,798
you'd be ready to print that model so

101
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,280
a um story which i love from the ted

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,080
talk

103
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,720
trial and error complex by tim hartford

104
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,760
he recalls

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,360
um this story from the 1960s where

106
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,920
um they were struggling with creating

107
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,720
this nozzle for a soap detergent company

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,480
and we're wondering what was the best

109
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,760
designed to do that and the god complex

110
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,879
is sort of

111
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,439
being confident with sort of i'm smart

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,519
i'm intelligent i know what i'm doing

113
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,360
and they created this nozzle and said

114
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,519
this was the good perfect nozzle

115
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,840
and this ex geneticist steve jones came

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,120
along and says no i want to do this

117
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,238
through trial and error

118
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,759
and created ten variations of the

119
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
original uh nozzle

120
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,759
and so one variation was better created

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,520
ten variations of that variation

122
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,759
and kept going until he was 400

123
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,520
variations deep this is

124
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,560
1960s and then had no idea why but this

125
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,360
nozzle

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
just worked better than all the other

127
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,400
nozzles and it's a sort of different way

128
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,560
to think about design and engineering

129
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,639
and grasshopper based on its variation

130
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,400
is a great way to sort of

131
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,320
do a design and create lots and lots of

132
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,600
variation and see

133
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,360
which one's better through trial and

134
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
error

135
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
at a sort of very elite end this is from

136
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,720
our engineers

137
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,240
and if most people when they think about

138
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,160
3d modeling they think about this

139
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,240
this object on the left and this is sort

140
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
of a steel connection

141
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,600
when you leave the variables not up to

142
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,199
something uh

143
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,360
a human might set but as sort of a

144
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,199
computer would just go

145
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,199
plugging in variables and trying to get

146
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,120
to the most lowest amount of steel

147
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
and highest amount of strength that it

148
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,039
sort of gets to this middle object

149
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,479
and then onto this object on the right

150
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,240
which is less steel and does all the

151
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,880
same tasks of the

152
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,759
steel node on the on on the left so it's

153
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,479
it's sort of

154
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,960
producing a lot of variability a lot of

155
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,280
optimization

156
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,840
um kpf i mentioned before is where i

157
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,800
kind of started

158
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,320
my first job and this model was

159
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
in the office when i started and they

160
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,840
kind of produced this facade at the

161
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,639
bottom

162
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,860
which is just um

163
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,680
[Music]

164
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
a lot of skyscrapers want to protect

165
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
pedestrians from the wind

166
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,520
wind basically flows on the edge of a

167
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,199
building and then blows downward

168
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,759
and one way to do that is the new york

169
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,199
wedding cake design

170
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,759
where wind will only go down to the sort

171
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,720
of

172
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,280
tier this is a different way of

173
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,400
producing the skirt

174
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,160
at the bottom of the building and we'll

175
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,000
look at sort of a way to to think about

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,759
doing this kind of skirt design when we

177
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,240
open grasshopper

178
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,319
so um a lot of it is thinking in terms

179
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,280
of lists

180
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,520
and um here's an example that i

181
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,759
i did in python but it's the same logic

182
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
as grasshopper

183
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,800
where if i have four points one two

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,120
or points generally start from zero so

185
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,000
it's zero one two

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,720
three and i offset to create another

187
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,240
zero one two three

188
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,000
and i created surfaces um

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
specifying the points of each of the

190
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,440
triangles so

191
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
this triangle here is going from this

192
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
red one

193
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,560
to this black zero to this red two

194
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,160
and i i put in all these

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,240
uh triangles and surfaces and

196
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,639
then i do some offsets and and uh

197
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,039
do a planar surface between the offsets

198
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,919
creating different window sizes

199
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,919
and just add more options then when i

200
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,680
click a surface and i say apply

201
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,880
this script and do five by five

202
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,840
divisions of

203
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,720
of a lot the lofted surface that we did

204
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
in the loft exercise

205
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
it just automatically creates that

206
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,160
option and when i say do

207
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,120
uh ten by ten i get more divisions and

208
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,160
it calculates

209
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,970
the geometry near instantaneously and

210
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,400
[Music]

211
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,440
it has no limit on on well

212
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
unless it crashes your computer this

213
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,280
last option took about four or five

214
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,720
minutes to calculate

215
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,960
but it's going to do all of those

216
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,160
surfaces

217
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,479
just based on that same logic we started

218
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,199
with

219
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,479
that you have each cell has eight points

220
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,560
and produce triangles or squares

221
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,599
surfaces

222
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,599
uh in that specific range

223
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,160
so there's a sort of zoom in shot and i

224
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,240
also did a random version where

225
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,160
each cell is is done randomly and you

226
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,599
kind of see some interesting variation

227
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,720
happening there

228
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,840
another way to think about

229
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,120
plugging in data into grasshopper

230
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,440
is this is just a gradient here but we

231
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,560
could

232
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,240
take some solar information and

233
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,759
make window openings less or greater

234
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,879
based on that data of of which

235
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,800
facade they're on whether they're south

236
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,559
face

237
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,679
and direct the geometry to respond to

238
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,360
data outside of traditional modeling and

239
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,880
introduce the level of complexity that

240
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,599
would just be too difficult to model

241
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,640
as we've done before in right now so

242
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,600
here's a

243
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,160
example more of something smaller where

244
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,040
a friend of mine

245
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,399
did this cool project and

246
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,760
he produced these uh surfaces which then

247
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,730
were made into

248
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,279
[Music]

249
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,320
uh 3d and had these teeth on them

250
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,080
so they could be laser cut from two

251
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,720
pieces of card and then assembled

252
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,920
together and the teeth

253
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,640
are all custom so as long as you attach

254
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,200
the

255
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,760
teeth together it will produce the

256
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,120
surface that was specified at the

257
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
beginning

258
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,880
so they're sort of assembling these

259
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,760
teeth and

260
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,279
they came together i kind of helped him

261
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,680
assemble that and it just comes together

262
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,120
like that and it's sort of a nice

263
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,959
project which all of those teeth

264
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,000
are parametrically controlled um so it's

265
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,519
writing a computational definition

266
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,560
you specify all the teeth so that when

267
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:38,959
it's

268
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,320
all laser cut it's uh made

269
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,720
perfectly and this was a test model that

270
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,440
he made earlier

271
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,519
so in grasshopper um you type

272
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,399
grasshopper

273
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
enter as in the command bar like we've

274
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,360
done for all the other commands and it

275
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,480
loads up grass

276
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,600
grasshopper um it's sort of a window

277
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
that is separate from the rhino space so

278
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,399
this is our rhino space that is our

279
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,279
our model and then grass offers a

280
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,720
separate interface

281
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,320
where we're going to attach components

282
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,240
and draw strings between the components

283
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,279
where each component is a command that

284
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,079
we've used so

285
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,320
one component might be a circle another

286
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
component might be

287
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,399
divide circle another component might be

288
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,600
put a cone

289
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
on each of the division points and sort

290
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,640
of attach it like that

291
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,839
um if kind of getting really into

292
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,800
a grasshopper it is really nice to have

293
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
dual monitors because it does take up a

294
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,160
lot of screen space

295
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,959
and it's it's a worthwhile investment

296
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,680
so there the files that you create in

297
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,720
grasshopper are

298
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,360
different files when you go to save them

299
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,560
from rhino

300
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,320
so rhino is.3dm and grasshoppers.gh

301
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,360
and you have to kind of

302
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,720
decide what's going to be inside of your

303
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,680
grasshopper mod space and what's going

304
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,959
to be inside of your

305
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,040
i know space so in each when you start

306
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
off you might sort of specify a point or

307
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,920
a curve

308
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,760
and base everything off that point or

309
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
curve if the point

310
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,120
is set to be 0 0 0

311
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,640
the way that i've sort of set most

312
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
things to the origin that can be

313
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,720
specified entirely inside a grasshopper

314
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,680
but if i set it as a point inside of

315
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
rhino and then i move that point

316
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,920
that everything built on top of that

317
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,279
point will move

318
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,680
but when i go to save it it won't save

319
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,320
the point

320
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,360
because the point is in rhino and the

321
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,640
uh grasshopper part is referencing that

322
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,120
point

323
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,800
but that point isn't actually in

324
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,040
grasshopper and i'll show you that

325
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,959
um later so here's an example

326
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,320
i've um created sort of two

327
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
did screen capture of both sides of the

328
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,399
screen and

329
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,560
a point we'll start off create a point

330
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
and specify that point as

331
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,040
zero zero zero and you can see this sort

332
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,920
of red

333
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,200
x which represents a uh

334
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,240
a grasshopper point

335
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,760
everything that we draw on grasshopper

336
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,519
will be it will appear as red

337
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,519
in rhino green when selected

338
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,279
and then i would add a circle kind of

339
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,200
component and each of these components

340
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,519
has

341
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,000
inputs on the left and outputs on the

342
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,959
the right

343
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,120
and left clicking on any one of these

344
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,959
letters will sort of reveal

345
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,279
more information about what each of

346
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,560
those letters stands for

347
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,440
so in this case this is a circle uh and

348
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,760
c

349
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,800
is going to be the center point of that

350
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,360
circle n is going to be the normal

351
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,480
and r is going to be the radius so i

352
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,920
still can't see anything

353
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
even though i set point as the center

354
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,040
point of the circle

355
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,480
i create a slider and um that's

356
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,079
currently set to one so i can't see

357
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,839
anything there

358
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,760
but when i move it up to 100 i start to

359
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
see the the circle

360
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,480
in rhino and i can just swing that

361
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,399
slider to any number i want and that

362
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,440
that circle would

363
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,120
update so then i could create a divide

364
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,920
component

365
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,600
and connect the circle to

366
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,519
the curve to be divided and then put

367
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,959
another slider into the number of

368
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,839
divisions

369
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,800
and you see that sort of the 20

370
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,839
divisions on that circle

371
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,480
and then just copy paste create another

372
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,279
circle but the radius to be 20 on each

373
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,120
of the division points

374
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,680
so that creates 20 new circles all with

375
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
the center points of the division point

376
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,880
on the original

377
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,800
circle and i have a slide of each one

378
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,360
this slider is the radius of the smaller

379
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,760
circles

380
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
and if i do that again i just end up

381
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,079
with a lot of geometry in the model

382
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,079
and it's it's quite easy in grasshopper

383
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,160
to

384
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,160
create a lot of geometry really fast

385
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,040
so i just rather than have multiple

386
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,480
sliders if i wanted

387
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,839
the same number to be controlled back to

388
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,440
kind of like in the rhino model when i

389
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,519
want less points on a nurbs curve to

390
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,639
have control over it

391
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,880
i want less sliders so the division

392
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,199
points i can just use one slider and

393
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,519
sort of plug this slider into both

394
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,959
division points and this slider into

395
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,240
both circles

396
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,360
that's currently set to 20.

397
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,000
and if i change the number of division

398
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,560
points

399
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,880
down to 10 that will reduce the amount

400
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,160
of geometry in the model

401
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
because all of these circles are based

402
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,079
on the number of division points

403
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,599
therefore it's sort of a bit cleaner

404
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,440
and in this case i

405
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,399
sort of reduce the radius of the initial

406
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,360
circle

407
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,720
from 100 to 50 and that just updates

408
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,079
everything because it's

409
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,800
it's still a circle now of radius 50

410
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,680
divided 10

411
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,160
times with new circles created with a

412
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,560
radius of 20.

413
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,720
so the the formula sort of remains in

414
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,800
place

415
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,760
i can uh take any of these components if

416
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,199
there's too much challenge in the model

417
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,079
and either turn the preview off to make

418
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,040
them invisible

419
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,240
which the shortcut is control q um

420
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,920
i'm not a big fan of that shortcut

421
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,760
because if you click that shortcut

422
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
when you're when you've the rhino model

423
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
activated that will

424
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,320
quit the program it will ask you are you

425
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,279
sure

426
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,800
but control q is how you sort of hide

427
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,320
a component you kind of select multiple

428
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,000
components select control

429
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,800
q and hides them if you want to turn

430
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,079
them off

431
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,480
as in they are not no longer affecting

432
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,440
the

433
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,959
the sort of grasshopper definition that

434
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,040
that would be control e which is either

435
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
enable or

436
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,680
um so

437
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,440
all of the grasshopper geometry when

438
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,120
it's in that sort of red

439
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
uh mode it's not clickable

440
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,279
or if you were to to go back into your

441
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,880
rhino model you wouldn't be able to snap

442
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,160
to that geometry

443
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,759
it's sort of still in that sort of

444
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,480
flexible unfrozen geometry

445
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,600
and the the term that is used is

446
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,040
bake to freeze the geometry at that

447
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,160
point in time

448
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,639
and bake it into your rhino model which

449
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,160
you kind of select what components you

450
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,199
want

451
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,079
say bake selected and now that's curves

452
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,040
or surfaces

453
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,320
in the rhino space and after that you

454
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,360
can sort of

455
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,959
leave grasshopper behind or

456
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,079
move it to the side and sort of change

457
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,160
the settings and bake it again

458
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,759
so i uh uploaded um four

459
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,279
or three or four i can remember three

460
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,440
three grasshopper definitions

461
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,759
to the hackaday project page so you can

462
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,720
kind of see them

463
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,320
this is the loft tower um

464
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,839
that i'm not going to draw in

465
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,839
grasshopper that we did previously

466
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,720
but what i've done here is i've created

467
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,600
a circle

468
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,959
on the bottom created a circle

469
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,759
another circle um you can't see that

470
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,559
circle there

471
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,679
so two circles divided them i think

472
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,959
seven times created

473
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,319
a line between uh

474
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,839
each of the seven divisions on both

475
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,839
circles

476
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,359
and then you can move a slider to move

477
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,280
each one of these points along each one

478
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,559
of these lines

479
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,640
and there's a nurbs curve that gets

480
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,599
drawn

481
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,919
on these seven points so the bottom

482
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,840
curve of our lofted tower and the top

483
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,720
curve

484
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,400
are controlled by these seven points

485
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,000
which we have a slider for each one of

486
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,039
those

487
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,720
um points and then it's lofted in

488
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,760
grasshopper

489
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,600
and then divide a contoured in

490
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,039
grasshopper and then

491
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,480
those contours are extruded in

492
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,280
grasshopper so if i move any of these

493
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,200
initial control points

494
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,720
um then the whole model will update

495
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,400
because it's all parametrically

496
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,440
linked i might not get time to go onto

497
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,799
it so i'll just cover it now

498
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,840
that you can add sliders

499
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,880
to a remote and then have that remote in

500
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,960
grasshopper so this is a screen capture

501
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,039
from grasshopper or from rhino without

502
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:09,919
grasshopper

503
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,240
but this remote just has all my sliders

504
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,520
so you can see the top curve

505
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,840
the bottom curve seven different points

506
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,880
change

507
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,240
the numbers for them as well as

508
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,679
changing the floor thickness the floor

509
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,320
to floor height and

510
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
the tower height overall height and you

511
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,600
just move those sliders

512
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,000
and that file is on hackaday so if you

513
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,520
want to um

514
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,360
mess around with that that's uh right

515
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,160
there so i'm going to jump into

516
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,799
uh software now and we're going to do

517
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,039
our first

518
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,360
james i put a link on the chat okay

519
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,600
great

520
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,760
so this is rhino um nothing loaded

521
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,799
uh nothing in the file so if we type

522
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,880
ground stopper

523
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,919
it will load i've already loaded it and

524
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:00,480
i've

525
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,250
nothing in grasshopper so

526
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,960
[Music]

527
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,080
to start i just double click anywhere on

528
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,880
the screen

529
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,960
and a double left side double left click

530
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,720
and it says enter a search word

531
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,400
and that's sort of the command bar in

532
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,720
rhino so if i type point

533
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,480
it will have the list of points you can

534
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,039
of course

535
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,840
go through the menus and find each one

536
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,600
of these components

537
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,880
but um so i set point

538
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,200
so it's currently orange which means

539
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,320
it's it's

540
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,760
unspecified and i would right click

541
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,039
and say set one point which

542
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,559
now if i click set one point it's going

543
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,480
to go back into rhino and you can see

544
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,200
the command

545
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,320
bar it says what is the point location

546
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,600
so if i type zero comma zero comma zero

547
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,799
and press enter that's now specified

548
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,120
and that's got this red x which

549
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,160
says that's a grasshopper point

550
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,039
that's specified um to show you the

551
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,280
difference that if i create a point in

552
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,440
rhino and i double click

553
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,919
to a point again and go set one point

554
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,159
point object to reference if it says

555
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,520
coordinates you need to sort of

556
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,000
change the type here from coordinate to

557
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,120
point

558
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,520
so point object to reference and

559
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,120
reference that point

560
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,200
so in this case the second one i can

561
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,120
select this point and move it in rhino

562
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,240
space

563
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,080
which that point in grasshopper is

564
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,679
moving with the point

565
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,280
where this one is not selectable this

566
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,880
point is just entirely

567
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,360
in grasshopper uh because i've specified

568
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,159
it as zero

569
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,200
zero zero the problem with this just to

570
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,840
repeat what i said earlier

571
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,400
is this point the link between

572
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,520
this component and this point cannot be

573
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,360
saved

574
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,679
you can sort of put a note here and say

575
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,440
specify one point when you open the

576
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,960
model for the first time

577
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,600
and have everything else sort of saved

578
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,240
and then just

579
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,799
go back to the modellings every time

580
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,240
somebody opens it they have to reference

581
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,360
the point

582
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,720
or reference the initial geometry so

583
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,080
i'm going to do um i think the exercise

584
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
i first learned in grasshopper

585
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,159
which we're going to type a rectangular

586
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,400
and pick this one kind of um this would

587
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,919
actually be a rectangle

588
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,400
rectangle three point um but i want this

589
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,480
which is a rectangular grid

590
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,880
um it might be useful to kind of go

591
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,400
through these menus

592
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,760
which if i went through um

593
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,240
vector and then grid there's my

594
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,840
different types of grids that i can

595
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,600
select so i've got the inputs on the

596
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,039
left and the outputs

597
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,480
on the right i can uh sort of left hover

598
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:50,960
over this

599
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,400
and this one's a base plane sx

600
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,840
is the size of the grid cells sy is the

601
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,280
y direction

602
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,520
e x is going to be the extent which is

603
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,919
the number of grid cells i've been there

604
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,679
on the x and the y

605
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,280
so i can just plug in my point

606
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,000
into this one that's fine for a plane

607
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,640
and i can type slider and i want a

608
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,720
number slider

609
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,440
so that the default number slider is

610
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,720
going to load with

611
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,600
a floating point i want to set it to

612
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,200
integers so i always have to sort of

613
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,919
change it to integers and then i also

614
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:32,559
need to

615
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,159
right click and change values and

616
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,159
i don't want a minimum value of zero i

617
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,760
want a minimum value of 1 so there's

618
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,600
always at least one

619
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,039
point and then a maximum value i'm just

620
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,760
going to put as

621
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,679
100. and

622
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,960
one thing i kind of find a little bit

623
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,200
annoying in grasshopper is if i

624
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
click off now that's not saved i have to

625
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,480
click

626
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,840
commit changes for that to

627
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,880
so that's now a slider from 1 to 100.

628
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,000
so i can click

629
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,720
into that one and once i have that

630
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,360
settings

631
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,280
uh done for one time i can just copy

632
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,480
paste

633
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,559
and uh the same settings now it's an

634
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,360
integers

635
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,960
slider from 100. i'm just going to

636
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,640
left click from the end here and drag it

637
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,600
into the rectangular grid component

638
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,679
so now we can see in the sort of

639
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,960
background here

640
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,640
this grid that we've created and

641
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,760
this is the size of

642
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,679
x and y of each grid cell and this is

643
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,559
sorry this one is

644
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,159
this is the number of cells in our

645
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,440
um grid and this is the size of each

646
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,000
grid cell

647
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,120
so i'm planning on being 100 and if i

648
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,000
want to go with

649
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,840
if i want to drag and drag slower i just

650
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,200
hold down control

651
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,919
while dragging it and it drags at a much

652
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,200
slower rate

653
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
which if you're trying to control it is

654
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,520
useful

655
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,520
so and just repeat that this grid is not

656
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,400
clickable or snappable in rhino because

657
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,200
it's entirely

658
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,880
in grasshopper so now i'm going to

659
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
type circle and i've got different

660
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,480
circles that i can create so there's a

661
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,799
different component based on what i want

662
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,480
the inputs to be

663
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,520
so if i want to do a three point

664
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,840
uh circle where i'm going to give it

665
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,200
three points abc

666
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,840
i would do it that way but i'm going to

667
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,240
do

668
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,200
a circle and i want cnr and you kind of

669
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,240
just get used to these

670
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,760
after a while and cnr is um

671
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,840
wants a center point a normal and a

672
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,919
radius

673
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,919
and i can look at the outputs of the

674
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,159
rectangular grid

675
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,799
and i have the cell outlines and i have

676
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,760
the points

677
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,480
and i only really want the points in the

678
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,840
exercise we're going to do

679
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,240
so i connect the points to the circle

680
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,799
and nothing has changed in

681
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,840
my rhino model as of yet and

682
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,039
i'm not going to worry too much about

683
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,000
the normal and i need to set a radius

684
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,520
so i can just copy and paste i use ctrl

685
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,720
c ctrl v

686
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,240
for the slider and i'm going to plug

687
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,840
this guy in here and now i can see

688
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,880
that i have these circles that appear in

689
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,320
let me just double click this

690
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,760
um so now this slider is operational

691
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,919
and you can see all of those circles

692
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:48,880
moving

693
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,559
based on changing this radius and

694
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,039
if i was to change this one that that

695
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,840
would just add

696
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,440
more cells to the grid

697
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,840
so i think

698
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,400
what we're going to do now is we're

699
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,039
going to use

700
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,120
a distance command and i think using

701
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,159
distance in

702
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,360
rhino was really just to check the

703
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
distance of something

704
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,000
um but here we're going to use it

705
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,240
slightly differently so

706
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,960
i want the distance from this point that

707
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,240
we created

708
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,279
which is a point that i can drag and i

709
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,720
want the distance from

710
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,240
this point to the

711
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,000
center points of each of those circles

712
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,600
so on the rectangular so the circle the

713
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,080
c

714
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,640
is the curve geometry that is the actual

715
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,360
circle

716
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,440
but this p over here on the grid is the

717
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,039
center point of that circle

718
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,400
so i want the distance between

719
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,240
that one and this is that point

720
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,480
so

721
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,000
and now if i left click over here i can

722
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,720
see there's

723
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,039
a hundred and if i read that sort of

724
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,000
text

725
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,200
there's 196 locally defined values which

726
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,480
means

727
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,760
that it's got a list of the distance uh

728
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,200
starting with the first one

729
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,559
of every single distance between this

730
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,559
point and all of that information

731
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,480
and if i double click and i type panel

732
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,039
just as an optional step and i right

733
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,240
click

734
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,600
or left click and drag that into the

735
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,440
panel i can see

736
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,840
what information is coming through there

737
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,199
and there's lots of info there

738
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:50,639
so um with this distance i'm going to

739
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,200
put a multiplier which is multiplication

740
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,600
and use another slider

741
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,679
and i want basically to just put a

742
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,880
multiplier

743
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,320
on the distance and i'll show you why i

744
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,919
did that it's like i'm just going to

745
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,080
leave this to get out of the way

746
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,640
and now i'm going to drag this circle up

747
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,840
here

748
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,520
and rather than use this radius to

749
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,919
control the radius of all of these

750
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:18,799
circles

751
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,760
i'm going to use this number

752
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,600
so i can't see anything right now

753
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,120
because

754
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,399
it's either too big or too small and

755
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,840
if i move this slider i can see making

756
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,760
it bigger does nothing but

757
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
there sort of brings the geometry into

758
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,360
focus when it's around

759
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,120
warm so i'm going to firstly change this

760
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,480
to a floating point

761
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,840
so that i can go to less than one

762
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,880
and then change the values on the slider

763
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,000
where the

764
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,039
minimum is zero and the

765
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,039
maximum is one so this is just going to

766
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,679
be

767
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,880
numbers between 0 and 1.

768
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:13,120
and then i can lower down this multiple

769
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,320
and this is sort of creating an

770
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,480
attractor point to control

771
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,840
the radiuses of all of these circles

772
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,559
so then moving this point updates

773
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,039
all of the radiuses in here

774
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,320
so um the grid the rectangular grid

775
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,120
these lines

776
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,159
are still on and to turn them off i can

777
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,640
right click and turn preview manually or

778
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,000
control q

779
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,760
um it's if you select multiple objects

780
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,120
and right click

781
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,840
and click preview it only turns off one

782
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,120
component at a time

783
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,039
so that's why the control q is useful if

784
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,640
you need to do multiple components

785
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,559
control q will turn preview off on all

786
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,360
selected components

787
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,120
and um i'm not going to cover it

788
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,520
because we won't have time but for later

789
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,880
if anyone's interested

790
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,320
if you want to do multiple points

791
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,760
you basically have to multiply the

792
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,000
distance of each

793
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,799
center point to each point by each other

794
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,279
and then this multiplier

795
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,919
needs to be way smaller and you

796
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:26,880
basically

797
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,200
um can have multiple attraction points

798
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,080
within your model

799
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,720
you could also um if you want guys want

800
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,600
to try it out

801
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,320
do a curve and doing the the distance

802
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,200
between

803
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,679
the curve the nearest point uh um

804
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,600
the distance between the curve and the

805
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,200
center point of each of those circles

806
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,080
and then it's an attractor line where

807
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,480
your

808
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,000
um doing the sourcing model but if

809
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
we're going to open my our open rhino

810
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,440
and grasshopper now

811
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,600
and uh everyone can have a chance to try

812
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,679
this out and ask questions

813
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,039
just creating this much geometry

814
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,919
you could also extrude each of those

815
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:06,640
circles

816
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,480
and there's just one extra command

817
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,240
or you just extrude and we'll take one

818
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,120
of these

819
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,159
one to 100 sliders copy paste it

820
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,440
put it into the distance

821
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,200
and oh sorry it needs to be

822
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:33,760
a vector

823
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,720
so i typed um rather than just have a

824
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,200
number

825
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,600
of a vector so i typed a a unit z

826
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,840
vector and now that should

827
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
multiply

828
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,549
[Music]

829
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,880
everyone can start drawing and i'll just

830
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,840
figure out what i did wrong here

831
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,080
and if there are any questions i'll have

832
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:15,840
the chat open

833
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,880
oh sorry the they were extruded i just

834
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,840
couldn't see that in the top view

835
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,840
and i could also connect the uh

836
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,720
rather than use a number connect my

837
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,519
distance this kind of more complicated

838
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,840
list

839
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,519
i'm going to just put in another

840
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,600
multiplier let's

841
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,880
take that number

842
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,600
put that in there

843
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,960
and now the height of each of those

844
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,919
extrusions is based on

845
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:25,840
the attraction point

846
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,360
how do you delete connections between

847
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,720
notes so um just right click

848
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,799
where the connection is uh

849
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,519
on this one fourth down is disconnect

850
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,080
and

851
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,320
uh if you have multiple things connected

852
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,240
um you hold shift

853
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,279
down if you want um if you if you

854
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,120
connect something it replaces it but if

855
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,640
you hold shift down

856
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,799
and then you release the left point that

857
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,240
would add multiple points

858
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,320
so if you right click on them disconnect

859
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,600
and it'll give you a list of all

860
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,039
connections and you can just disconnect

861
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,960
them there

862
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:21,839
hope that answers a bunch of questions

863
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,040
if matter joe want to share your screen

864
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,920
maybe we can just

865
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,680
see how hard this is or i'll answer any

866
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,078
questions

867
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,480
yep oh okay so you're creating uh

868
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,119
so um i'm sure what that was yeah

869
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,119
there's different form there's different

870
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,920
types of um sliders that we can do but

871
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,160
the simplest slider is a number slider

872
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,119
so we're probably better off just uh

873
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,920
just sticking it down

874
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,680
so the the p is going to be a base point

875
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:13,839
or yeah

876
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,510
you can do it the way you've done it

877
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,920
[Music]

878
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,839
i think it just defaulted

879
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,920
i didn't i didn't set one over there at

880
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,599
all it just defaulted there i guess

881
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,839
so set one point is

882
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:55,839
fine it's great

883
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,640
so how do i set that then i pick it over

884
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,680
here

885
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,319
right click

886
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,800
and then see the set one point set

887
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,280
multiple points uh below

888
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,680
okay so then here i would go

889
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,440
so the command bar is asking you for

890
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,960
point location

891
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,839
so i can just type that in right yeah

892
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,839
so probably don't copy paste until you

893
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,800
um so until i set my

894
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,160
extension and uh

895
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,640
you notice how it was red there that's

896
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,200
because

897
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,720
um you can have a floating point

898
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,599
for the size of each of the grid cells

899
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,200
but you can't have a floating point for

900
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,640
the number of cells

901
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,640
okay you can have two 0.2 cells

902
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,680
so that wanted to be

903
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,200
the second the e x and e y wanted to be

904
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,079
integers

905
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,760
okay so it tells you when you have a

906
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,880
clash between

907
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,040
sometimes you can have clashes and you

908
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,640
can tolerate the clashes

909
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,839
but it will go red

910
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,640
and the value is where it starts when

911
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,240
you open it is that what that is

912
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,920
yeah that's its current value but you

913
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,240
can manually change that to whatever you

914
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,839
want

915
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,880
so on your rhino space you're really

916
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,160
zoomed in

917
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,240
but the geometry i think it's there

918
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,359
if you just max maximize your top view

919
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,000
and zoom out

920
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:43,839
yeah there it is

921
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,720
make sure you're in the right window

922
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,160
and one issue is if you have sliders

923
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,760
with really big numbers

924
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,680
and you already have a model with lots

925
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,800
of things going on on it and you move

926
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,079
that slider uh too high such as the

927
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,839
tower i show you with tons and tons of

928
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:04,480
divisions

929
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,520
your computer will just crash it will

930
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,599
attempt to make the calculations you try

931
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,800
to make you get it to do

932
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,960
so that's just that so that's a safety

933
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,319
feature really right

934
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:19,520
set your yeah your limits carefully yeah

935
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,240
so this is so these are the points and

936
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,880
these are

937
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,520
this outlines

938
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,920
so with the circle that would be a

939
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,960
circle that you're going to

940
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,880
right click and set one point to set one

941
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,400
circle we want

942
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,280
a different component which is the cnr

943
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,680
circle

944
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,640
center normal radius

945
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,040
we want to use the points not the cells

946
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,520
so these big oh gosh i'm going to make

947
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,280
all the mistakes here for you james

948
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,960
that's great i mean okay

949
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,520
so that's my center my normal defaults

950
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,079
to

951
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,839
positive on that plane is that what that

952
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,359
is uh normal

953
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,000
in this case is going to just default to

954
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,960
sort of

955
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,160
vertical um we're not going to worry too

956
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,200
much about the normal

957
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,319
right now but um if you if you were to

958
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:24,640
do

959
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,800
let's say a sphere and then um

960
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,880
divide points on a sphere the normal

961
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,240
would be pointing

962
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,760
away from the sphere on every one of

963
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,520
those points and you could create a

964
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,800
circle

965
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,280
um all the circles on the division

966
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,720
points tangential to the

967
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,359
surface of the sphere okay when you're

968
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,359
in 2d it doesn't matter right it all is

969
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,440
in the same plane yeah essentially

970
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,720
we're just going to do this in 2d

971
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,640
because by the same it will be

972
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,160
okay so that's that i need to set

973
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,480
another point too right

974
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,599
yeah and this time we're going to set

975
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,040
the point differently where you create a

976
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,520
point

977
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,079
in rhino and reference it

978
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,839
okay so

979
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,279
and then here i just

980
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,040
it's at one point and i pick that point

981
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,839
so

982
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,839
yeah but you need to just check what

983
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,119
your command

984
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,359
uh says

985
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,920
and make sure that it's selecting a

986
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,680
point another coordinate yeah type point

987
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,160
so that's fine

988
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:59,040
okay so that's my point now

989
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,240
this distance from

990
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
here

991
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,920
i'm just curious how everyone else is

992
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,119
doing is anyone

993
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,040
you're done or is anyone really

994
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,520
struggling

995
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:41,839
and type in the chat

996
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,040
leo says poorly do you have any

997
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,720
questions leo or

998
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:23,839
i'm not going to answer anything

999
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,839
so

1000
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,760
always check the sliders that they save

1001
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,359
the settings because

1002
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,920
it i always click off and it doesn't

1003
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:33,839
change the settings

1004
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:47,839
that becomes my radius

1005
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,040
okay there's two questions um

1006
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:29,839
i'm gonna share my screen again and

1007
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,319
okay so on how do you create a slider

1008
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:44,160
um so in grasshopper um

1009
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,000
so i've got my machine screen shared

1010
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
again for anyone just listening

1011
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,400
um so double click and that's how i kind

1012
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,040
of get the

1013
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,760
uh where i'm going to type commands into

1014
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,160
it says enter a search key

1015
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,200
and i just type slider and it gives me

1016
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,520
a list of sort of matching results and

1017
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,880
it's the number slider

1018
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,800
that i'm after alternatively

1019
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,680
from the parameters menu input and it

1020
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,000
shows

1021
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,480
me all a range of inputs and number

1022
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,040
slider

1023
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,319
is there on the menu bar

1024
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,359
and then right clicking on

1025
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,680
any slider is going to have the slider

1026
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,960
type which is

1027
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,559
how i'm going to change between floating

1028
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,200
points and integers

1029
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,520
which as i said is important for the

1030
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
number of cells in the in the grid

1031
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,880
because i can't have a 2.5 cells

1032
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,760
and then the values i want to change the

1033
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,119
minimum and the maximum

1034
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,839
number and then i have to click commit

1035
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,079
changes for it to actually work

1036
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,480
that the vowel is just its current value

1037
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,400
which i usually move with the slider so

1038
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,680
you don't need to worry about entering

1039
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,160
it here

1040
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,400
um on deleting uh connections

1041
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,839
uh for michael um if i

1042
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,520
right click on any for any component

1043
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,760
and i'm sort of hovering over the the

1044
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,280
inputs

1045
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,640
or the outputs and i right click

1046
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,400
and i get the menu and i have this

1047
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,960
disconnect

1048
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,319
third down in this menu and then i just

1049
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:34,800
left click on that it will disconnect it

1050
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,480
and as for a quick overview

1051
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,800
um

1052
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,960
we're creating a

1053
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,160
point as our initial point then a

1054
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,440
rectangular grid which if you're looking

1055
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,319
for

1056
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,920
things in the menu the rectangular grid

1057
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,520
is under vector

1058
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,920
and types of grid then we're creating

1059
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,040
sliders you can create four sliders if

1060
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,720
you want i just created two

1061
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,240
but um you want to set the

1062
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,079
sliders to integers not to floating

1063
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,480
points and select the limits to

1064
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,079
100 and then left click to drag

1065
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,119
the slider into s of x and sy and

1066
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,119
into e of x and y then we want to create

1067
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:23,440
a

1068
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,359
cnr circle so when we type commands

1069
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,760
circle and don't click the other types

1070
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,880
of the three point circle

1071
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,079
or this um

1072
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,200
circle or any zoom so we need the

1073
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,160
circle c and r which is um

1074
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,920
[Music]

1075
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,040
center point normal radius

1076
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,839
and we want to connect the points of the

1077
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:48,880
grid

1078
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,880
to the circle which creates a circle on

1079
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,640
every grid point

1080
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,599
and uh just to get started we kind of

1081
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,240
copy paste the slider and set the radius

1082
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,319
to the slider number but then we're

1083
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,520
going to create

1084
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,000
a distance component so we double click

1085
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,880
and type distance

1086
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,440
and we can get this one with the ruler

1087
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,599
on it

1088
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,640
and it wants the distance between two uh

1089
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,280
points a and b so we can set the the

1090
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,760
grid

1091
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,440
center point as a and

1092
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,160
b is a point that we're going to set in

1093
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,040
the model where we want to reference a

1094
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,319
an actual uh point

1095
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,599
so we right click set one point and make

1096
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,720
sure

1097
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,319
it's not setting it as a coordinate but

1098
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,839
it's actually selecting the point as an

1099
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,680
object

1100
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,760
and then given these distances as a

1101
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,000
list of numbers are going to be really

1102
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,200
big or

1103
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,319
really small we use a multiplier and a

1104
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,280
slider

1105
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,200
to scale all of those numbers

1106
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,720
proportionately

1107
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,760
and we can control it with this slider

1108
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,839
connecting this list of numbers into

1109
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,880
the circle component connects this list

1110
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,359
of distances and this list of center

1111
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,720
points

1112
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,559
which this list of circles on those

1113
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,800
center points connects the two lists

1114
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,240
together and

1115
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,720
makes what we want and then i've just

1116
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,160
added

1117
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,480
uh an extrusion with a

1118
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,240
z uh z vector with another multiplier at

1119
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,839
another distance but um

1120
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,880
that's not necessarily necessary james

1121
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,040
how did you get the z vector

1122
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,400
uh units unit and then c

1123
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,680
said you'd say and that's basically

1124
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,280
um a component that's by default set to

1125
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,000
one unit in that direction and you just

1126
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,839
set a multiplier to multiply that as you

1127
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:54,240
wish

1128
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,680
but it works i said slider which

1129
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,319
multiplies it

1130
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,800
a lot of grasshopper classes might be

1131
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,839
eight weeks long

1132
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,760
and an entire section would be on

1133
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,880
vectors

1134
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:19,839
so um

1135
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,119
did you finish it matt um

1136
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,599
yeah i'm still working on my extrusion

1137
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,839
yeah

1138
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,520
um you might just jump back into

1139
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,559
uh watching um another

1140
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,079
uh exercise uh and then

1141
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,400
that will be sort of the the conclusion

1142
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,000
of the lecture tonight

1143
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,319
and um you can kind of figure things out

1144
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,119
later and i'll be

1145
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,119
happy to answer questions afterwards or

1146
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,960
anytime you want

1147
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,400
but um so everyone kind of

1148
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,040
stops drawing

1149
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,680
i'm just asking i'm going to do with the

1150
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:14,400
pace for everybody

1151
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,160
so i i just did control a inside of

1152
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,319
grasshopper and

1153
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:22,640
delete so

1154
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,839
uh i'm going to create um

1155
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,680
two nurbs curves the same as i kind of

1156
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,599
did a lofted tower

1157
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,640
and i could if i wanted um

1158
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,480
do what i showed you in the slides and

1159
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,079
create a parametric

1160
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,359
lofted tower but i'm um i'm not too

1161
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,640
interested in that side for this

1162
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,240
exercise so i'm just going to

1163
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,559
create a quick one in rhino and i'm

1164
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,280
going to

1165
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,400
um just do

1166
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,880
a box that's 100 500 i don't care about

1167
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,280
scale

1168
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,839
and

1169
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:11,839
so i'm just going to create any

1170
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,310
so i'm kind of drawing this in

1171
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:27,480
[Music]

1172
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:38,319
rhino just to be faster

1173
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,720
so that's kind of essentially last

1174
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,440
week's or

1175
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,839
whenever we did surfaces exercise so i

1176
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:44,799
just have a

1177
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,839
single surface lofted sort of

1178
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,119
tower if i type

1179
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,079
surface in this way these kind of um

1180
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,680
little tiny components that have no

1181
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,280
inputs and no outputs

1182
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,880
um they're just if you want to bring

1183
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,319
geometry from

1184
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,720
rhino in so we did that with the point

1185
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,680
so i can set one

1186
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,559
surface and that's that and it kind of

1187
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:07,680
clashes because

1188
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,040
um my rhino surface and my grasshopper

1189
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,040
surface are clashing that's the sort of

1190
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,319
red white so i just select my surface

1191
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:19,760
in rhino and just type hide that turns

1192
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,799
it off and now i have

1193
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:24,319
this grasshopper surface and if i

1194
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,119
wanted to really get into that surface i

1195
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:27,920
could

1196
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,760
create a height vector and sliders and

1197
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,920
do things but right now we just want to

1198
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,680
learn how to divide that surface into

1199
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,400
panels

1200
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,920
and then do stuff with the panels

1201
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,400
so um divide surface

1202
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,079
is a command but the problem with

1203
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,290
that for what i want to do is um

1204
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,359
[Music]

1205
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,559
it's not going to number the division

1206
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:01,599
points

1207
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,640
as a list in the way that i want them to

1208
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,200
be

1209
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,559
numbered so i want two commands

1210
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,920
one is going to be called uh

1211
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,839
domain squared

1212
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,839
um

1213
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,200
so one of them is going to be iso trim

1214
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,919
and the other

1215
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:59,839
is

1216
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:13,839
do

1217
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,839
so

1218
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:41,839
i'm just going to load a file

1219
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:09,839
and recreate what i did there

1220
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,160
domain um

1221
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,079
and iso trim

1222
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:30,000
as a surface so using these two commands

1223
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,640
um the first one is divide domain and

1224
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,240
this one is isotrim

1225
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,640
uh it comes up uh with a different name

1226
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,880
here but that's fine

1227
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,520
and i want to take this surface and

1228
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,599
divide that surface

1229
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,319
and also do this isotrim command so i'm

1230
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,720
connecting the surface into

1231
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,839
the base domain here and the base

1232
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:53,599
surface here

1233
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,599
i want two sliders again the way i had

1234
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,599
them before number sliders

1235
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,040
i want to change the uh slider type to

1236
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,160
integers

1237
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,200
and i want to change the

1238
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,598
limits

1239
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,599
to changes and uh i'm just going to keep

1240
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:14,079
u and b

1241
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,240
the same uh i don't really need them to

1242
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,559
be different and

1243
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,839
uh the divided domain

1244
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:26,720
i'm going to use that as the d here so

1245
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,839
that should

1246
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,319
i'm going to select the surface because

1247
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,200
they're currently

1248
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,710
clashing and

1249
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,400
[Music]

1250
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,599
turn off preview because this surface is

1251
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:44,480
creating a surface

1252
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,480
in grasshopper and then this is also

1253
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,079
creating a surface so that's two

1254
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,680
surfaces that's what was clashing and

1255
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,480
i can see my divisions on

1256
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,040
on the thing as i increase this slider i

1257
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,960
just increase the u and v

1258
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,240
which is the iso curves and that's

1259
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,839
my cells here and then

1260
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:11,839
um in grasshopper they use this command

1261
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:12,480
called a b

1262
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,640
rep and a b-rep sounds um

1263
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,640
stands for boundary representation i

1264
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,000
think and

1265
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,640
that's sort of in place of a polysurface

1266
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,079
it's kind of a more complicated

1267
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,160
component that allows a lot more kinds

1268
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,400
of information than just polysurface

1269
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,680
but we're going to use it sort of

1270
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,760
essentially or well

1271
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,520
if we were to use it it's essentially

1272
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,040
going to be the same thing for a lot of

1273
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,559
basic commands so these are

1274
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:44,000
if i was to right click and type

1275
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,920
bake now just to show you what that

1276
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,000
looks like even at this

1277
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,680
scale so now that would create

1278
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:57,280
a whole bunch of separate surfaces

1279
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,359
so if i was to deconstruct

1280
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:05,680
um the b wrap

1281
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,440
and connect the surface to

1282
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,720
each of them that will give me uh

1283
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,880
faces of the b rep so faces of each one

1284
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,960
of those surfaces as a list

1285
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,359
uh edges and uh vertices

1286
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,280
and i'm going to delete this because i

1287
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,520
don't need it

1288
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,640
and um

1289
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,000
so when i'm doing things in rhino and my

1290
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,280
modeling i might

1291
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,119
just select points manually but when i'm

1292
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:36,720
doing them in grasshopper

1293
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,400
i need a way of doing them so more

1294
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,240
computationally so

1295
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,240
everything is in lists and i kind of

1296
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,920
showed you the panel to

1297
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,680
see what's in that list so i want to

1298
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,760
use the command list item which says uh

1299
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,880
the number of the command and each one

1300
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,599
of these

1301
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,520
lists is um four points on each one of

1302
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,720
these cells

1303
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,079
and then firstly the list

1304
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,720
of each one of the kind of cells and

1305
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:07,119
then

1306
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,200
a secondary list of each of the four

1307
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,160
corner points on each one of those cells

1308
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,359
so selecting the vertices if i want to

1309
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,520
create the list item for that

1310
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,799
and i which is the number on the list

1311
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:24,960
and i can basically copy paste

1312
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,400
and make four of these

1313
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:33,039
and then the first item on any of these

1314
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:35,760
lists is always zero

1315
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,880
so set integer to

1316
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,920
one for the second one set it to

1317
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,240
two

1318
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,520
[Music]

1319
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,000
so if i left-click each of them it's

1320
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,599
going to show what

1321
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,880
it's selecting in the model over here um

1322
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,680
so that is basically point zero on each

1323
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,680
on every single cell there

1324
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,359
point one point two point three

1325
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:06,960
and um if i

1326
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,640
turn off the preview for that turn off

1327
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,200
the preview for that and i just have

1328
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,599
the points and i do a

1329
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,119
surface from

1330
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,039
a four-point surface which can be a

1331
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,640
three-point surface if i don't fill out

1332
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,680
the d

1333
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,079
but um so four point surface and i'm

1334
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,680
going to use

1335
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,839
any number of these points so that's

1336
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:34,720
going to be point

1337
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,480
a that's going to be point b that's

1338
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,920
going to be a point c

1339
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,200
and you can see there it's already

1340
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,000
started to construct

1341
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,720
a triangle on every single one of those

1342
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,839
cells that goes

1343
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,400
from those three points and if i was to

1344
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,520
change

1345
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,000
i'm going to put this one into c so it's

1346
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,440
going to change the point

1347
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,880
it's going to draw a different triangle

1348
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,799
and that's sort of how we divide um the

1349
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:01,920
tower

1350
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,880
and um just as one last point for the

1351
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,440
sort of

1352
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,559
advanced method um if i was to offset a

1353
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:12,000
surface

1354
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,200
and i want to go back to this initial

1355
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,359
surface and that's what we're going to

1356
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,200
offset

1357
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,960
that creates a new surface and then i'm

1358
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,480
just going to copy

1359
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,640
and paste this whole actually i don't

1360
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,920
want the last one but just copy and

1361
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,200
paste

1362
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:32,160
the majority of this part above

1363
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,640
and i want to do the offset surface the

1364
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,480
same thing so i just need to change what

1365
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,920
was initially

1366
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,559
the first surface and just replace

1367
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:45,920
that so now this whole command is

1368
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,559
the offset surface and the four points

1369
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,400
and then these four are for the

1370
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,559
initial surface and

1371
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,480
i have two sliders here and two division

1372
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,920
points um

1373
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,160
of each of the surfaces i kind of want

1374
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,599
them to be the same

1375
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,119
so i want to replace the u and v of

1376
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,839
uh both of them to be controlled from

1377
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,200
the same flagger and then just delete

1378
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,240
the slider

1379
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,599
so now this slider is the the uv

1380
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:14,720
division of both

1381
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,319
the surface and the offset surface

1382
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,680
and if i now want to create my

1383
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,960
free points and i'm just going to um

1384
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,760
control q to turn off all those points

1385
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,559
because they're kind of

1386
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,960
in the way and i can turn off this

1387
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,400
offset surface because that's the whole

1388
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,440
surface

1389
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,880
and change um

1390
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,119
of our three-pointed surface and one of

1391
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:43,119
the points to be on our offset surface

1392
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,520
and what happens

1393
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,960
oh actually i know what i've done i've

1394
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,480
no distance on the offset

1395
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,959
so let's just give it a distance

1396
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,839
let's just increase the amount of

1397
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:05,839
geometries

1398
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:18,640
so now we have in this part

1399
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,960
um an inner surface an outer surface

1400
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,680
um we have four points that we could

1401
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,440
choose from on the inner surface four

1402
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,880
points we could choose from on the outer

1403
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:29,599
surface

1404
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,160
and we've just drawn a triangle between

1405
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,079
three points of the eight points and we

1406
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:34,960
can

1407
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,359
pick whatever three points we want and

1408
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:38,160
that's kind of

1409
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,200
the second exercise um let me know in

1410
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,319
the chat i don't know if this is

1411
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:45,039
uh getting too much replace um and then

1412
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,520
if we hadn't created the initial surface

1413
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,160
with a grasshopper we could change the

1414
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:50,720
height

1415
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,079
and um do everything as well so

1416
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,720
we can still control the offset uh and

1417
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,520
make

1418
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,680
that sort of really pointy actually

1419
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,039
looks like a thomas featherweight

1420
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:02,559
project

1421
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,200
but um

1422
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,920
and you can kind of see and

1423
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,760
probably goes without saying that would

1424
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,000
be really hard to do

1425
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,039
without grasshopper um

1426
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,079
all those angles and just

1427
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,640
and then at the end right click whatever

1428
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,119
we want

1429
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,799
and shift if we wanted multiple

1430
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,799
components but right click

1431
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,839
bake and that brings all of those

1432
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,200
surfaces

1433
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,880
into uh but i know and uh

1434
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,720
if you wanted to do something else with

1435
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,319
them like a 3d printer or something

1436
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:41,440
obviously you need to get it out of

1437
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,799
grasshopper and into rhino

1438
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:47,520
so this baked geometry is no longer

1439
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,440
adjustable or flexible

1440
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,880
um the sliders only control unbaked

1441
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,319
geometry so that's kind of uh

1442
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,160
what we wanted to cover what i wanted to

1443
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,130
cover um

1444
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:00,400
[Music]

1445
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,720
i'm going to stay around but now you can

1446
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,319
finish off the first exercise try the

1447
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,079
second exercise

1448
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,880
um let me know again matt's question

1449
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,079
how's the pace

1450
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,280
and any questions

1451
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:20,239
people have
