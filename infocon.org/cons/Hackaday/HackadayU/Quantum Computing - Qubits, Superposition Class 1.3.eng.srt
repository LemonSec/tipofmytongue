2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,240
thanks everyone for joining

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,719
and if you don't want to be recorded you

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,120
can turn off your camera

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,640
so this is our ninth

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,439
hackaday session but also we have

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,160
included

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,279
other communities today joining from

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,840
every location in the world

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,079
so we

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,840
will be showing some new things and also

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,280
cover some of the areas people who have

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
been here have learned before

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,719
so if people don't mind muting

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,360
themselves

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,120
and to give people an idea of the

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,920
classes

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,320
uh it's been ongoing for quite a while

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,520
with hackaday

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,120
and every week i have some comics posted

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,000
on hackaday this is the intro to

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,840
quantum computing project every sunday

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,200
i spend about 30 minutes and now we are

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,000
extending

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
a little bit to an hour to cover

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,799
one concept from theory

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,159
to hardware or programming and we can

28
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,799
leave some time for q a people can also

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,479
feel free to

30
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,880
post their questions or discussions in

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,840
the chat

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,880
during my presentation i may not be able

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,560
to get to it immediately

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,680
but we can look at it once

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
i finish presenting the slides and also

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,920
if we don't have

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,960
time to cover everything we can

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,360
move all the questions to the hackaday

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,560
projects and i can

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,759
i can reply to people online the

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,960
documentation that we've been using is

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,200
based on the microsoft documentation

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,560
on q-sharp language and also we use the

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,759
quantum cutters

45
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,160
as our practice exercise

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,239
and if you are participating in the

47
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,480
discussion in the chats if you know the

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,360
answers to

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,440
some people's questions please feel free

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,959
to jump in

51
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,520
and write in the chat and feel free to

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,080
discuss

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
as a community so welcome and welcome

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,840
back

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,040
to people who have been coming we

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,599
are having several communities drawing

57
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,599
from hackaday from microsoft

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,120
reactor from the microsoft startups

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,400
we also have them for maker media group

60
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,760
probably joining from there wherever you

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,200
are in the world i hope you

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,319
are safe and i'm really glad to see that

63
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,360
this intellectual subject is bringing

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
people

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,720
from all over the world together

66
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,560
just a little bit about myself some

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,800
background that

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,080
i am a physicist and i started

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,599
my professional study in university of

70
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,239
cambridge and i did condensed matter

71
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,080
physics and worked in the labs

72
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,840
on low temperature physics and

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,959
optoelectronics built a lot of

74
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,080
equipment and did experiments on

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,360
the fundamental properties of materials

76
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,560
so studying

77
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,360
quantum matters and then i went to

78
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,959
harvard for my phd

79
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,920
working on plasmonic circuits went to

80
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,120
the clean room and

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,720
fabricated chip structures designed

82
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,760
them and did a whole

83
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,080
kind of inventing the the chip

84
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,599
structures from scratch

85
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,640
to producing them and doing experiments

86
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,599
on them

87
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,519
and then i went to intel to work on

88
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,360
silicon photonics

89
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,280
which is the interconnect

90
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,400
that you need in data centers between

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,480
optical fibers and servers

92
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,680
and i also worked on those maker

93
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,879
projects and hardware and

94
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,159
did ux design and

95
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,319
did a lot of wearable projects so that

96
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,399
was really fun

97
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,680
and then i went to microsoft as a

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,800
manager of the garage innovation program

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,360
um so there i was able to pursue some of

100
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,080
the

101
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,320
intersections between science

102
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,919
engineering design art

103
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,560
and also supporting our employees to

104
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
pursue their

105
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,080
areas of interest and that's

106
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,040
when i then started going back to

107
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,720
quantum

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
physics where so it's always been

109
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,600
quantum physics but really that's

110
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,360
started looking at quantum computing

111
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,120
when i was in the garage

112
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,080
and even though i had a phd in physics

113
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,360
it

114
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,919
didn't mean that i knew much about

115
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,040
quantum computing

116
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
so that was a really interesting area

117
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,479
for me i started

118
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,680
learning about it myself and then i

119
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,280
started teaching our employees

120
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,560
just learn with everyone and um

121
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,520
learn from our experts uh and then i

122
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,160
joined

123
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,280
the um sorry in between actually

124
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,720
i also have a fashion brand that i do

125
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,759
wearables and fashion design with

126
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,360
science combination between science and

127
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,840
art

128
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,880
as the theme now i'm

129
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,440
with the quantum computing team

130
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,720
officially at microsoft

131
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,479
where i support the education and lead

132
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,759
the education effort

133
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,800
globally and given

134
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,919
people the materials producing

135
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,360
education content to support

136
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,800
our customers and hobbyists

137
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,160
and students anyone who needs to

138
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,479
learn about quantum computing with the

139
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,160
appropriate content

140
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,199
so this classes is

141
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,560
kind of my personal effort to also drive

142
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,680
the community

143
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,319
providing the fundamental

144
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,080
scientific literacy on this subject uh

145
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,400
some

146
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
there are some of the global goals that

147
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
i'm personally interested in

148
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,759
pursuing beside my day job so

149
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,120
giving quality education and helping

150
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,319
people understand

151
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,120
what quantum computing really is is one

152
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,840
of my goals

153
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,120
so at work i produce these learning

154
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
materials

155
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,840
i manage the microsoft documentation

156
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,280
and also produce these learning

157
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,560
paths for people coming from different

158
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,680
backgrounds

159
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,400
recently we launched these two microsoft

160
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,919
learn modules

161
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,560
one is to help you get started with

162
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,720
coding with q sharp

163
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,360
using the quantum development kit and

164
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,759
also

165
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,160
a module on solving optimization

166
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
problems using quantum inspire

167
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
optimization so check those

168
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,120
two out and especially when we get to

169
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,720
the coding part

170
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,160
the the first module would be very

171
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
directly relevant

172
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,599
this project with starting quantum

173
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,599
computing through comics is

174
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,280
kind of my personal interests

175
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,800
when i started just when we started

176
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,160
working from home

177
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,560
and i thought that i wanted to

178
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,680
improve my own understanding of

179
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,240
all the quantum subjects quantum

180
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,120
computing

181
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,720
areas and also be able to

182
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,400
use a accessible way to communicate to

183
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,960
people

184
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,919
because i like drawing i it just

185
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,039
naturally came to

186
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,280
to me i wanted to use comics to teach

187
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,400
um ever since i started teaching and uh

188
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,120
it's been really well received by the

189
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,400
communities

190
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,520
and i i would like to do

191
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,800
is also to show people what is

192
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,759
really uh quantum computing and what

193
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,680
does it involve

194
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,120
beyond a lot of the basics

195
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,479
that media talks about and we need to

196
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,840
get to the level that

197
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,760
we need to have a understanding of

198
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,200
the basis that quantum computing

199
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,120
is using from quantum mechanics

200
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,360
namely superposition interference and

201
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,880
entanglement

202
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,279
uh so those are the the three

203
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,760
theoretical topics that we need to have

204
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,000
a good grasp on

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,040
then there's how do you

206
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,279
use it for programming and that relies

207
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,160
on linear

208
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,200
algebra however we don't have to be

209
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,480
an expert in linear algebra

210
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,959
it just requires us to do a little bit

211
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,640
of maths

212
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,000
and then you will be able to program

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,040
in algorithms

214
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,080
and eventually you would need to write

215
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,440
programs that would run

216
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,399
on actual quantum hardware and that's

217
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,600
what i think

218
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,040
can be taught

219
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,120
through coding and also having hands-on

220
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,279
practices to connect all of these areas

221
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,440
together

222
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,480
um one tip i will give people about

223
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,519
getting to learn quantum

224
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,560
on your own identifying what is

225
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,760
a good source there are a lot of

226
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,440
really great content online but there

227
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,680
are also a lot of

228
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,800
i i sat here via this

229
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,200
can someone who's speaking mute

230
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,720
themselves

231
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,720
thanks so

232
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,160
if you see materials

233
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,839
that talks beyond these superposition

234
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,040
and entanglement

235
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,079
and start giving you ideas of

236
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,480
algorithms those tend to be good

237
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,680
materials that they

238
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,959
they are developed and they move forward

239
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,480
those materials that only is

240
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,920
staying at explaining incorrectly

241
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,519
what superposition and entanglements are

242
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,560
those tend not to be worth reading

243
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
so that's a tip i would like to give

244
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,880
people and most of these materials don't

245
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
even explain what

246
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,760
what interference is so we're gonna

247
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,519
we're gonna talk about all of these and

248
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,519
debunk some of the misunderstandings

249
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,800
that's commonly

250
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,839
spread in media um

251
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,920
so people who have been coming to this

252
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,839
class have already seen these

253
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,880
algorithms the they have learned about

254
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,160
quantum articles

255
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,880
deutsche algorithms deutsch hoser

256
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,079
algorithm

257
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,120
and grouper's algorithm

258
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,800
i would also like to show a lot more

259
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,160
beyond those

260
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,040
uh there are there's source algorithm

261
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,240
there are

262
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,200
chemistry simulations there's quantum

263
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,440
machine learning which is a super hyped

264
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,880
area as well

265
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,000
um there's also what is

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,120
quantum inspire optimization and also

267
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
how do we program a hardware that

268
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,680
possess

269
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,160
what we eventually will get to is

270
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,120
understanding

271
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,760
how quantum computing works um we can

272
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,000
run them on simulators but we will also

273
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
eventually use quantum computers and

274
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,480
hardware

275
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,600
to do the programming and if you are

276
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,320
expert in any of the sub fields in

277
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,959
quantum

278
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,360
computing let me know and we would love

279
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,560
to have you give

280
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,000
a guest lecture if you are doing

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,519
quantum computing already full time

282
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,800
so in terms of understanding

283
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,760
especially for physics related subjects

284
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,639
quantum computing is one of course

285
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,760
i think there is a trinity for learning

286
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,720
and understanding we need to be able to

287
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,680
describe

288
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,279
things with words and we need to be able

289
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,279
to

290
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,279
use equations to

291
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,040
describe the system you need to be able

292
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,600
to

293
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,160
use pictures to condense the words

294
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,480
and all these three you can overlap and

295
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,320
they can replace each other

296
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,440
interchangeably when we get to that

297
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,000
point

298
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,399
that is how we can reach real

299
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,720
understanding we have to be able to

300
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,760
translate between these areas and that's

301
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,480
what i try to show in the classes to use

302
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,240
more

303
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,600
words and drawings to describe them and

304
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,880
i have avoided showing too

305
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,240
many equations

306
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,720
to make it more accessible but we can

307
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,200
use coding to give people some

308
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,560
hands-on practice that would also

309
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,040
enhance with our math understanding

310
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,519
so for today's class we're gonna start

311
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,079
from

312
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,639
superposition but we're not just gonna

313
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,360
stay there

314
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,240
we actually going to take this uh i i

315
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,040
drew this

316
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,800
from mountain to mountain uh these

317
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,519
cable cars that's labeled as q-sharp

318
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,240
which is

319
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,079
a quantum language that microsoft

320
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,040
invented we're going to use that as our

321
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,600
tool

322
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,800
to go from a fundamental concept

323
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,880
to a practical area how do we

324
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,079
manipulate our system to

325
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,720
writing some very very simple algorithms

326
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,839
it will get much deeper but today we're

327
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,240
gonna

328
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,920
just do an introduction and do something

329
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,120
very straightforward but explain what

330
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,720
superposition means

331
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,680
first and we will also explain the other

332
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,320
concepts

333
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,839
in future classes

334
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,639
a step back is to see the importance

335
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,160
of computing everyone knows that

336
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,760
all of our world things and people are

337
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,639
connected

338
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,399
with eli tron electronics and

339
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,839
computers with data centers we cannot

340
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,240
live

341
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,000
without computers anymore

342
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,279
we run a lot of very hardcore tests on

343
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,720
supercomputers

344
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,680
however there are still areas that our

345
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,000
most powerful supercomputers can still

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,639
run into fundamental limitations

347
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,360
things like chemistry simulations and

348
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,240
material

349
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,040
discovery those are fundamentally

350
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,279
quantum mechanical interactions

351
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,399
in those materials we

352
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,560
cannot go beyond a certain

353
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,240
complexity of the quantum mechanical

354
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,440
interactions

355
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,639
uh using our current

356
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,680
computing methods and there are

357
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,519
areas that's um

358
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,519
like signal processing logistics

359
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,560
cryptography information security those

360
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,680
are algorithms and

361
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,600
methods that we came up with they are

362
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,759
not fundamentally

363
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,440
quantum mechanical but we can use

364
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,320
quantum methods to get more efficient

365
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
applications in these areas so quantum

366
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,079
computing

367
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,160
holds a lot of potential to solve

368
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,399
problems that our current quantum

369
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,360
computers

370
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,519
cannot solve it doesn't mean that

371
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,639
quantum computers

372
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,399
are better for everything than classical

373
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,360
computers

374
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,639
they're very specific for specific tasks

375
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,600
that are suitable

376
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,440
for quantum algorithms and

377
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,600
really quantum computing is like

378
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,839
biomimicking

379
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,639
is like a lot of the other inventions

380
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,199
that we

381
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,399
we have as humans is learning from

382
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,040
nature

383
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,839
and implementing that in engineering

384
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,519
quantum computing is the same

385
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,880
we uh learning from

386
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,399
how fundamentally our

387
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,440
matters work the

388
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,279
the smallest molecules and

389
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,920
fundamental particles like electrons

390
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,720
photons

391
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,600
how do they interact and how can we use

392
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,880
their behaviors

393
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,519
in computing that is what this

394
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,480
field is about

395
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,559
so our current

396
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,359
electronics are based on transistors

397
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:09,919
which

398
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,439
use the zeros and ones

399
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,880
as the the information bits

400
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,319
and they are basically like

401
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,599
small switches and these are binary

402
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,720
systems

403
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,760
um we have we can have all kinds of

404
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,039
counting systems we can

405
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,240
use number 10 we can use 12 there's not

406
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,240
really a restriction on what we can use

407
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,360
to count information but then we

408
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,720
resolve down to binary and all of our

409
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,080
electronics is based on

410
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,679
zeros and ones so classical bits

411
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,120
is like a very simple

412
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,960
setup where you can describe your system

413
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,240
as a switch that goes on or off

414
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,120
so you can label that as 0 1 or

415
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,039
temperature being too high or too low

416
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,080
you can also

417
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,120
make it binary or if you flip a coin you

418
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,080
can have

419
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,120
a hat or tail so those can

420
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,320
all be analogies of

421
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,360
binary systems mathematically you can

422
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,720
just describe them

423
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,400
using these vectors those are our bases

424
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
for zero and one and

425
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,559
if you look at this uh it only has two

426
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,720
numbers and that's the only

427
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,799
options that we have if we have only

428
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,080
zero and one so

429
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,320
if you use vectors to describe

430
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,600
zero will be one zero and one will be

431
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,159
zero one

432
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,679
now if you have multiple bits we're

433
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,080
still

434
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,280
talking about classical bits you can

435
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,640
combine them

436
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,679
um using this tensor

437
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,520
product or chronicle product uh

438
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,080
given how you can do how you define it

439
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,840
you can define it to lay out

440
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,840
this way um if you have two

441
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,360
bits you won't be have four options

442
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,760
because you will have zero zero zero one

443
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,360
one zero and one one

444
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,400
and you can describe them as these um

445
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,760
tensor products of two independent

446
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,120
bits these are just two vectors

447
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,840
and then you will obtain a four by one

448
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,880
vector

449
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,640
for each combination so in total you

450
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,919
have these four options and you think

451
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,360
about it yeah that's

452
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,240
what it makes sense if you have four

453
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,760
options

454
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,360
then you would have these four by one

455
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,160
vectors

456
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,720
each with one unit and the the rest will

457
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,520
be zero

458
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,840
and they are in this order

459
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,000
mathematically you can calculate

460
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
what the tensor product is so

461
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,679
i would recommend people take notes

462
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,000
during the class as well

463
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
we're going to show some of the the ways

464
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,840
that we

465
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,520
calculate um so a tensor product is

466
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,640
nothing but

467
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,000
just trying to represent

468
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
two bits together

469
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,360
and is just the first element

470
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,840
times the whole vector and the second

471
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,919
element times the whole vector and then

472
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,120
each timing inch so you'll get all these

473
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,799
combinations up

474
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,919
if you have multiple bits you can

475
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,799
keep doing the tensor products and

476
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,039
writing really long vectors

477
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,480
so say if you have a 4 in binary

478
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,840
you would represent it with 1 0

479
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,799
0 so then you would do a tensor product

480
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,200
of

481
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,720
these three bits then

482
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,320
this is how you would represent a 4 in

483
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,360
a vector we're still talking about

484
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,880
classical bits

485
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,720
and to implement that in hardware we use

486
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,919
transistors that is basically

487
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,960
a sandwich of semiconductors with

488
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,919
metal gates and insulators you can form

489
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,480
these

490
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,520
regions that's filled with electrons

491
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,720
mostly positive or negative charges

492
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,080
and then if there's

493
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,440
electricity from source to drain

494
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
you can control that with the gate how

495
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,880
much electricity you want that

496
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,960
electrical current to flow

497
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,520
if there is electricity then you can

498
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,159
call it

499
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,960
on so that's a one if there's no

500
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,200
electricity you can call it zero

501
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,480
to to be your off state

502
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,760
so transistors are tiny tiny switches

503
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,480
that we put

504
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,960
in our chips in the computers that's how

505
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,880
we implement classical

506
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,919
bits but this is kind of

507
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,799
fictitious and deliberately artificial

508
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,080
nature doesn't behave this way

509
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,360
nature is made of matters like

510
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,720
atoms electrons photons they have

511
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
discrete energy

512
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,640
levels and they can um

513
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,760
have all these levels all be in a

514
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,960
superposition

515
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,559
and i will explain what that is

516
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,000
and these discrete energy states

517
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,240
are the quantity so that each energy

518
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,640
level can be described as a quant that's

519
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,799
why we're calling this quantum computing

520
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,080
because we're

521
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,559
utilizing the quanta how

522
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,679
nature intrinsically behaves and we are

523
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,360
imitating that in computation

524
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,640
so what we need to have

525
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,520
is any system that can give us some

526
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,720
superposition

527
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,200
of different energy levels or different

528
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,039
states

529
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,880
how would that work and

530
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,919
what is really a quantum bit

531
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,120
um so classically say

532
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,760
you can use any binary to define your

533
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,280
classical bits if you say have a circle

534
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,400
that is empty you can call it zero if

535
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,640
it's filled you can call it one

536
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,919
but then in the quantum system

537
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,120
you could have them in superposition

538
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,080
which means

539
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,480
you can have one circle but then you

540
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,360
have a

541
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,480
probability of having a field and

542
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,520
another probability of having to empty

543
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,039
then you see okay i in this case have

544
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,799
one third of zero and two thirds of one

545
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,240
you can use some other analogy like

546
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,360
a lottery bowl

547
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,799
that has 20 beats you can say if they're

548
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,760
all red you can

549
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,720
have zero if they're all blue that's a

550
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,600
one

551
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,120
but if you have a mix you can have

552
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,880
eight over 20 chance of getting zero and

553
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,600
12

554
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,799
out of 20 being one

555
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,120
using a coin you can say a head is a

556
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,559
zero a tail is one

557
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,600
you can just arbitrarily label them you

558
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,880
if it's even coin

559
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
you will get fifty percent chance of

560
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,799
landing on zero and fifty percent chance

561
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,240
of landing on one

562
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,520
that is what a qubit does it is

563
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,640
given a linear combination of

564
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,640
all the pop possibilities each

565
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,640
possibility has a certain

566
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,240
chance certain probability labeled

567
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,760
so that that is superposition is

568
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,480
you may have heard very often in the

569
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,200
media

570
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
the superposition is zero and one at the

571
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,640
same time

572
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
what does that really mean it doesn't

573
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,919
explain anything and what's

574
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,120
timing here there's no uh parameter

575
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,919
called time

576
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,279
that's a really wrong description so

577
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,960
if you hear them say that that's just

578
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,600
take it as a grain of salt and you can

579
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,000
stop watching them

580
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,279
so mathematically um how you can

581
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,080
represent that

582
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,760
is also using a vector this is

583
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,200
any arbitrary label of phi

584
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
you can say this is a quantum state and

585
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,720
it's described by a vector

586
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,240
but now instead of just 0 and 1 you can

587
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,360
have any arbitrary number to give a

588
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,000
weight

589
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,600
to these zero and one possible

590
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,279
states so a is the

591
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,919
amplitude of state zero and b is the

592
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,960
amplitude of

593
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,880
state 1. the probability

594
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,720
of the whole system

595
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,520
of b in 0 is given by these amplitudes

596
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,600
a 4 0 and a squared is the probability

597
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,880
of the state being

598
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,200
in 0 b squared is the probability of the

599
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,799
state being 1

600
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,840
and those two are all both possible

601
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,320
outcomes possible states that this

602
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,919
quantum system your qubit can be in

603
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,799
and a and b can be any number these are

604
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,679
amplitudes

605
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,320
they can be positive can be negative or

606
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,360
they can be

607
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,720
complex numbers and this is very

608
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,919
significant

609
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,159
later on uh when we talk about

610
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,840
interference

611
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,520
that becomes very useful so for now

612
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,559
you will just see that okay a and b are

613
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,200
two

614
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,880
amplitudes and all we need to make sure

615
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,559
is that their probability adding up

616
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,919
will be one this makes sense like in any

617
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,120
system

618
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,840
is our daily life anything's probability

619
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,880
cannot be

620
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,640
larger than one so the amplitude

621
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,000
squared is the probability the sum of

622
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,480
them

623
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,320
will be one so in our early example

624
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,360
our circle will have a square

625
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,480
of one over three and a b square of

626
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,320
two thirds similar with the beads

627
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,440
you can get the probabilities of

628
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,120
these two possible

629
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,678
outcomes

630
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,120
if you have multiple qubits say you have

631
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,080
two qubits you do the same thing like

632
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,360
classically doing a tensor product

633
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,480
you just have these arbitrary amplitudes

634
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,600
in front of them

635
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,279
and you will get these four by one

636
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,120
vectors again

637
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,799
so each is

638
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,080
a amplitude of these four

639
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,279
possible states

640
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,320
uh so remember our earlier introduction

641
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,679
of the zero zero zero one one zero and

642
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,520
one one we have zero zero being

643
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,960
one zero zero zero so that's this one

644
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,440
here

645
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,039
so that the other three elements were

646
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,480
all zero but you have

647
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,559
this ac left so you can label them

648
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,919
like these superposition of the four

649
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,919
possible states

650
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,120
again you don't have any restrictions on

651
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,760
the sign

652
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,960
or the whether they're real numbers or

653
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
complex numbers

654
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,279
you just need to make sure that they add

655
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,320
up to one

656
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,240
the the probabilities

657
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,799
so looking at the difference between

658
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,200
classical bits and qubits again

659
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,480
mathematically you can write

660
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,159
a classical bit as serum one and

661
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,039
qubit is just a linear combination of

662
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:07,919
the two

663
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,120
problem possible states each with

664
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,080
a amplitude associated with them and the

665
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,279
amplitude

666
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,279
square is the probability

667
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,320
then what does this lead to

668
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,200
if you have a cubit you know you have

669
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,279
these two possible

670
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,799
configurations if you have two qubits

671
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,320
you have four possible combinations

672
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,159
um if you have three qubits

673
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,240
then you you can write out all of these

674
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,799
problem possible

675
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,360
combinations and you see that that's

676
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,240
eight

677
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,679
of them so n qubits will give you

678
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,960
two to the n possible configurations

679
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,240
in superposition that's what's really

680
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,039
cool about

681
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,799
qubits is that

682
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,640
the number of possible configurations

683
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,520
is exponentially grows exponentially

684
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,240
with

685
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,440
your number of qubits and it doesn't

686
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:11,919
just

687
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,039
grow as 2 to the n the the possible

688
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,880
combinations of amplitudes is

689
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,080
infinite we already mentioned that they

690
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,159
can be any number as long as you

691
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,200
guarantee that

692
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,640
the probability sum you go to one so

693
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,960
your state you can describe all these

694
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,840
sum these

695
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,640
superposition or linear combination of

696
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,360
the

697
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,399
possible states into a sum

698
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,919
of each possible state and these

699
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,360
amplitudes here can be positive number

700
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,399
one one or two one or three

701
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,799
they could be negative just put negative

702
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,559
on them because it doesn't matter when

703
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,480
this squared is positive

704
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,000
and probability is positive and they can

705
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,720
be imaginary so you can put an i

706
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,039
in them so in general they can be

707
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,320
complex

708
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,559
we will talk about the consequence next

709
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,840
time

710
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,440
so we have very quickly

711
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,720
covered what superposition really

712
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,080
means and now you have a qubit

713
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,440
how is it going to be used

714
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,240
we need to be able to manipulate it and

715
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,279
how do we do that

716
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,399
is to use linear algebra and that name

717
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,039
made me

718
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,559
sound too heavy but is nothing but

719
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,120
some matrices that could be applied

720
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,519
to vectors to change your vectors

721
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,720
so remember we have these

722
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,159
states that is a vector and you have

723
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,440
some amplitudes

724
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,640
associated with them there

725
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,360
is a very commonly used gate called the

726
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,679
h

727
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,840
gate or how to market it has

728
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,720
this kind of form

729
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,880
what it does is

730
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,919
applying these four elements

731
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,360
onto the vector so is a

732
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,640
two by two matrix

733
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,399
is to change a

734
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,000
at first you can say at first it's

735
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,080
classical but then you apply

736
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,679
a harmonic gate or h-gate to them

737
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,559
it will become a superposition will

738
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,080
become a combination

739
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,200
of zero and one if you start with zero

740
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,480
that's

741
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,399
the special casing in a qubit

742
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,840
which is the same as a classical bit

743
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,120
you get this into a superposition state

744
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,080
that also has a one in it if you start

745
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,799
with one

746
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,919
you do a hard one gate you will also get

747
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,399
a superposition between 0 and 1 but this

748
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,399
time with the negative sign

749
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,760
so that's why is almost

750
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,679
all of the elements could be the same

751
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,200
except this last

752
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,919
minus sign here which is very important

753
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,120
because it makes

754
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,240
make sure that when you get these plus

755
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,080
and minus states

756
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,279
you can do another application on these

757
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,880
plus and minus to return to zero and one

758
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,799
if you don't have this minus sign here

759
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,559
you wouldn't be able to return

760
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,240
and distinguish your your states

761
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,919
you can imagine that is

762
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,080
because it's a vector here you could

763
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,279
represent

764
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,640
your vectors in a three

765
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,000
dimensional space um using a

766
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,799
sphere this sphere actually has a name

767
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,200
called

768
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,799
block sphere but don't worry about it

769
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,559
for now because we're gonna talk

770
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,080
a lot more next time

771
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,840
you could label your zero and one as

772
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,240
these

773
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,159
polar positions on these on this sphere

774
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,360
and what this hadamard gate does is to

775
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,520
put your original state into this

776
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,839
perpendicular locations that are

777
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,960
in between 0 and 1.

778
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,839
so the plus and minus states are just

779
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:26,079
superpositions of zero and one with an

780
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:26,960
equal

781
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,839
amplitude so it's right in between the

782
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,280
two

783
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,839
that's what harma gate does and there

784
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:34,480
are other

785
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,679
commonly used gates we would talk a lot

786
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,760
more about gates

787
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,960
but i need i would like to show you some

788
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,159
very simple ones first there is

789
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,119
a another set of gates that's called

790
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,320
polygates

791
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,159
you don't have to pay too much attention

792
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,480
to the to the sphere yet because

793
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,200
i will explain them more in detail you

794
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,920
can just look at the form of this two by

795
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,160
two matrix x gate

796
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,119
does nothing but to flip the positions

797
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,880
of these amplitudes

798
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,920
so you if you start with zero the x gate

799
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,440
will make it a one

800
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,240
if you start with one x gate will make

801
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,800
it

802
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,520
zero so it basically does a flip is i

803
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
think in classical computing you also

804
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,079
have this

805
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,440
flip gates and

806
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,800
you can also have a y that's just

807
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,560
very similar by adding some faces to it

808
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,599
there's also a z gate that is almost

809
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,200
a identity matrix

810
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,599
which does nothing to your system but

811
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,480
then

812
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,280
the z gate has minus sign here so it

813
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,839
adds

814
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,560
a minus sign to your seconds element

815
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,240
so these are some of

816
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,839
very commonly used gates

817
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,320
and if you want to look at the sphere

818
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,960
a z gate is basically rotating your

819
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,079
vector around the z

820
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,760
axis and x gate is rotating around the x

821
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,880
axis

822
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,520
the the y gate is actually a combination

823
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,240
of x

824
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,960
and z so you actually just need the x

825
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,359
and z

826
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,160
you don't need the y y k but i'm i will

827
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,200
show you more about

828
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,280
the block sphere next time don't worry

829
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,760
about it

830
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,359
so we have learned a little bit about

831
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,880
how to change your

832
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,079
quantum bit and we learned

833
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,200
what superposition means and now we can

834
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,560
we can go fast forward to do some coding

835
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,000
to see how

836
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,359
things will behave
