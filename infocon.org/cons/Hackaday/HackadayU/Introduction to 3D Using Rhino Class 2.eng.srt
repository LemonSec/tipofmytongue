00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,800
hi everyone so

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,759
um i'm going to um just follow up with

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,240
some of the questions from last week

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,400
while we wait for more people to come in

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,440
uh i checked

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,600
the elevator click on mac which is this

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,039
sort of control click lock into the

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,240
vertical axis

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,480
it's just command click um hopefully

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,599
that works i didn't

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,039
get to check it out online because i

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,800
don't have one um

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,279
another way to move a layer which was

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,399
discussed last week

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,760
i kind of went through how to do it

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
manually but you can just type move

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,040
layer as a command and then

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,160
ask what um what layer you want to move

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,879
it to

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,480
and then you can also do copy to layer

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,239
as a command type it in

23
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,760
and the object will copy to a layer

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,079
then another question i think you were

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,199
hitting at the idea that

26
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,000
um where the object's parametric and

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,440
these objects as

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,120
they're done as we've done now in mind

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,480
we're not parametric

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,120
therefore they are sort of fixed in size

31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,800
and if you use the scale command the

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,840
move command

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
take command you're moving the polygonal

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
points that control those objects

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,119
but they are not parametric objects

36
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,880
we're going to cover parametric within

37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,680
four and i also said line weights

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,960
weren't in manual

39
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,119
um they are in rhino i've just did not

40
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,240
use them

41
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,600
i would suspect that line weights are

42
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,799
probably more advanced

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,040
in autocad and other cad softwares than

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,560
they are in mynow

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,080
but they are there and i'll have a look

46
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,880
at them later

47
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,399
so um

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,759
so this week we'll be covering curves

49
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,840
and surfaces which

50
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,040
are the sort of main uh

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,119
particles you know they are where when

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,640
i've got to start and i think most of

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,040
its

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
sort of tools and commands are based

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,079
around nerves curves and air surfaces

56
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,680
and when it has brought other types of

57
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,119
geometry into rhino

58
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,560
which sort of seemed almost foreign and

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,240
minor it is using

60
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,200
its tools that are based on its nerve

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,280
geometry to just add function to those

62
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
other things but

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,199
nerves curves is it sort of native

64
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,639
format and that's what we'll be doing

65
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,039
today

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,000
so uh as we said last week

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
rhino has within um its object types

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
points curves and curves are made of

69
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,120
points

70
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,160
curves can be opened or closed uh a

71
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,599
closed surface can be made into a

72
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,560
surface

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,000
a closed curve can be made into a

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,080
surface and then that can be made into

75
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,280
a polysurface or multiple surfaces

76
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
joined together

77
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,200
the beginning of the sort of divide and

78
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,840
curves

79
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,000
is to have mathematical geometry things

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
that we can define by formula such as a

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,640
circle

82
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,680
pi 2 or five by the diameter

83
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
and then sketch lines that are not like

84
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,080
just drawn with a pen and paper and are

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,519
not mathematical

86
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,440
therefore we can't have a computer

87
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,720
reproduce them as

88
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,480
accurately the sort of major advances

89
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,840
made were

90
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,800
done in the 1950s and the 1960s where

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,480
the sort of mathematical curve was

92
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,440
made for the first time and that's

93
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,760
called

94
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,879
spline splines sort of date back

95
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,959
a really long time uh they're used in

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,159
sort of boat building

97
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,920
and a lot of the terminology people use

98
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,519
such as knots goes back

99
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,920
to the more ancient form of actually

100
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
tying knots around things

101
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,319
you kind of see here making a curve with

102
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,080
the nails and wood

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,239
a lot of boat building technique boat

104
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,519
building techniques with the beginning

105
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:35,920
of

106
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,440
uh splines and lofting

107
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,239
so in the 1950s late 1950s the sichuan

108
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,920
version

109
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,519
was the first b-spline and

110
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,519
these two uh french car companies that

111
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,560
phone on renault

112
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,439
were sort of the pioneers of bringing

113
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:53,920
curves

114
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,959
onto computers for the first time uh

115
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,480
the main reason is they wanted to make

116
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
curves to communicate with the machines

117
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,400
and to communicate with machines they

118
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,000
needed a mathematical basis for curved

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,799
geometry

120
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,080
not just a sketch

121
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,400
so a b spline as far as i understand it

122
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,519
another mathematician

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,760
is the spline where the control points

124
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,280
are not on the curve

125
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,839
that you're drawing so that's just the b

126
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,120
spline

127
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,320
uh basic uh basis line the

128
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,280
uh so citron were very secretive and

129
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,800
private almost like a current day tech

130
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,320
company they did not share

131
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,600
how they made this magical type of curve

132
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,360
uh although all the other car companies

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,639
knew they had made

134
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,600
that curve so renault wanted to make the

135
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,440
curve they had their sort of genius

136
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,000
in-house pier bezier and he was tasked

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
with figuring out

138
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,080
how citron made the curve and he came up

139
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,639
with

140
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,919
his type of curved surface which he

141
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,160
thought was possibly identical to other

142
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,120
curses

143
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,639
other type of curves but it's actually

144
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,080
quite different so his curves are called

145
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,040
bezier curves

146
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,800
they were another big advance at the

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,639
time they were

148
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,520
his attempt to copy uh the secretive

149
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,800
projects of citron

150
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,000
and they defined renault cards

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,720
a lot of sort of mathematical uh phds in

152
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,600
the process

153
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,199
um us students sort of taking influence

154
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,000
on these

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
two french car companies and general

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,240
motors uh began to do the non-uniform

157
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,199
b-splines

158
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,120
which just meant the nuts on the curves

159
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,639
were uh

160
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,560
unevenly spaced as opposed to equally

161
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,639
spaced i'm just kind of introducing the

162
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,440
car companies

163
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,000
and companies that sort of brought these

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,880
curves forward

165
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,000
as a sort of funny history of this stuff

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
uh boeing um sort of then took another

167
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,160
mathematical phd which labeled them as

168
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
non-uniform rational b-splines and

169
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,199
boeing were the first company to

170
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,720
use the word nerves because they were

171
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
going to say that in fall

172
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,759
every time and these curves sort of

173
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,280
allow wings and all these parts to be

174
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,440
communicated between drawing and machine

175
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,039
an example of mathematical curves are

176
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,600
this is basic curves on top they in

177
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,440
rhino are known as handle curves

178
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,880
and they basically for every point

179
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,479
have a handle to the left and to the

180
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,120
right or one side into the other side

181
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
uh and you kind of stretch that out to

182
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,039
change the original pair of geometry

183
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,919
and i love this comparison between the

184
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,919
old google logo and the new google logo

185
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,400
and you can

186
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,440
see the file size is almost one-tenth

187
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,319
the file size

188
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,319
the bottom one is just using boolean

189
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,000
shapes so it's just

190
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
ten circles five rectangles and the g

191
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,800
the small g is the most complicated one

192
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
but you can see that the file size is

193
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,600
massively reduced because the amount of

194
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,280
polygonal points and data

195
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,240
is enormously reduced basically curves

196
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,639
dominate graphic design the main curve

197
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,639
of adobe illustrator

198
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,280
uh most fonts are made of busy curves

199
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,120
so we use them every day

200
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,039
the curves in lineup are

201
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,520
a circle or a primitive curve is just

202
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,960
the mathematics of the circle

203
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,440
control point curve is the nerve's curve

204
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,880
that is the main type of

205
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,759
uh curving minor you draw points they're

206
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,080
not

207
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,840
those points the control points are not

208
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,120
on the curve itself

209
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,720
but as you move them around they kind of

210
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,880
control the geometry of the curve

211
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,639
an interpolated curve is where the

212
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,639
points are on the curve

213
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,960
and handle curve we've already covered

214
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,680
and a

215
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,880
conical curve is for any type of

216
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,400
parabolas have verbalized

217
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,919
again mathematically defined curves

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,840
so the first thing you need to know

219
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,400
about

220
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,520
nurbs curves is the degree degree is

221
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,680
from every control point

222
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,360
uh how many sides uh

223
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,840
either side of the point is it going to

224
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,400
look to calculate its geometry

225
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,720
so in a first degree curve it's it's

226
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,000
just looking at itself

227
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,479
and as a result a first degree curve or

228
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,759
degree of

229
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,160
degree one is going to have straight

230
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,960
lines between each of the control points

231
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,680
uh when the degree is turned to two it's

232
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,800
looking at itself

233
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,120
and one curve either side of it to

234
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,800
calculate the position

235
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
of the curve uh

236
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,919
when you go to the degree of three it's

237
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,319
going sort of two points either side of

238
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,599
it and itself

239
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,440
um to calculate its strong gene as you

240
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,680
can think if you have 10 000 or 100 000

241
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,879
points in the model

242
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,759
and you're with a degree of three that

243
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,679
means every point is referencing itself

244
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,000
and two points either side of it to

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,599
calculate its position

246
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,559
it starts to get a lot of mathematics

247
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,919
going on in the background

248
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,760
but most computers today are not going

249
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,360
to struggle at a degree of freedom

250
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
as you go before

251
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
[Music]

252
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
older computers would really struggle on

253
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,839
four but now probably not so much

254
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,000
as you keep going up here you're just

255
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,760
exponentially increasing the amount of

256
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,360
uh processing power the computer is

257
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,880
going to need

258
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,399
the um most people would model

259
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,240
in a degree of three if they wanted to

260
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,920
do a kind of curvy geometry and then

261
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,760
historically they would render in four

262
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
or five which would give a smoother

263
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,360
geometry to it but they they would

264
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
choose a different degree on the

265
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,200
curvature

266
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,399
for rendering and modeling sometimes

267
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,000
depending on your geometry as you can

268
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,640
see here just

269
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,440
as we go from one to two to three the

270
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,560
underlying curve

271
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,519
is actually moving slightly and as you

272
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,959
change the degree your challenger can

273
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,720
move so sometimes when

274
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,200
geometry if you're going to render a

275
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,959
different geometry using model

276
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,680
things can become loose or you can have

277
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,040
mistakes in your model because you're

278
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,480
not expecting them

279
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,320
to sort of come apart in a higher

280
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,680
degree point count is

281
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,399
um another thing we can look at so each

282
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,240
one of these curves has 10 points or

283
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
sorry the first one is 10 points

284
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
and then i did a rebuild command which

285
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,279
i'll show you when we open vinyl to

286
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,640
reduce the point count

287
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,760
to nine eight and

288
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,360
you can increase it or decrease it to

289
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,279
whatever you want it to be

290
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,600
but as you see that the the geometry of

291
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,560
the curve as you

292
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
change the point count is going to

293
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,320
deform so you kind of want

294
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,399
in general the lowest number of points

295
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,680
possible

296
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,839
but you don't want to lose control of

297
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,920
the geometry that you want to produce

298
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,640
um so sometimes there's there's a sort

299
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,360
of minimum

300
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
number needed if you were to offset a

301
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,040
curve

302
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,680
um you can kind of see these sort of two

303
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,839
choke points

304
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,800
here and here um and therefore offset

305
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,040
curves can sometimes

306
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,160
not depending on the underlying geometry

307
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,399
cannot look exactly the way you want

308
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,320
and one of the reasons uh if you see the

309
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,680
number of control points we have 10 on

310
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,800
the original curve

311
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,760
we have many points on the offset curve

312
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,800
so sometimes

313
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
you want to either rebuild offset curves

314
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,079
or

315
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,200
think about how you're going to

316
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,360
construct geometry that you might not be

317
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,079
using the offset command

318
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,279
sometimes if your geometry causes points

319
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,640
to overlap

320
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,320
um that can cause problems down the line

321
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,240
so if you're using a for example cnc

322
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,560
machine and send an offset curve to it

323
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,399
sometimes the router bit might stay in

324
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,600
the same area and that would cause a

325
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,120
fire so

326
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,240
knowing where the points are in the

327
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
geometry

328
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
can be important to sort of down the

329
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,320
line

330
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,160
uh when you're trying to move points um

331
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,440
this is what i'm on about having the

332
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,519
least number of points necessary

333
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,720
so if i was to move the point uh from

334
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,279
the

335
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,200
inner curve the original curve you can

336
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,120
see i can sort of deform that geometry

337
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,440
quite

338
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,320
well but if i move one point from the

339
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,920
outer curve because there's way too many

340
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,560
points

341
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,880
it's kind of just going to move that

342
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,639
tiny amount of geometry

343
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,440
um and as a result sort of it's just

344
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
going to like poke out

345
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,120
so if we wanted to do this sort of

346
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,880
smoothly we need to rebuild

347
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,240
the outer curve to a smaller point count

348
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,519
in order to deform it there's all the

349
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,360
regular tools that you would expect in

350
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,800
any sort of uh

351
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,079
cad soccer extend trim fill it

352
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,519
um in in a fillet you're going to set

353
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,880
the the radius and then select the uh

354
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,480
two curves and it's going to determine

355
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
if you set a radius that's way too big

356
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,600
or which is small it's just not going to

357
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,639
work and will tell you that in the

358
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,120
command bar

359
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,160
you can divide a curve uh by just typing

360
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,279
divide and setting

361
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,800
a number and in this case divide by 10

362
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,240
and we're going to start our first

363
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
exercise as drawing

364
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
a chess piece and we're going to drag a

365
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,079
jpeg

366
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,839
or an image into rhino

367
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,480
and then trace around it and we can i'll

368
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,600
show you two different ways that we can

369
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,399
trace around it

370
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,920
and we're going to use a revolve command

371
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,839
which will bring the curve

372
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:07,839
towards being a surface so

373
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:21,839
can you see right now yeah

374
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,240
so the first command i'm going to use

375
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,959
this there's

376
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,560
several different ways of bringing an

377
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,720
image into rhino

378
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,160
wallpaper is probably the least useful

379
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,279
um i'll just show you what that does if

380
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,000
i type wallpaper it asks me for

381
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,320
select my jpeg and i'm going to select

382
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,040
this phone

383
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,360
so that just puts it as a sort of

384
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
wallpaper command puts it as a

385
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,519
background

386
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,440
if i zoom in and zoom out that's just

387
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,720
solidly back there

388
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
not quite sure the function of this but

389
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,920
it's not particularly useful for what i

390
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,040
wanted to do

391
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,600
so i can see here that i can remove it

392
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,639
with this command but i'm going to

393
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,680
remove it

394
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,800
the other two are background bitmap

395
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,920
which i type into the top

396
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,199
[Music]

397
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,800
and this time it's it's going to ask for

398
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,320
the first corner and i select

399
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,519
a point and then it wants me to select

400
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,440
the second corner so i'm just going to

401
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,040
type 200

402
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,360
so that's now in there

403
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,480
um i can't click it it's sort of just

404
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,800
locked in the background and

405
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,519
it's in one view so it's not actually a

406
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,480
sort of object

407
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,240
in there so i'm going to click remove

408
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,600
from the options in the command bar

409
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,120
and then i will just type

410
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,360
escape to get out of that picture

411
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,839
and i'll select my phone again

412
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,000
[Music]

413
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,160
so

414
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,720
now our picture is a

415
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,199
[Music]

416
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,120
an object in our file so it's in all

417
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,399
views i can

418
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,199
click it i can move it i can scale it

419
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,399
far easier to move

420
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,600
so picture is the command uh just

421
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,320
dragging that

422
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:41,839
i'm going to turn my layers on

423
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,399
so i'm just going to create a new layer

424
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,040
and put my

425
00:15:53,040 --> 00:16:08,800
picture so i can just type move

426
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,680
let's make one

427
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,839
and i can lock that layer

428
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,360
so now in the top view

429
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,800
she could rotate this i'll rotate it

430
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
afterwards so

431
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,800
nurbs curves or a polyline is a one

432
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,680
degree curve

433
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,839
um and you can kind of left click to

434
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,279
select out that menu

435
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,320
and see either a single line

436
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,480
a polyline with multiple points and see

437
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,079
all these other options

438
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,680
or this one here which is the main

439
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,519
curves and you can see control point

440
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,040
curve is the first

441
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,720
uh if you right click this one and

442
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,680
handle curve it's also the fourth option

443
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,120
and you can see these two ones so if i

444
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,000
just do a control point curve

445
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,839
and then i left click on different

446
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,359
points which maybe this is the

447
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,190
all right probably shouldn't have chosen

448
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,499
[Music]

449
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,640
rather than go find another jpeg

450
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,360
so if you were to draw a free-form curve

451
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,280
you wouldn't be able to really

452
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,559
get that that well

453
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,840
but you would be able to get it trace it

454
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,080
on a different database

455
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,700
so one way to do it is

456
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,960
[Music]

457
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:00,480
to do a circle

458
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:15,840
and do another circle here

459
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:29,840
and and a bunch of rectangles in as well

460
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,240
um one thing i wanted to mention as well

461
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,280
is the difference between

462
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,840
if you select while dragging from the

463
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,039
left

464
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,039
um that selects all the options that you

465
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,480
sort of entirely cover but if you select

466
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,760
starting from the right corner and

467
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,400
moving in that any object

468
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,400
partially covered is selected slightly

469
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
different

470
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,559
so i wish i had chosen a better image

471
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,120
next time

472
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,160
so now i can use the trim command and

473
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,039
um i guess this is getting the left and

474
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,720
right click

475
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,480
uh right so i'm going to like left click

476
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,799
an object then right click and then left

477
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,320
click to trim

478
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,559
so let's just get really used to the

479
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,880
order

480
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,559
and i can sort of explode

481
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,960
explode any curve as well

482
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
i select a whole bunch of options and i

483
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,559
just dream quickly

484
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:35,840
but command

485
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,039
okay so now we have a sort of curve

486
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,000
which is made of

487
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,200
a whole bunch of separate types of

488
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,159
curves

489
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,880
some of them are straight some are parts

490
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,080
of circles some of them

491
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,520
just trim and i can select all of them

492
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,880
and type join and now that's

493
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,400
one curve

494
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,320
and if i that's currently sort of flat

495
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,799
on the ground so i want to do a rotate

496
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,360
3d

497
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,840
to to make it more vertical

498
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,240
if i'm going to rotate 3d choose this as

499
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
the base plane

500
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,799
rotate around here and rotate that

501
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,120
upward

502
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,400
so now i can use a revolve command which

503
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,760
is one way we can go from

504
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,880
a curve to a surface

505
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,400
so if i select this curve that is the

506
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,280
profile of the

507
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,760
pawn and enter

508
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,120
and i'm going to do um select this end

509
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,240
point at the top

510
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,320
and control click downwards doesn't

511
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,760
matter the distance gives us just an

512
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,039
axis

513
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,679
and then left click and drag it around

514
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,320
the whole way

515
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,600
and there is my chest

516
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,120
so um i thought rather than do a

517
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,360
the long lecture i did last time um

518
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,640
we're going to kind of

519
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,320
break this up a bit more and do where i

520
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,919
do some instruction then we do an

521
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,120
exercise then i do some more

522
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,840
instructions sort of go back

523
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,760
so if you want to start trying to draw

524
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,880
this chess piece

525
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,440
and then ask any questions we'll take

526
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,080
sort of

527
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,200
uh 10 minutes or so and let me know when

528
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,400
you're done

529
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,679
and i'll still be here able to but

530
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,480
start drawing and see if you can just

531
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,159
google find an image on the internet

532
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,360
drag it in through using picture and

533
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,840
create the chess piece

534
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,159
and you're best to use a pawn because

535
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,880
some of the other chess pieces require

536
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,240
some more complicated moves that we

537
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:51,840
haven't covered yet

538
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,480
okay trim sorry i just saw your question

539
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,799
um

540
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,639
i'm just gonna make some uh

541
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
curves

542
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,640
so if i have two overlapping curves

543
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,840
and i type trim it says um

544
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,400
from the top select the object to trim

545
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,240
first and if i shift select if i will

546
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,360
select multiple objects

547
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,400
press it select cutting object first so

548
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,080
i select the cutting object and then i

549
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,320
right click or press enter and then

550
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,760
select the object to trim

551
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,520
and i left click that and it trims it

552
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,600
you can always just follow the

553
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,960
instructions here so select the cutting

554
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,400
object first

555
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,919
then select the and then you just kind

556
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,600
of left click to trim and you can do

557
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,960
multiple trends

558
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:29,840
as you want

559
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,918
you

560
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,918
you

561
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,840
also one thing um if you left click

562
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,279
select something

563
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,120
and then you hold shift down and you

564
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,279
left click it adds to the selection

565
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,000
and if you let go that's all selected

566
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,760
and then if you hold ctrl and you left

567
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,080
click

568
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:49,840
that subtracts on the selection

569
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
to

570
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,200
are people getting on okay or does

571
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,240
anyone tell me how they're doing

572
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:13,840
you're a bit faster james

573
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,679
for professional rhino modelers they

574
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,760
turn mass sensitivity up to max

575
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,080
and they really do this left click right

576
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,799
click dance at an amazing speed

577
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,090
um

578
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,290
[Music]

579
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,559
it can be really awkward if you turn my

580
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:09,840
sensitivity up otherwise

581
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,919
how to place a jpeg in rhino three

582
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:16,559
options

583
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,600
type wallpaper type fabric background

584
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,039
bitmap or type picture

585
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,519
typing picture is my favorite because it

586
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,720
makes it sort of a clickable

587
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,840
object and then it will prompt you to

588
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,039
select the jpeg and then you will select

589
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,440
the sort of size for it and you can kind

590
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,279
of scale it to make it bigger or smaller

591
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,640
let me know if that makes sense market

592
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,840
certainly more helpful

593
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,840
uh p i c t u r e

594
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,918
you

595
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
okay

596
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,760
so i'll move on at 6 35

597
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,519
um whether you're done right now

598
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,960
hopefully that was enough to play around

599
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,360
with it and just

600
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,840
see how it works

601
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,839
so marcus i shared on the hackaday page

602
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,500

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,239
commands and at the top link

606
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,960
of the google spreadsheet is a link to

607
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,719
the rhino page that has every command

608
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,839
and the program

609
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
and the

610
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,719
google spreadsheet just has a lot of the

611
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,359
main commands of the week that i've used

612
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,040
like given there is quite a lot because

613
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,920
the overall program

614
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,520
but learning the vocabulary of all right

615
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,960
thanks man that's great

616
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,880
um learning vocabulary in rhino is kind

617
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,560
of like learning the language of the

618
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
software that you kind of

619
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,800
use it a lot of time if you type what

620
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
you intuitively think

621
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,040
might work into the command bar then

622
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,800
that might work because it

623
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,560
it there's only so many

624
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,160
words if you want to mirror something

625
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,200
like there if you want to

626
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,480
move something you tap move um

627
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,040
but it is learning duplicate is is the

628
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,800
word it uses to

629
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,960
duplicate edges on the surfaces to bring

630
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,160
them back to the curves

631
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,000
or um so sel is select

632
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,680
for selecting objects

633
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,000
all right so we'll

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,920
[Music]

635
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,200
how do people get on did anyone

636
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,839
successfully make a pawn

637
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,800
way around no yeah i think i messed up

638
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
just kind of drag it and then you don't

639
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,640
left click until

640
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,520
you see the full 3d a full 360 degree

641
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,800
rotation

642
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,000
okay and uh it's probably snapping

643
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,280
to 90 degree rotations but if you turn

644
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,520
ortho off that would be more fluid where

645
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,800
you'd be able to go to

646
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,640
36 degrees or 128. okay

647
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,240
yeah i think that that was the case

648
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,400
because it snapped right off to

649
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,440
the half the pawn yeah

650
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,560
you could just mirror the surface

651
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,240
and then join the surfaces that would

652
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,760
also work but

653
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,800
um you can also tighten

654
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,839
the angle um so just type 360 and

655
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,119
okay fair enough

656
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,560
so can you see the chat screen on my

657
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,800
screen

658
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,160
[Music]

659
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,200
yep i can see the chat um matt

660
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,560
sent all the um the course

661
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,740

[Music]

663
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,920
all right so i'm gonna let's move on

664
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,520
whether you're

665
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,320
done or not done and you can come back

666
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,960
to that later

667
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
so i mean we've already done some

668
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,839
surfaces but

669
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,079
um just some more commands these are

670
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:34,960
part of the

671
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,800
rhino vocabulary and concepts

672
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,200
to type into the command planar surface

673
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,480
is one way to just take

674
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,680
a flat curve and add a surface of that

675
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,440
curve

676
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,160
a lot of the time if you have a curve

677
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,359
and you like plane a surface

678
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,920
then you will have a curve and a surface

679
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,800
which you could

680
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,480
delete the curve or move it to another

681
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,000
layer or

682
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,720
or in the options in some commands you

683
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,160
could type delete input

684
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,640
and that means that the curve will

685
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,800
create a surface and then delete itself

686
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,640
there's different options on whether you

687
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
want to keep your construction geometry

688
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,280
or you

689
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,000
want to get rid of it

690
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,240
if a curve is not flat um

691
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,480
patch surface will just or sorry a

692
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,440
planar surface

693
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,520
will just say it won't work because the

694
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,119
curve is not planar

695
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,200
um so i drew this kind of pringle like

696
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,599
shape that the pringle potato chips

697
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,400
and um for this one you could use patch

698
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,920
command

699
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,760
and these lines uh on top here

700
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,520
which uh we may not cover but

701
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,040
they're called iso curves and they have

702
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,960
a a u and a v

703
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,440
direction as opposed to an x or y and

704
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,119
that's just to mean that they are

705
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,520
local to the geometry as opposed to the

706
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,240
world

707
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,680
x y z axis um so they're uv

708
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,680
or iso curves which have a uv direction

709
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,440
only important for more advanced stuff

710
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,160
so a close curve if we were to extrude

711
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,520
it is another way to

712
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,680
take a curve and make it into a

713
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,640
surface or polysurface depending on the

714
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,359
initial curve

715
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,599
actually you could extrude an open curve

716
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:20,480
as well that would just

717
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,680
be a sort of open surface

718
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,520
in the sub options for the extrude

719
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,359
command you can type

720
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,079
cap on or tap off or it might be solid

721
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,920
on or solid off

722
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
and that would automatically add a

723
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,760
surface at the top and the bottom

724
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,400
when you extrude that curve if you

725
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,440
forget to do that

726
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,480
you could just take the geometry here

727
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,160
from the left extruded and type

728
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,040
cap and it would put a cap on the top

729
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,839
and the bottom

730
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,480
but that would only work if the top and

731
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:50,960
the bottom

732
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,680
are planar curves would not work if they

733
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,960
needed to be patched

734
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,720
but you could just patch into them as

735
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
well

736
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,400
so some of the options you might be

737
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,000
asked in the command bar when you

738
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,880
extrude

739
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
you obviously need a distance and the

740
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,400
default distance if you just press

741
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
enter is currently set to 10 if it looks

742
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,480
like this if you just write a number at

743
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,119
the end

744
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,560
that's going to change your extrusion

745
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,800
distance to a new distance

746
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,920
you can type the letter of

747
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,599
that's underlined in any of these

748
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,960
options so that could be direct

749
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,240
d for direction b for both sides uh

750
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,280
to to extrude both sides of the curve

751
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,960
uh solid which is the cover of an

752
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,160
undelete impulse i mentioned

753
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,560
so if we look at this uh vas by uh

754
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,839
albert also

755
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,000
um this is just a sort of squiggle with

756
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,560
a control point curve or nerves curve

757
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,720
draw the squiggle and then extrude and

758
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,680
you're pretty much done

759
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,160
do one count on the bottom it's slightly

760
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,079
tapered which you can see here

761
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,040
which uh you can do a tapered extrude or

762
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,400
use one of the more dense ones we

763
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,280
learned later but

764
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,119
for the most part it's just a nurbs

765
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,960
curve and an extrusion

766
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,400
and that's going to produce that

767
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,319
geometry it's it's pretty simple

768
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,760
this is um just a fun project at

769
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,200
by heatherwick and

770
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,400
he saw that i-beams for

771
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,920
construction and building were

772
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,960
heated up and then pushed through

773
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,920
a dye which can be quite expensive and

774
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,440
that's how you produce an i-beam

775
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,520
and at the end when it either cooled

776
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,640
down a little

777
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,280
you got this uh weird effect and then

778
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,800
that part was just chopped off

779
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,200
and the good part was sold as an iv

780
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,359
this is a an extrusion um

781
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,839
deliberately trying to exploit that uh

782
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,119
off cut at the end

783
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,599
to produce a he paid out of his own

784
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,960
money personal project

785
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,400
a couple hundred thousand to make the

786
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,800
die of the chair and then pushed through

787
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,240
the aluminium and was kind of more

788
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,560
interested in these strange shapes at

789
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,599
the end

790
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,079
and i just think that's a cool extrusion

791
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,839
project since we're talking a lot about

792
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,400
exclusion

793
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,280
so lofting is um the next command we're

794
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,920
going to learn

795
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,680
in surface geometry and lofting is where

796
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,520
you have uh two curves uh in this case

797
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,240
one at the top and one at the bottom and

798
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,880
you type

799
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,200
loft command and loft will sort of

800
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,520
create this geometry in one go it sort

801
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,440
of just blends the two curves into each

802
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,560
other or creates

803
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,480
surfaces that sort of morph between the

804
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,400
two curves

805
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,800
and here's an example of

806
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,859
[Music]

807
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,520
towers in toronto created by mad

808
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,760
architects and they are a chinese

809
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,560
practice

810
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,000
that was the first time a chinese

811
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,720
architect won a project in north america

812
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,319
sort of reversing the direction of more

813
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,000
typically north american architects

814
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,640
winning

815
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,160
projects in china and it's just

816
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,839
a bunch of ellipses rotated maybe three

817
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,119
uh top middle and bottom and

818
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,440
a loft command and that's it so you just

819
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,200
draw three elixirs rotate them put them

820
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,079
in space

821
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,160
type loft and it will just blend this

822
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,119
geometry to create the overall surface

823
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,400
the contour command is um

824
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,560
how we would sort of divide it almost

825
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,119
like a chopping salami or chopping a

826
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,079
cucumber

827
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,319
and we would just set a distance of

828
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,839
thickness that we want each floor plate

829
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:26,720
to be or

830
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,079
distance between each uh chop

831
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,520
and we'll we'll draw this in minor

832
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,280
it's quite well i think it's quite

833
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,839
simple to draw

834
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,440
and once we contour it we will have the

835
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,400
curves

836
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,880
and then while we contour they will be

837
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,240
already selected

838
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,680
we could move them onto a layer when

839
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,880
they're already selected so that we

840
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,440
don't

841
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,160
lose control of them or we could extrude

842
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,200
them or tap them

843
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,560
or do that

844
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,160
so there's an example of a bunch of

845
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,880
ellipses

846
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,760
rotated on the top tap a loft command

847
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,880
and it just

848
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,000
blends the surface through um

849
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,800
those original construction geometry and

850
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,880
then if we use a contour command

851
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,280
and set a sort of even distance it

852
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,359
chucks that up with an even geometry

853
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,319
and we'll get curves and if we extrude

854
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,359
those curves and type solid

855
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,760
or cap those curves will end up with the

856
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,560
floor plates

857
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,759
that is the right model here

858
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,800
a more complicated one is this piece of

859
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,359
furniture by uh wristy graduate

860
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,040
uh mathias facing case name um

861
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,280
and in this case you've got this curve

862
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,359
here on the left which is drawn

863
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,920
some of uh a sort of cross section curve

864
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,119
for the middle

865
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,960
uh maybe five or six of them and then

866
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,880
tie it off and it makes this fluid

867
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,400
geometry so

868
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,839
all you need to draw is the

869
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,160
cross-section curves five or six of them

870
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,880
and type loft and you reduce the overall

871
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,839
form

872
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,520
um

873
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,920
of course this making this in real life

874
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,079
uh and the guy he does is

875
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,079
he i'm almost sure he does use my no and

876
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,680
he does use the loft command

877
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,480
and then um the actual physical building

878
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:16,880
is

879
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,079
is weeks or months of steam bending wood

880
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:20,800
so it

881
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,319
takes a while to build it in the real

882
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,319
world but the rhino model side

883
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,839
is um not so hard to

884
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,400
draw that

885
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,839
and the last command we'll cover is the

886
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:34,960
sweep command

887
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,800
and this is sort of a more advanced

888
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,160
version of

889
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,839
uh loft

890
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,960
where we're going to give

891
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,560
rails to the uh law so

892
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,030
um

893
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:52,000
[Music]

894
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,280
uh if um if we were to

895
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,480
uh loft these uh red lines

896
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,839
which were the cross sections of this

897
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,760
couch that it might not produce a

898
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,880
perfect circle so

899
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,000
we want rails for it to sort of keep on

900
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,920
the rails

901
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,040
if i go back in slides here to

902
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,160
the the furniture piece

903
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,680
yeah we could use rails at the bottom

904
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,520
to uh to move the geometry further

905
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,880
and then sweep these cross sections but

906
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,599
to follow the bottom rails

907
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,079
so we can sweep with one rails we've got

908
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,599
two rails they're separate amounts sweep

909
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:38,800
ones with two

910
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,480
unlocked there are sort of main commands

911
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,760
that we're going to do for the next

912
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,160
project

913
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,160
this geometry just to show you um

914
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,640
some of the stuff is from maybe next

915
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,240
week that we have the um

916
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,000
the bottom legs but if you forget about

917
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,680
the legs on this project

918
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,160
that you could draw this edge kind of

919
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,359
bean shape

920
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,760
and draw the bean shape at the top draw

921
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,359
a squished one in the middle and maybe

922
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,800
one or two other cross sections

923
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,920
and then loft those curves or do a sweep

924
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,640
two and

925
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,079
and use rails to control uh the geometry

926
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:16,880
better

927
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,560
but without the legs there you could

928
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,800
produce that geometry using loft and

929
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,319
sweep commands

930
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,400
this is a um another project by

931
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,920
heatherwick

932
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,079
we could just draw these edge curves in

933
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,480
in rhino and then just extrude them so

934
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,680
that's

935
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,559
hopefully within your capability to draw

936
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,599
something like that now

937
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,280
and um i'm

938
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,960
you know i mentioned the utah teapot

939
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,240
last week i'm more of a coffee drinker

940
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,200
so if we have time modeling this kettle

941
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,520
or

942
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,760
a chemex it is kind of an interesting

943
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,040
product as well

944
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,319
uh as i'll may show you in rhino that

945
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:03,760
this

946
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,359
connection here is actually quite hard

947
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,880
to model in

948
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,000
nurbs curves and that this problem was

949
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,480
the problem pixar had with the initial

950
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,520
toy story

951
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,200
it's something that's just better done

952
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,040
in subdivision modeling

953
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,359
and uh i'll hopefully get a chance to

954
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,839
show you why

955
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,280
so now i'm going to jump back into

956
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,720
rhino and we'll draw the contour towers

957
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,359
okay so i'm just not too interested in

958
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,280
keeping this but you can kind of

959
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,319
um file save model if you want save as

960
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,359
and save the model and then file new to

961
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:46,480
create a new model

962
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,700
i'm just going to ctrl a and delete

963
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,819
[Music]

964
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,280
so if i start in the top view

965
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,839
and i start with

966
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,359
i'm just gonna draw a circle and i'm

967
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,440
just gonna type zero comma zero

968
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:16,640
comma zero and um

969
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,960
let's say thirty thousand which would be

970
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,720
thirty thousand millimeters as a circle

971
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,680
and then

972
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,520
control a zoom or zed

973
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,720
all be used when i selected it

974
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,440
so and all the users will go to my

975
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,240
segment

976
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,839
so i just have that to create a sense of

977
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,160
scale

978
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,480
so i'm going to do a nurbs curve

979
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,559
so just left click on the control

980
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,000
pointer

981
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,480
and go into the top view

982
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,240
i want to turn some of the snaps off

983
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,839
because i want to i don't want it to

984
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,480
snap to the circle

985
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,319
i just wanted to use the circle as

986
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,800
a scale so that i'm creating something

987
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,920
that's roughly

988
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,880
60 meters in its flow plate

989
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,839
and i'm gonna

990
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,680
so there is a sort of a

991
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,119
curve so if i type copy

992
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,640
and i select any one of these control

993
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,800
points to move it and i'm going to

994
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,200
control click or command click on that

995
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,940
to move it up

996
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,480
[Music]

997
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,480
let's say 100 meters which in

998
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,920
millimeters would be a hundred

999
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,969
[Music]

1000
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:54,720
thousand

1001
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:09,839
so move

1002
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,079
okay and then i'll go back into the top

1003
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:23,839
view and i'll just rotate it a bit

1004
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,119
and then i'll copy another one of these

1005
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:27,680
and

1006
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,720
control click and move it up

1007
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,839
200 000 which is 200 meters

1008
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,920
so now we're going to have a 200 meter

1009
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,960
tall

1010
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,800
tower if i have these three curves

1011
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,280
selected so that's left click select

1012
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,839
or hold down shift and select row 3 and

1013
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:44,720
type

1014
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,920
loft and it's it's we're just going to

1015
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,599
press enter not worry about the same

1016
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,839
point

1017
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,359
and you may have drawn some geometry

1018
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:55,760
that

1019
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,880
is probably bad so

1020
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,559
actually it's just

1021
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:19,839
maybe i won't rotate this as much

1022
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,839
so that's kind of a lot of geometry

1023
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,920
um probably not the most efficient tower

1024
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,480
to build but

1025
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,400
and uh i'm going to scale

1026
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,480
1d or stretch it because it just looks a

1027
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,839
bit short

1028
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,000
so i don't care about capping this

1029
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,880
geometry but if i typed cap

1030
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,480
it would turn it into a solid and cap

1031
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,000
weapons but i'm going to control z

1032
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,760
um i'm also just going to

1033
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,800
select curves sel crv

1034
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,880
and delete those curves because i don't

1035
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,319
want them to interfere with

1036
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,760
uh later and

1037
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,880
now i can left click to select the sorry

1038
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,480
tower geometry

1039
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,720
and type contour and it says contour

1040
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,960
plane base point so this is just for the

1041
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,800
the plane so i can just click anywhere

1042
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,920
for this one

1043
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,319
and direction perpendicular to contour

1044
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:34,960
planes

1045
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,280
basically asking what direction do i do

1046
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,640
i make the slices

1047
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,319
so i'm going to control click on this

1048
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,480
original plane so that it's a vertical

1049
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,119
line

1050
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,880
and say i want the slices to be vertical

1051
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,800
and then a distance so let's do a four

1052
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,920
meter or four thousand millimeter plate

1053
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,040
and it's going to divide

1054
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,559
that surface

1055
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,520
every 4 meters

1056
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,680
so we can just drag

1057
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,040
curves away from our surface and now we

1058
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,950
have

1059
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,280
[Music]

1060
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,559
our sort of curves

1061
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,599
depending on how you constructed

1062
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,079
the curves they could be or if you had

1063
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,480
poly surfaces or um

1064
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,359
non-joined surfaces when you do that

1065
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:34,319
contour command

1066
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,040
these curves may not be closed so you

1067
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,000
can use the

1068
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,079
close curve command that just

1069
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,040
automatically closes the curve

1070
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,319
that's especially useful if

1071
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,730
your curve might be open by

1072
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,119
[Music]

1073
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,119
zero one of a .00001 you can't see it

1074
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,240
and you don't know where it is

1075
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,559
you can type close curve and it just

1076
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,400
finds that gap and shuts it

1077
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,000
it's not the most accurate way of doing

1078
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,520
it and probably

1079
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,440
a little better investigation to why

1080
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,040
that's open and

1081
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,599
fix it but closed curve is just a fast

1082
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:08,960
way to

1083
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,400
make the curve close just to kind of

1084
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,760
patch it up

1085
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,240
and now i still have all these curves

1086
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,440
selected

1087
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,680
i want to extrude them so i type extrude

1088
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,559
curve

1089
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,040
and uh just to highlight on the commands

1090
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,640
extrude curve and extrude surface are

1091
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,000
two different commands

1092
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,599
and extrude curve won't work on surfaces

1093
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,040
and extreme surface won't work on

1094
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,520
the curve so you have to be specific

1095
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,640
what object type you're going to extrude

1096
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,400
and uh i have both sides

1097
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,839
no i've solid yes it's good delete

1098
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:47,040
input no fine and it's

1099
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,680
it's it's currently extruding based on

1100
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,359
how much i'm dragging which is way too

1101
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,000
much

1102
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,240
so i know that i'm going to type in 400

1103
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,480
as a as a hype of a floor plate

1104
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,160
and now i have my sort of tower

1105
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,170
with no columns but um

1106
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:09,340
[Music]

1107
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,599
and had i have used ellipses rotated i

1108
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,680
would have ended up with the same

1109
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,200
type of tower as um in toronto

1110
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,040
so that's one exercise that we're going

1111
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:25,760
to do

1112
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,359
now and talk through as

1113
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,400
i'm going to draw just very quickly the

1114
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,200
bench project

1115
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,439
and show you the suite command

1116
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,040
i'm just going to

1117
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,240
or i'll just do it to the side i'm just

1118
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:46,880
gonna hide

1119
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,230
this geometry and um

1120
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:53,300
[Music]

1121
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,920
so i'm gonna type to create a 500

1122
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,079
millimeter by

1123
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:04,079
uh let's say 15 meter

1124
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,620
15 000 millimeter finally

1125
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,160
[Music]

1126
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,000
and then ctrl a zoom

1127
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,700
selected um

1128
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,359
[Music]

1129
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:19,839
so there's um just as a scale reference

1130
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,760
to creating this kind of bench project

1131
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,559
and i'm gonna turn my snaps back on

1132
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,290
very simply

1133
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:32,880
[Music]

1134
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,079
and on this 10

1135
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,839
axis i'm going to draw some

1136
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:40,000
cross-sectional

1137
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,080
curves so there's a very simple one

1138
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,920
[Music]

1139
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,079
and if i snap to the midpoint so i'll

1140
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:55,839
get slightly

1141
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,920
maybe we do somewhere we go off

1142
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:09,839
in different directions

1143
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,839
okay so

1144
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,599
using just endpoints and midpoints i've

1145
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,040
just created these curves and i'm just

1146
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,640
going to drag them

1147
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,250
along anywhere along this

1148
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,389
[Music]

1149
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,839
rock shape is just so i know

1150
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:50,940
what is

1151
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,059
[Music]

1152
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,598
dragging the point rather than the

1153
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,839
object

1154
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,799
so i have these curves uh separated if i

1155
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:11,760
was to select them

1156
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,480
and type off i would end up with a kind

1157
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,240
of bench shape and if i was to contour

1158
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,799
i'd have places

1159
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,839
but if i'm to draw

1160
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,799
two rails

1161
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:34,000
this is what they would be in the loft

1162
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:46,079
okay

1163
00:59:46,079 --> 01:00:01,839
now i can

1164
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:15,599
the other way

1165
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,920
and then i can also rotate some of this

1166
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,839
geometry

1167
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,280
these two got skewed

1168
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,640
so now if i do sweep two that says

1169
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,480
select the first rail select the second

1170
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,599
round

1171
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,799
select the cross sections

1172
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,559
i get back and if i played around with

1173
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:57,280
that

1174
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,680
overall shape i would end up with

1175
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,119
something with that bench

1176
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,760
and then similar to before i can do

1177
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,799
contour

1178
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:09,040
select the direction of the contour and

1179
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,240
let's do 36 millimeters

1180
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,319
and i get my curves

1181
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,760
so in this case they're open on the

1182
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,200
bottom

1183
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,680
which is a good example of when i'd want

1184
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,480
to use

1185
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,920
the close curve so now

1186
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,359
i created all my curves and drag that

1187
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,160
out

1188
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,160
so all of these curves are open and if i

1189
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,319
just type with all of them selected

1190
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:39,359
close curve they all close perfectly on

1191
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,359
the bottom

1192
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,640
and then if i do extrude curve by

1193
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,520
18 millimeters of plywood um they're

1194
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,640
currently

1195
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,480
extruding vertically which is not the

1196
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,400
direction i want so i can type d

1197
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,599
enter or click direction up here

1198
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,079
and i want to make sure the direction of

1199
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,960
the extrusion

1200
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,000
extrude curve

1201
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,760
so select one point and select it on

1202
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,480
that axis

1203
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,119
and then type 18 millimeters

1204
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,680
and that should give me my kind of bench

1205
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,839
project of

1206
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,400
a very inefficient plywood kind of

1207
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,799
surface

1208
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,839
and if i move it to a render view

1209
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,280
so you can follow along and create sort

1210
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,720
of organic geometry

1211
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,839
this way so if you guys start drawing

1212
01:02:49,839 --> 01:03:03,839
again ask questions in the chat

1213
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,319
you
