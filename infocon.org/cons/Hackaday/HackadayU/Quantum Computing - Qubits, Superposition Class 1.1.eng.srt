[Music]

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,800
all right

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,360
thanks everyone for coming and i'm

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,719
kidding

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,200
a little bit about myself i work at

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,640
microsoft in the

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,840
quantum systems team so quantum

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,560
education and producing materials and

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,519
content to

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,000
teach the public and our customers is

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,199
part of my

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,240
label but i also have

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,600
a passion for art so i'm kind of trying

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,880
to

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,600
learn to combine science and technology

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
with art together

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
so i have a background in

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,239
condensed matter physics so i did my phd

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:46,640
in

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,719
applied physics in harvard and before

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,680
that i was in

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,879
university of cambridge started with

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,280
low temperature experiments

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,320
trying to study the quantum

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,600
phenomena of materials and i moved

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,280
more and more towards applications and

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,200
worked at intel and then microsoft

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,080
a lot of entrepreneurship and silicon

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,520
photonics

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,240
so now i'm back in quantum that's kind

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,960
of how

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,400
where i started so it's very exciting

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,759
that this industry is emerging

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,640
and there's a lot interesting

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
information out there

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
and quantum computing is a subject that

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,680
involves

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,000
a lot of different areas there's math

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and physics there's also software and

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,960
hard work

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,399
so i hope that this class will uh

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,680
background and have some

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,640
pointers to start digging deeper into

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,000
the subject

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,119
so we're gonna we're not gonna do it uh

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,479
in the crammed way we're gonna uh have

47
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,840
the soft landing so it will be

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,000
pretty short every week we're gonna have

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,880
30 minutes

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,720
to discuss a concept so that also

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,760
can include theory there's also hardware

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
aspects i will show people

53
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,360
and there's also programming that i can

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,800
lead people to the places they can learn

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,120
how

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,000
they can start coding and programming on

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,599
a quantum computer

58
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,360
so i have a project

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,680
on hackaday and thanks hackaday for

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,480
hosting this

61
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,680
virtual class it's called introduction

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
to quantum computing and he has

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,280
um a summary of this

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,560
project i i started using comics

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,360
to explain the concepts every wednesday

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,800
and sunday i would

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,920
post an update and information about the

68
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,840
class will also be posted there

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,800
so you can follow there to look at what

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,440
topic

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,159
will be discussed for the week it will

72
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,920
it will help if you

73
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,040
see you have seen this before we start

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,360
this

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,400
30 minute discussion and throughout the

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
week feel free to post

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,519
comments post questions and discuss

78
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,560
with your peers on the hackaday project

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,360
and i want to make this very interactive

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
and so it's not just

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,599
me teaching i'm also learning so i would

82
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,720
love to

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,440
discuss with you online or offline and

84
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,799
we can learn together

85
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,799
and i would highly recommend that you

86
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,080
take notes

87
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,239
for some of the materials that we show

88
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,599
here even though this is

89
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,799
recorded we

90
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,120
i want to encourage this reinforcement

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,400
learning for

92
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,239
natural intelligence which means um

93
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,560
there will be materials that you will

94
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
recall constantly

95
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,439
we may have covered some content

96
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,640
a few days before and now we are looking

97
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,799
at it again from a different angle

98
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,840
and that will also provide me feedback

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
so feel free to ask questions during

100
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,920
this class

101
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,680
and if you like to type your questions

102
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,319
in the chat feel free to do that selfie

103
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,040
is monitoring and

104
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,440
you can also unmute yourself to ask

105
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,399
questions as

106
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,820
we discuss

107
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,800
[Music]

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,639
and if there's anything that is

109
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,919
confusing

110
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,360
you know in any way uh just ask just

111
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,199
raise the question i cannot see you

112
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,199
right now that i'm sharing my screen

113
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,360
but um sophie is monitoring the chat and

114
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,639
she can let me know

115
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,000
if you are asking questions there and i

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,520
can try to explain

117
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,240
that in a different way so

118
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,520
let's just take a few step back to look

119
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,560
at

120
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,880
how computing has been developed to

121
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,320
where we are and right now is a perfect

122
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
timing to start

123
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,440
learning about quantum computing so we

124
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,400
we are all very familiar with the

125
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,280
technologies that rely on computing

126
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,600
is pretty much everywhere so all of our

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,720
world functions rely on connectivity and

128
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,840
technologies

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,280
a lot of our problems we

130
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,320
represented on the computer and

131
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,199
we sent it online through the data

132
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,080
centers

133
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,680
and that could connect to some other

134
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,560
part of the world

135
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,320
but there are still some problems that

136
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,759
our most powerful computers do run into

137
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
limitations even our super computers and

138
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,840
hyper

139
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,039
high performance computing clusters

140
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,320
are not capable of solving some of the

141
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,600
most challenging problems those problems

142
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,400
include a lot of things that relies

143
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,479
on the fundamental behaviors of nature

144
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,840
things like chemical simulations

145
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,280
or discovery of new materials

146
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,319
those fundamentally are quantum

147
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,360
mechanical

148
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,680
that's the interactions between

149
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,720
molecules

150
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
and fundamental particles that are so

151
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
small and they work in a quantum

152
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,720
mechanical way

153
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,479
our classical computers may run into

154
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,520
limitations when we're trying to capture

155
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,160
the behaviors of those systems

156
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,199
and there are also problems such as

157
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,240
logistics or signal processing

158
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,840
or security that fundamentally they are

159
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,680
classical but with

160
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,080
our advancement in quantum algorithms

161
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,680
they can also help solve some problems

162
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
in those areas even though

163
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,400
they may not be themselves quantum

164
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,080
mechanical

165
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,759
so the uh i would later on

166
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,160
dive into more of the specific

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,599
applications

168
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,120
and also we have at microsoft developed

169
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,400
a lot of

170
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,360
libraries that solves that provide

171
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,560
solutions to some of these industries

172
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
there are blocks you can read over there

173
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
and they're also

174
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,680
called samples that you can download and

175
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,080
try

176
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,039
running those examples yourself on your

177
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,479
own computer

178
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,639
so generally speaking

179
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,520
there are several application areas so

180
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,800
quantum simulation

181
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,319
to me is the most interesting area

182
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,840
because my background is in physics

183
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,280
and our classical computers are not able

184
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,000
to

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,520
simulate all of the quantum systems

186
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,520
so if we can have a computer that is

187
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,300
itself quantum

188
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,680
[Music]

189
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,879
mechanical then they can

190
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,479
be able to simulate the quantum

191
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,360
systems and then there are algorithms

192
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,919
there are

193
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,400
quite a few algorithm that's developed

194
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
since the 80s

195
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,360
that can lead to very exciting

196
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
applications

197
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,360
and there is also cryptography that

198
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,960
quantum computer can

199
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,080
bring solutions to

200
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,679
a lot of most of the modern cryptography

201
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,919
relies on rsa which is factorization of

202
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,880
huge numbers

203
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,919
that could take a reasonably long time

204
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,360
for a supercomputer to

205
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,800
to figure out but then if quantum

206
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,440
algorithm comes in it can break the

207
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,480
current ions

208
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,160
a method which is

209
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,360
terrible a lot of banks and

210
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,680
governments are looking into that in

211
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,880
order to prevent such

212
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,720
change uh criminal act um but

213
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,920
at the same time if we can have a

214
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
quantum computer generating new types of

215
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,120
cryptography

216
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,120
methods that's even better

217
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,800
um i would say that quantum computer

218
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,839
is like the other biomimicking

219
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,959
tools so obviously the

220
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,600
these pictures here i show are kind of

221
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,200
easy to see that we

222
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,959
learned we were inspired by animals to

223
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,480
build tools but then we can

224
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,880
also be inspired by nature the most

225
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,000
small building blocks of nature

226
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,519
to build computers so this course would

227
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,880
um we will start looking into the

228
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,160
fundamental

229
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,680
basics of how quantum computing works

230
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560
and i would just i would not over load

231
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,959
you with information so that's why we

232
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,240
only have 30 minutes and would just

233
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,760
talk about one topic

234
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,120
per week and throughout the week you can

235
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,079
let me know what you want me to draw and

236
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,240
you can look at the comics to

237
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,680
see what's coming up next so quang

238
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,079
computers could help us solve some of

239
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,200
the problems

240
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,720
that current computers cannot

241
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,680
do efficiently

242
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,440
but what is what is it

243
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,160
on a high level it is based on the laws

244
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,560
of quantum mechanics

245
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,640
is a computation based on that

246
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,360
it has a relatively pretty short history

247
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,680
it developed really really fast

248
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,519
so here is what i wanted to show that

249
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,040
it has a history

250
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,480
for since since the 80s when

251
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,000
it was first proposed by men and

252
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,040
feymen that we could create

253
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,079
some machines that's based on the laws

254
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,680
of quantum mechanics

255
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,760
and that could be that could help us

256
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,959
build simulation tools to

257
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,079
mimic quantum mechanical systems and

258
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:30,720
then

259
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,320
from there we had quite a few

260
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,959
algorithms developed and they are all

261
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,959
based on each other

262
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,720
so there were the first proposed

263
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,760
quantum turing machine by david deutsch

264
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,040
and then peter shore came up with a

265
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,079
algorithm for factoring and

266
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,360
groover then produced a algorithm

267
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,079
for quantum search and there are more

268
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:00,720
and

269
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,639
most of the later on later algorithm

270
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,959
relate to some of these existing ones

271
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,160
and those algorithms could be limiting

272
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,760
themselves but then they

273
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,880
show that they could solve certain

274
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,720
problems that's more efficient than

275
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,839
classical

276
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,279
computers classical algorithms and then

277
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,000
since then we all know that in the past

278
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,360
couple years

279
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,600
all these big companies have jumped onto

280
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,639
the subjects

281
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,839
so google ibm microsoft intel

282
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,720
are all working on and a lot more big

283
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,800
companies and startups

284
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
working on both the hardware and

285
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
software development of this

286
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,839
so we are in a very exciting time that

287
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,760
this emerging technology

288
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
is growing into an industry so and it's

289
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,480
also perfect time for us

290
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,519
to get into it before it's too late to

291
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,480
really

292
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,440
try to demystify a lot of the things

293
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,160
that

294
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,240
we hear all the time from media

295
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,620
so we know that our

296
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,560
[Music]

297
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,079
classical computing is based on the

298
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,680
binary systems

299
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,240
and the modern computers are made of

300
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
transistors

301
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,639
to represent zeros and ones

302
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,920
quantum computers are fundamentally

303
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,160
different

304
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,120
so classically we can

305
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,720
describe a system using

306
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,920
bits and notes

307
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,120
this definition of states

308
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,279
is you can imagine it as a

309
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,079
status or condition of your system so

310
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,560
say

311
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,760
if your light is on or off then you can

312
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,399
represent it as zero or one or one or

313
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,480
zero

314
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
say your temperature is too high or too

315
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,360
low that could also be represented as

316
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,800
one or zero or if you flip a coin

317
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,440
the the hat and the tail could be one or

318
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,000
zero

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,320
so all these metaphors that i chose are

320
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,120
like

321
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,279
um conveniently binary

322
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,160
and mathematically we can also just

323
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,720
write it

324
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,839
out as vectors

325
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,720
so zero would be is in the

326
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,320
two-dimensional space

327
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,360
and there are only two possible ways to

328
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,800
represent

329
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,600
the the classical bits zero and one so

330
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,880
zero we can

331
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,720
uh just write one zero and one as

332
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
zero one there are only these two

333
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,320
possibilities

334
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,760
for a basis of two

335
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,399
and if you have more classical bits

336
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,320
you can just write it out

337
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,440
as a combination of two

338
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,279
bits and the mathematics that's used

339
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,000
here

340
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,040
is called a tensor product i've written

341
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,760
out here

342
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,639
how tensor product works this is

343
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,760
basically how you

344
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,120
[Music]

345
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,839
put two vectors together and then try to

346
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,360
calculate

347
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,680
the result of their tensor problem so

348
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,959
the first one times

349
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,360
these two the second one times these two

350
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
so you can walk through the math

351
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,600
later that's that's not critical right

352
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,480
now

353
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,519
but using vector would make the

354
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,560
representation

355
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,880
very easy later on as we get

356
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,839
more into it but

357
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
simply looking at this you can also see

358
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,680
that

359
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,800
if we have two qubits then that's

360
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,600
four possible configurations four

361
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,120
possible ways to represent the two

362
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,519
bits zero zero zero one one zero one one

363
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
there's no other possibilities

364
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,320
it turns out you can write it out if you

365
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,040
do the math

366
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,920
you'll get this 1 by 4 vector

367
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,759
but even without doing this tensor

368
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,079
product you can see these are the four

369
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,120
possible ways to arrange the numbers

370
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,600
zero zero you will have the one starting

371
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
at the first element

372
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,519
and the second one will have the one

373
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,440
here the third one we have the one

374
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,720
third fourth one will have one at the

375
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,079
bottom so that's

376
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,720
that's a four dimensional it's called

377
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,240
huber space

378
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,720
but don't worry about these terms we'll

379
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,399
just get more intuition

380
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,920
and we know that classical computers are

381
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,399
built

382
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,279
on transistors that will represent zero

383
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,800
one and how

384
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,519
transistors work i won't go into details

385
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,000
but

386
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,399
it's basically a semiconductor sandwich

387
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,320
you can have the electrons

388
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,039
to go through your material or not based

389
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:05,439
on

390
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,640
the voltage you apply to the material if

391
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,160
you let

392
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,439
say let's the voltage electricity go

393
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,959
through you can

394
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,280
say that it's one if you don't let it go

395
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,400
through you

396
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,039
label it as zero so that's how bits

397
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,199
classical bits are physically

398
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,400
made in computers

399
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,240
um so i'm using quite a lot of analogies

400
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,400
here and quantum computing

401
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,520
is a more

402
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,559
correct way to describe nature i would

403
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,679
say

404
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,600
so it functions completely differently

405
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,760
from this binary way of representing

406
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,200
information

407
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,720
so a switch like binary building block

408
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,520
is 0 1 a much more simplified

409
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,280
version of how nature behaves

410
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,320
nature which is made of the

411
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,920
fundamental particles

412
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,400
[Music]

413
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,840
and the quantum mechanical particles

414
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,559
like

415
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,720
electrons photons atoms etc

416
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,640
they have energy states so everything is

417
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,400
built on top of these things

418
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,160
so at the very low level they have the

419
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,640
energy states that are in superposition

420
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,919
so it's not zero or one but

421
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,520
different states in

422
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,679
a coexisting manner

423
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,799
so i'm gonna explain a bit about

424
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,840
what superposition is and that is the

425
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,720
fundamental

426
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,280
uh behavior

427
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,160
for a quantum computing computer

428
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,360
so classical bits again uh you have

429
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,559
zero and one that you can

430
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,559
make all kinds of matter first to say

431
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,039
that so if i have a circle if it's

432
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,559
empty we can label it as zero

433
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,720
if it's filled it is a one

434
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,760
for a quantum bit shorthand

435
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,960
qubit it can have

436
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,000
it can represent zero and one

437
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,559
in a single qubit so here you can say

438
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,760
we have one third of the state zero

439
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,600
and two thirds of one in it

440
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,559
another metaphor you can say we have

441
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,840
some lottery thing

442
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,880
and uh if we have 20 balls

443
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,919
if they're all red zero or blue they're

444
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,360
one

445
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
but then if you mix it up we can have

446
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,720
arbitrary numbers here

447
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,080
so say uh eight over twenty is zero

448
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,159
and twelve over twenty is one you can

449
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,559
you can change any number here

450
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,039
uh and then a coin you can also say a

451
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,919
head is zero a tail is one

452
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,240
if it's an even coin if you rotate it

453
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,360
you know that there's

454
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,960
fifty percent chance of landing on zero

455
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,400
and fifty percent of linear one so you

456
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,039
see that

457
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,320
here the quantum bits

458
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,240
qubits is related to

459
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,440
the probabilities of the

460
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,720
amount of information in there

461
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,080
so a

462
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,360
spinning coin is a metaphor for

463
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,400
head and tail in superposition

464
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,360
again representative mathematically i

465
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,200
hope you made notes earlier

466
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,320
to write down what zero and ones are

467
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,679
so a state we can state for

468
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,960
a qubit we can again represent

469
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
with a vector but now

470
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,559
instead of just zeros and ones in the

471
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,679
vector

472
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,360
we can have amplitudes we can have

473
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,120
any number a or b if you split it up you

474
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,280
will see that is

475
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,320
a amount of zero plus b amount of one

476
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,520
so that is to say that a quantum

477
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,440
qubit is a state that is

478
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,679
that is a superposition between zero and

479
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,880
one

480
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,760
and or another term is linear

481
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,720
combination

482
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,919
of these two possible states and they

483
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,039
each have has a weight

484
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,159
in front of them so a

485
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,760
and b tells you how much of 0 and 1

486
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,880
is in your whole system the only

487
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,760
requirement

488
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,120
for them is that their

489
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,520
amplitudes squared sum to one

490
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,840
what does that mean so in our earlier

491
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,360
example

492
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,640
a circle with one third of zero and

493
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,159
two-thirds three

494
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,679
is basically saying that the probability

495
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,000
of

496
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,080
finding the circle in zero is one third

497
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,039
the probability of finding the circle in

498
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,840
the black

499
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,120
one is two thirds so

500
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,880
a squared and b squared are

501
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,480
probabilities

502
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,400
of how how much of those

503
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,440
possible outcomes you can get so

504
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,679
similarly with the other two metaphors

505
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,880
you can write it out

506
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,120
so common sense

507
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,600
when we have a complete system all of

508
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,720
the possible

509
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,000
probabilities will add up to one so

510
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,320
there's nothing more to that this is

511
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,600
called a normalization

512
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,480
condition so this is a

513
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,919
simple way to represent a qubit

514
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,120
it is a linear combination

515
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,200
of two possible states

516
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,640
if you have multiple qubits

517
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,280
you can do the same thing like before to

518
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,600
have a tensor product between

519
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,000
different qubits so if you have two

520
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,039
qubits

521
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,919
you do this tensor product again you get

522
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,200
four different amplitudes

523
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,919
and again the amplitudes are the

524
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,880
coefficients

525
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,360
to tell you how much of these four

526
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,000
possible

527
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,159
states four possible configuration

528
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,480
that's in your system

529
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,400
and you get the probabilities

530
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,679
of each atom up they should be one

531
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,840
that's the only requirement for

532
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,279
this to work

533
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,240
so that is a qubit that is different

534
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,720
from a classical bit that is just 0 and

535
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,520
1.

536
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,880
a qubit is a state

537
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
with superposition of all the

538
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,520
possibilities

539
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,440
and i think i will stop here for today

540
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,400
we'll talk a bit more of the

541
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
significance of this

542
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,520
why we use superposition and what what

543
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,799
does this lead to

544
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,600
and give you a bit more intuition of the

545
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,919
concepts later on

546
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,400
i hope this helps let's see if anyone

547
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:38,720
has questions feel free to ask
