[Music]

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,440
welcome everyone

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,639
welcome back and also welcome newcomers

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,720
uh today is the sixth session of

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,840
the quantum computing class on hackaday

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,199
and i'm recording this the

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,920
past videos you can find in the

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,960
hackaday project the link

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,399
here shows the comics

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,800
and recording and the slides

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,399
every wednesday and sunday i post some

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,600
new comics for the week

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,000
on my social media and the hackaday

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,920
project so if you missed anything you

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,280
can always go back

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,440
so just for newcomers who are not

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,039
familiar with the format

18
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,079
we spend 30 minutes on sunday like right

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,879
now

20
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,840
discussing one concept we previously

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,319
have covered quite a lot of

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,439
basic concepts and software how do you

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,240
program

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,240
and how to write the q sharp language

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,360
to use quantum computers so today is

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,840
very exciting i know a lot of people

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,119
ask me to talk a bit about hardware

28
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,200
and we're gonna we're gonna do an

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,520
overview of all kinds of hardware

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,759
so in terms of hardware i wouldn't claim

31
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,880
that i'm

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,079
expert in any of the types of hardware

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,119
that i'm going to show

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,040
today because i don't

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,759
any more work on the hardware hands-on

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,040
directly

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,000
i used to work on similar systems but

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,799
they were not

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,399
for quantum computing so it's codes

40
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,240
low temperature physics and condensed

41
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,399
metaphysics so

42
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,520
if anyone in the audience works on

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,200
any specific hardware system

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,640
in the lab i would love to have you on

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,600
this

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,520
and share your knowledge in particular

47
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,679
hardware system so no one can really

48
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,720
claim that they

49
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,280
know everything about all kinds of

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,560
quantum hardware

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,520
no one but then they can be very

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,319
specialized

53
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,360
in certain types so if

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,040
any of you work on this as your day job

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,720
please let me know

56
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
so today we're gonna give a brief

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,440
overview to give you an idea of

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,760
the different types of things we can try

59
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,160
in terms of making computing hardware

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,120
we already are using our electronics

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
every day

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,519
computers and phones

63
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,160
they're based on transistors from

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,440
probably the first

65
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,160
session i've already mentioned that

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,440
transistors are

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,360
like very tiny switches

68
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,120
you can make them out of semiconductors

69
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,599
and

70
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,239
layers of semiconductor insulators and

71
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,760
metals

72
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,120
you can form in the material areas

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,440
where you can control the doping the

74
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,959
elec

75
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,159
electronic concentration in different

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,440
areas

77
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,040
by applying certain gates you can allow

78
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,000
electrical current to go

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,319
through from source to drain or you can

80
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,360
stop it

81
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,239
so this can give you a on and off so

82
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,640
that's how in transitions we make zero

83
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,920
and ones

84
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,120
for qubits we already know that

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,080
we are only dealing with zero and one

86
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,440
and we need to make them into

87
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,640
superposition

88
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,440
so all you need is some system that

89
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,879
provides

90
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,239
two types of states and you can put them

91
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,239
in superposition

92
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,599
naturally we want to use

93
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,920
something that already exists that

94
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,040
already

95
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,080
gives us two levels that we can use

96
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,200
as zero and ones one of the candidates

97
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,080
is electrons that's the simplest the

98
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,799
purest

99
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,400
we naturally exist we could

100
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
look at using but then

101
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,839
how think about how small electrons are

102
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,358
and they're everywhere

103
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,720
how do we isolate them and control the

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,280
electrons to do what we want

105
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,440
we need to form certain

106
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,520
structure to contain electrons but

107
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,360
before i go there i want to

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,919
just briefly mention this concept about

109
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,759
electron spin

110
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,040
this is discovered

111
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,840
a long time ago when quantum mechanics

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,400
just

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,080
became a new field of study

114
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,199
the stern and garlic

115
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,240
they feel the experiment

116
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,759
to shoot a beam of electrons through

117
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,880
a magnetic field back then they didn't

118
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,360
know

119
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
about the concept of spin and they

120
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,680
were just trying to to see

121
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,919
what they would observe when the

122
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,440
electron beam goes through

123
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,039
the magnetic field uh without knowing

124
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,280
the existence of spain they would think

125
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,560
oh electron is

126
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,919
negatively charged and then through a

127
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,520
magnetic field it would

128
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,639
deflect in to one direction

129
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,400
to their surprise they observed two

130
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,320
beams merging out of the electrical

131
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,600
field and there must be something some

132
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,759
physical parameter that they were not

133
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,520
accounting for

134
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,600
and turned out it was the the spin

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,919
that's how spin was discovered

136
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,440
so eli electrons and

137
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,919
all kinds of fundamental particles have

138
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,479
spin

139
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,680
electron has one of the simplest is

140
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,400
just spin up or spin down and this is

141
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,360
just

142
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,039
i don't want to confuse people who

143
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,039
haven't ever seen this before but for

144
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:03,919
physicists

145
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,919
in the room they

146
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,520
use this spatial representation

147
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,400
to show a parameter of spin

148
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,160
so we could use this spin up and down

149
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,560
as the zero and ones

150
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,520
so how do we confine electrons into

151
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,120
controllable format there's a lot of

152
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,319
engineering

153
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,520
material we can artificially create

154
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,319
materials

155
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,600
to confine electrons the way

156
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,319
we want so we can actually constrain

157
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,800
electrons into different dimensions

158
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
in bulk materials that will naturally

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,720
exist

160
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,000
in 3d electrons orders inside

161
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,599
the materials and they

162
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,599
can conduct electricity they can flow

163
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,280
around

164
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,800
but in some materials we can make them

165
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,240
into 2d

166
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,440
so electrons will be confined into only

167
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,479
this lateral direction we can even

168
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,360
further

169
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,639
confine them into 1d that's like in

170
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,160
another wire

171
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,360
and then we can and can further trap

172
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,000
them

173
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,720
into 0d so this is like artificially

174
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,360
trapped

175
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,639
and this is what we can create

176
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,919
like a quantum dot so

177
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,080
how do we create a quantum dot in order

178
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,360
to trap

179
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,120
electrons into 0d and in that case

180
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,199
also to isolate electrons

181
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,680
so that we can manipulate them this is

182
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,280
typical

183
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,080
structure using alumina gallium arsenide

184
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,319
and

185
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,000
gallius night two similar semiconductors

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,520
but they differ by this dopant

187
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,360
alloy here at the interface

188
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,560
they can form this two-dimensional

189
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,080
sheet of electron so for people who

190
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,400
have learned solid-state physics this is

191
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,319
the 2d electron gas

192
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,680
2 deck you can further

193
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,160
apply metal gates on top of the

194
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,520
materials

195
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,199
and apply electrical current

196
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,240
voltage this potential

197
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
here would remove some of the electrons

198
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,639
underneath

199
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,839
the gate this is called a depletion

200
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,000
region where electrons are depleted from

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,919
the 2d electron gas

202
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,760
then what's left with is this region

203
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,640
that you can gradually remove more and

204
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,720
more electrons until you just have

205
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,160
one electron kept in this little region

206
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,480
here

207
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,279
this is called a quantum dot so that's

208
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,480
you know way

209
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,760
reducing the dimensionality of how

210
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,600
electrons can sit in the material

211
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,800
and then create this zero d uh

212
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,160
structure where you can trap a electron

213
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,120
here

214
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
and you can measure the spin and you can

215
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,640
apply voltage

216
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,760
or electromagnetic field to

217
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,279
change its spin

218
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,080
then in this way you can create a row of

219
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,839
electrons you can create multiple of

220
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,680
them and then

221
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,120
control each of them to

222
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,920
build this

223
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,959
correlation and entanglement between

224
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,120
them but this is very very difficult

225
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,360
you have to really be able to manipulate

226
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,480
electrons at an individual level

227
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,200
so a lot of research has been done

228
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
that's one way of doing that but a lot

229
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,560
of

230
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,080
current work on 2d

231
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,440
sorry on the quantum dot electron for

232
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,320
qubits applications is still being done

233
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,839
in research

234
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,760
and there are other ways to

235
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,120
trap electrons such as using

236
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,560
the crystal lattice

237
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,760
instead of in semiconductors and

238
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,519
building the reducing dimensionalities

239
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,120
one by one

240
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,000
we can also use naturally formed

241
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
crystals like

242
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,839
diamonds or maybe not naturally we can

243
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,800
also grow

244
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,360
diamonds in the labs and you can

245
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,160
carefully

246
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,200
remove two

247
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,720
carbons inside this lattice have

248
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,760
a vacancy and a nitrogen

249
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,399
replacing one of the carbon because

250
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,440
nitrogen has

251
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,640
one more electron than

252
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,640
carbon has you can have this electron

253
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,399
trapped here in this nitrogen vacancy

254
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,160
region and you can then apply

255
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,839
um light microwave to manipulate the

256
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,240
electron there

257
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,839
um that's using electrons and it's

258
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,839
you can think that it's pretty difficult

259
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
to do that controllably

260
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,880
like in the diamond vacancy is

261
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,959
essentially using the defects inside

262
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,000
your material

263
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,120
and sometimes it's very hard to

264
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,440
even control where your defect will form

265
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,560
you have to grow your

266
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,279
your diamond very carefully so

267
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,600
scalability is very difficult

268
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,079
but there there is not limited to use

269
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,640
electron there are other

270
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,480
particles we could use such as irons

271
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,240
irons are ionized

272
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
atoms so atoms are neutral but irons you

273
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,200
can form them by

274
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,839
removing an electron adding electron and

275
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,360
having

276
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,720
this charge on the irons and it

277
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,519
itself would carry a spin as well

278
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,200
you could think about it as a spain

279
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,880
for iron that you're using but in fact

280
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,440
is

281
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,040
more complex so when you have iron

282
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,399
you would

283
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,370
you would be able to

284
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,680
[Music]

285
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,959
measure the electron levels

286
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,519
inside the iron but because of the

287
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,200
existence of spin

288
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,760
your energy levels could split

289
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
this is called a fine structure if

290
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,959
you're not familiar with the term don't

291
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,560
worry about it it's just

292
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,680
when there's spin uh

293
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,440
if of the electrons in the iron energy

294
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,160
level it

295
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,480
would split further into more levels

296
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,279
and and then there's also another

297
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,399
splitting called

298
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,079
hyperfine structure is caused by the

299
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,680
interaction between electrons and their

300
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,200
nucleus

301
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,320
and don't worry if this is uh not

302
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,279
the most familiar concept for you but

303
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,519
just

304
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,279
take it that inside irons you will have

305
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,959
a energy structure where

306
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,639
electrons of the irons could sit onto

307
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,839
and you could use two of the levels

308
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,279
inside the irons

309
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,079
to be your zero and one states it could

310
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,839
be from the fine structure or it could

311
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,839
be from the high profile structure

312
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,920
as long as you know what you what you're

313
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,040
doing and

314
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,399
you know which levels you're controlling

315
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,040
so people have built all kinds of

316
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,920
electron

317
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,440
iron traps these are

318
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,480
electrodes where you can form a

319
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,279
electromagnetic field and you can trap

320
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,600
the irons into a row

321
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,839
then you can apply laser beams to

322
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
manipulate each individual irons

323
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,600
trapped inside and

324
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,360
in the cartoon view they each have their

325
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,160
own spin

326
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,760
and you can change the iron spin

327
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,040
by using a focused laser beam

328
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,720
so that's how you can use irons

329
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,760
to use their spins as the

330
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,920
the the qubit and that's based on the

331
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,079
two of the levels from their electronic

332
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,800
structure so trap irons have

333
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,680
also quite a long history is built in

334
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,399
the labs

335
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,839
it had a very complex optical

336
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,959
setup you have to have vacuum

337
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,800
tubes to trap the irons and use

338
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,600
a lot of laser beams to manipulate them

339
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,160
so for

340
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,800
a while it was thought that is very

341
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,240
difficult to scale

342
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,440
given see how complex this setup

343
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,800
is and you have to have a lot of lasers

344
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,160
but recently just in the past couple

345
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,639
years

346
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,920
there were a lot of effort and in the

347
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,120
industry that

348
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,160
really started to scale these

349
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,760
things down in terms of complexity and

350
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,199
size now you can build chip

351
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,720
structures that have iron traps or

352
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,800
built on chip this is a picture from

353
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,000
honeywell's on-chip iron trap which is

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,959
really cool

355
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,720
and they are actually a partner with

356
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
microsoft that

357
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,720
we could use q-sharp to program

358
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,959
the irons on these chips

359
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,399
so that's for the iron traps

360
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,759
since electrons and irons are both using

361
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,440
energy levels

362
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,639
we could also try to make

363
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,720
artificial atoms electrons and irons are

364
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,639
natural particles but we could also

365
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,680
mimic it in a

366
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,720
circuit so

367
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,160
we could build a oscillating circuit

368
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,440
using a superconducting

369
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,560
component called joseph's junction and a

370
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,480
capacitor

371
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,639
and then form this circuit on chip

372
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,759
it because the josephson junction is

373
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,360
a special type of inductor so if you

374
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,320
are familiar with lc circuits what what

375
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,199
does it do

376
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,560
which it basically forms a oscillating

377
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,480
energy signal yeah

378
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,440
just a quick um some quick pictures to

379
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,320
show you

380
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,680
there uh all kinds of architecture that

381
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,440
you can build on chip

382
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,720
making those lc circuits

383
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,480
and so if you're familiar with the lc

384
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,880
circuit you would know that

385
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,720
its energy versus frequency would be

386
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,799
like a harmonic oscillator shape

387
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,400
when you reduce it to a really low

388
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,119
temperature

389
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,000
and make it very very small it then

390
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,359
enters the quantum regime

391
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,720
when this circuit becomes a quantum

392
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,679
circuit

393
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,039
it would just split into discrete energy

394
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,520
levels

395
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,200
so you could use those levels as their

396
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
zeros and ones

397
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,720
but then in the case of a lc circuit a

398
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,080
normal

399
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,440
inductor all these splitting would be

400
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,480
the same width

401
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,360
which means when you apply a certain

402
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,440
energy to your system

403
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,480
you wouldn't be able to control if is

404
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,960
your system is exchanging between these

405
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,679
two levels

406
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,720
or exchanging between these two levels

407
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,840
so a normal lc circuit is not that

408
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,080
useful

409
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,200
then what people did was to replace this

410
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,400
inductor with the joseph's injunction

411
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,520
and what it does is it modifies

412
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,960
is oscillating profile

413
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,240
to be uneven so you still

414
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,320
when it's in the quantum regime you get

415
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,840
these splitted

416
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,360
discrete energy levels but then the

417
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,880
spacing

418
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,400
is different between each two levels

419
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,360
then you can control which two levels

420
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,039
you you want to use

421
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,440
so you can pick the ground state as your

422
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,400
zero and then

423
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,520
excited state as one and you can

424
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,720
apply a electromagnetic field to

425
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,240
exchange between these two so this is

426
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,280
the basic working principle

427
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,799
of the superconducting circuit

428
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,880
and how to use it as a qubit system

429
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,160
and i want to point to this here that

430
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,120
i showed a

431
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,000
swing and is saying that if we were

432
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,360
small and cold enough then we could be

433
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,840
qubits and what does that mean i just

434
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,600
because i showed that earlier

435
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,840
the lc circuits we could have a

436
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,039
classical case

437
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,320
and we could have a quantum case how

438
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,679
at what criteria

439
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,039
can als circuits change from

440
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,480
classical to quantum there are a

441
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,600
few things we need to do one is to make

442
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,559
them very small

443
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,360
and how small basically the effective

444
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:53,760
length

445
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,080
of the circuit needs to be smaller than

446
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,240
the electron scattering length

447
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,280
because your system is all full of

448
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,240
electrons and they scatter and you rely

449
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,760
on the electrical

450
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,159
field your electricity to

451
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,120
oscillate in your circuit then you want

452
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,720
to make sure that it is

453
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,480
small enough that it wouldn't be

454
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,600
broken apart by the scattering of

455
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,960
electrons and you have to make the

456
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,159
temperature

457
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,600
low enough and there's the equation to

458
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,720
let you figure out how low is low it

459
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,840
depends on your oscillating

460
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,280
frequency that is your natural frequency

461
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,640
of the circuit

462
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,159
and is calculated from your capacitance

463
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,840
and inductance and then the temperature

464
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,400
is

465
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,440
uh k is the boltzmann constant and you

466
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,200
just need to make sure that

467
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,400
your temperature is lower than the

468
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,240
um h bar times omega so

469
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,440
typically we have a lot of

470
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,039
these superconducting circuits or any

471
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,440
quantum circuits that needs to be cooled

472
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,480
down

473
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,520
below liquid helium temperature and i

474
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,360
will show more about this

475
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,880
in a bit so this is

476
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,520
what people use the dilution

477
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,679
refrigerator

478
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,440
is got this very complicated

479
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,280
structure and it has many many stages of

480
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,320
electronics

481
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,280
but your your qubit is sitting inside

482
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
the very bottom

483
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,480
and this is what people use to cool

484
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,960
things down to really low temperature

485
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,159
really no low

486
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,679
in order to get your system into

487
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,360
quantum regime and

488
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,679
i'm showing some pictures from ibm and

489
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,799
also microsoft

490
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,320
and you also have to have really precise

491
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,960
well-designed control system to make

492
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,159
sure that

493
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,679
your temperature

494
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,480
and your rest of the circuit is not

495
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,919
messing up with your

496
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,200
little qubit at the very bottom and then

497
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,919
you you

498
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,520
emerge sit in a liquid

499
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,320
helium nitrogen dior

500
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,320
this is a cartoon showing how the

501
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,480
setup looks like when you immerse the

502
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,039
electronics into those

503
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,960
liquids helium and nitrogen and

504
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,559
first nitrogen is at the temperature of

505
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,240
77k liquid nitrogen naturally

506
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,559
so you can cool things down by immersing

507
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,840
it into

508
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,200
liquid nitrogen to 77k and then further

509
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,640
down into liquid helium

510
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,760
which is naturally at 4.2 k

511
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,080
and then you can further pump your

512
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,679
system

513
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,360
to get to a vacuum and there

514
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,400
can also be phase transitions inside

515
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,520
your system and then you eventually can

516
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
cool things down to

517
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,039
like millikelvin temperature

518
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,320
and here again to reinforce

519
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,039
what i mentioned about temperature is

520
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,000
when

521
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,960
you have any temperature your system

522
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,720
the atoms and electrons

523
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,080
are absorbing that energy and they would

524
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,799
vibrate at jitter so temperature is

525
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,200
really our enemy when it comes to

526
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,000
quantum studies because it's

527
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,080
producing noise we want to get rid of

528
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,799
the noise

529
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,799
that's why we are cooling things down to

530
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,159
so low so

531
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,360
all these electron scatterings and

532
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,480
the vibration in the lattice will be

533
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,520
reduced

534
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,799
and then we can look at the pure quantum

535
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,960
behavior of your material

536
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,120
that's why for some of these systems we

537
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,799
have to cool them down to really low

538
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,000
temperatures

539
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,520
superconducting circ quantum

540
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,559
computer and also the topological

541
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,679
quantum computer we

542
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,880
also need to cool it down

543
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,200
so that was using

544
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,039
artificial atoms to

545
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,559
make quan to make qubits

546
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,320
but we could also be more creative

547
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,520
and imaginative to not use uh

548
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,960
energy levels as our zeros and ones

549
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,400
but we can use

550
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,039
other types of particles or quasi

551
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,200
particles which are

552
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,799
similar to natural particles but because

553
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,480
of the interactions between many of them

554
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,480
they have formed their own behaviors and

555
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,080
that kind of collective behavior

556
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,360
or we call them quasi particles

557
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,240
so one example of using

558
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,880
other parameters then energy level is

559
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,480
using photons

560
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,720
there are photonics chips built that

561
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,480
would

562
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,240
guide your photons on chip

563
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,360
and you can manipulate

564
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,400
its polarization

565
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,840
and we could encode the

566
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,120
qubit states into different

567
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,520
polarizations so here are just some

568
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,880
cartoons to show you

569
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,159
generally you could say

570
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,159
when you have a vertical polarization

571
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,080
that's my zero state

572
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
if i have a lateral polarization that's

573
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,320
my one state

574
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,679
you could use photons this way

575
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,039
to form your two qubits and

576
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,960
microsoft in particular is pursuing

577
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,279
something completely different is using

578
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,720
a quasi-particle called majorana

579
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,320
zero modes and they can be formed

580
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,400
on a

581
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,279
stack of different types of materials

582
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:21,600
and

583
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,640
at their interfaces and defects you can

584
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,760
you could create them so what

585
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,440
we ended up using is nanowire

586
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,960
on top of superconductors and at the

587
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,000
very ends of the nanowires you could

588
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,360
create those zero modes and the zero

589
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:41,840
modes

590
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,960
are the locations where electrons

591
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,480
could occupy or not occupy so leaving

592
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,360
them empty

593
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,400
so you could assign those two states

594
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,679
as 0 and 1.

595
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,799
this is very interesting compared to

596
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,760
the previous examples where you rely on

597
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,480
the

598
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,520
individual electrons or ions

599
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,159
to behave as your qubits and it's very

600
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,039
prone to

601
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,399
your environmental entanglement

602
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,360
you could very easily uh

603
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,039
you could very easily i think

604
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,840
this is not very quantified way of

605
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,039
saying that but

606
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,200
a lot of previous ways of

607
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,240
making a qubit can be error prone

608
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,320
but this topological way is to

609
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,159
use global parameters instead of

610
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,200
local parameters like your electron spin

611
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,000
or where your electron is

612
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,120
but then to look at the global behavior

613
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,279
of your whole system such as conductance

614
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,399
in your nanowire you you could have this

615
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,760
oscillating behavior exchanging between

616
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,440
uh zero and one if uh you

617
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,559
apply different magnetic flux so you

618
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,520
could assign

619
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,360
that um when your electrons are not

620
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,320
filling up

621
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,919
the zero modes that's zero and if it is

622
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:22,640
filling it up

623
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,679
that's a one so i'm i've drawn this

624
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,720
mysterious

625
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,600
trains here i this is trying to show

626
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,840
that

627
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,799
if you take this particular magnetic

628
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,679
field flux

629
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,760
as the point you want to observe

630
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,720
it has a say a maximum value

631
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,480
of conductance given by the one state

632
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,000
and the conductance is from

633
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,240
the electrons flowing through the

634
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,520
nanowire

635
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,960
and just imagine the case where you have

636
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,159
a train it needs two conductors

637
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,159
to sit on each end of the train

638
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,960
when they are there the train moves so

639
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,159
your conductance is

640
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,480
maximum but if you don't have the

641
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,880
conductors the train is stationary so

642
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,720
you have a zero conductance here

643
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,080
so this is just to use the metaphor

644
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,200
to show that you can have this two

645
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,279
different states

646
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,760
to be your zero and one and you can

647
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,399
exchange between them

648
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,840
some papers about topological quantum

649
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,120
computer from

650
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,159
a while back this is

651
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,720
a picture showing that we are using

652
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,080
nanowires

653
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,120
and you need to

654
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,320
carefully put it onto superconductors to

655
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:50,960
create

656
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,159
such maya under zero modes

657
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,880
and you can measure its existence

658
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,600
through

659
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,880
global parameters like conductance

660
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,039
and i also have some additional cartoons

661
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,799
to show you what is

662
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,960
going on at the lower detail

663
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,159
so theoretically you can

664
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,720
mathematically write out the existence

665
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,559
of the electron

666
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,120
and you could also mathematically write

667
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,600
out that

668
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,840
is it could be a combination

669
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,200
of a symmetric part or

670
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,679
antisymmetric part so you could think

671
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,440
about representing

672
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,960
a electron using the existence of a

673
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,720
major honor pair so it's all a

674
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,520
mathematical construct

675
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
but i'm not showing any math i'm just

676
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,919
turning them into pictures here

677
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,520
and then you can have a row of electrons

678
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,440
sitting next to each other and each pair

679
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,399
is paired within your electrons but then

680
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,279
what happens

681
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,679
when you put them on top of a

682
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,039
superconductor

683
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,480
it could make the pairing

684
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,799
exchange so your adjacent to

685
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,919
symmetrical antisymmetric part can

686
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,880
be paired but then leaving the ends

687
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,519
alone

688
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,960
they're not paired now

689
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,000
imagine you remove all of those

690
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,720
electrons from your system and these

691
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,840
voids are just

692
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,799
the locations where your pairs and

693
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,519
electrons

694
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,720
can sit in then you could have a case

695
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,519
where

696
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,399
you add electrons within but then

697
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,320
leaving those two ends

698
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,159
empty so that would be your zero state

699
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,480
and you could have a case by adding one

700
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,440
electron

701
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,840
you will have those two states occupied

702
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,000
and it doesn't matter where each

703
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,440
electron is

704
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,559
where they sit within the this as long

705
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,600
as

706
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,840
you have the same number of electrons

707
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,679
within

708
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,720
the nanowire except

709
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,919
the ends if you can control that

710
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,399
you can create a topological

711
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,120
qubit so is

712
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,320
quite a lot of content and topological

713
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,360
quantum computer might be the least

714
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,559
conceptually straightforward type so

715
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,360
there are some

716
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,640
papers you can look up i have

717
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,840
used them and some of what i

718
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,600
some of the pictures that i draw were

719
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,039
basically translations

720
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,919
of the maths that were in these papers

721
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,000
so if you're interested you can

722
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,279
look deeper and further into them

723
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,399
um yeah just to wrap up i'm

724
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,559
showing a picture from a 2016 paper this

725
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:50,960
is

726
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,840
a little outdated since the

727
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,919
whole quantum computing field has

728
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,519
uh advanced really rapidly in the past

729
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,320
few years

730
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
but nevertheless i still want to show

731
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
this graph just to show

732
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,519
it's got quite good comparisons between

733
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,159
them

734
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,120
some of the data is outdated and like i

735
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,000
mentioned that

736
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,120
honeywell and inq also use iron trapped

737
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,679
ions

738
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,880
they have created more scalable

739
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,760
solutions

740
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,880
to trapping irons but it's still

741
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,080
got some limitations

742
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,640
i think

743
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,000
not all of these are being used in

744
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,600
industry at a production level

745
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,679
so mostly pursued ones

746
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,399
are like the super conducting circuits

747
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,679
that's being used by google ibm

748
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,600
iron traps honeywell and rnq

749
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,200
there's topological qubits so microsoft

750
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,840
is

751
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,950
doing this type but the other kinds are

752
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,200
[Music]

753
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,679
still there are a lot of research being

754
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,480
done

755
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,560
but the bigger companies that haven't

756
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,199
used these much in their scalable

757
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,480
solutions so

758
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,079
the biggest competitors are these ones

759
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,800
and also this paper did not mention the

760
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,639
photonics quantum computing

761
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,560
is also quite new and it could have some

762
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,000
potential there too

763
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,960
so all of them have their pros and cons

764
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,280
and

765
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,639
we can possibly if people are still

766
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,119
interested we can dive into some of

767
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:39,839
these

768
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,280
to look at details but

769
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,639
in this slides i've showed a lot of

770
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,839
background reading materials you can use

771
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,719
your own time to look out for okay just

772
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,119
to

773
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,239
summarize uh i shouldn't have put this

774
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,440
slide here i should

775
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,160
put this after i want to i want to let

776
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,880
people know that on wednesday

777
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,640
i'm gonna do a new announcement

778
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,980
i'm gonna take a break from

779
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,960
[Music]

780
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,599
making new content but i will still post

781
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,640
something

782
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,640
and that is going to be the certificate

783
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,440
of taking this class because last time

784
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,119
the class asked about

785
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,240
a certificate possibly by attending

786
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,359
these classes

787
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,560
because we are grassroots effort and

788
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,320
we're just doing this for fun

789
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,440
we will have some reward by completing

790
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,280
some tasks to get a certificate

791
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,320
and i will announce it on wednesday is

792
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,599
a personalized drawing

793
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,839
for this class you can put on

794
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,599
your t-shirts or hats or

795
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,119
emerald ping or stickers

796
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,359
whatever you like but what you need to

797
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,680
do is to complete

798
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,520
any quantum katas which i showed in

799
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,960
previous classes

800
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,240
and this slide here that you

801
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,320
definitely need to go take a look at

802
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
quantum context projects

803
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,480
and then they have tutorials and i also

804
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
have explained a lot of concepts that

805
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,079
you can already

806
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,200
do these exercises with

807
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,320
and also if you are keen

808
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,240
to explore things we haven't talked

809
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,160
about you can

810
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,720
try some of the tatas for these topics

811
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,839
so any of these topics you can pick one

812
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:40,400
and

813
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,480
do it when you finish take a screenshot

814
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,520
or set a photo post it on

815
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,280
twitter or linkedin add these accounts

816
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,520
and hashtags you'll get the certificate

817
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,040
uh i'll i'll have more quizzes and

818
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,760
have more certificates you can collect

819
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,160
and

820
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,440
if you volunteer to teach at this class

821
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,640
as an expert in any of the sub

822
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,240
topics we can also have a lecture

823
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,359
certificate so yeah a little over time

824
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,480
today

825
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,200
but if there's any question i can answer

826
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,920
now

827
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,839
i'm gonna stop sharing the screen
