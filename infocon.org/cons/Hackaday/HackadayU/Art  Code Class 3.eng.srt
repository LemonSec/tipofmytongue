2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,760
hey

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,960
uh welcome to week three of rn code you

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,960
made it through the first two weeks

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,480
and now we're kind of on the downhill

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
slope so halfway through

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,320
this week we're going to be exploring

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,400
natural movement which essentially means

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,760
we're going to be looking at sine and

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,480
cosine

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,599
and also purlin noise

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,359
the last two weeks we talked about

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,360
recursion and motion we also talked

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,559
about art composition

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,640
in week two the week before that we

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,320
talked about color and structure how to

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
structure a sketch and then

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,840
also how to make some generative color

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,320
palettes

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,640
this week we're going to review what we

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,520
did last week

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,399
regarding uh composition then we're

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,320
going to look at gestalt psychology

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,239
which is sort of another way of looking

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:54,960
at

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
how people perceive art visual art

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,520
and then we're going to talk about sine

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,440
cosine and noise so how to bring those

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,840
things

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,319
into your motion to make things feel

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,280
more natural

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,080
and how exactly one might map those to

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,600
natural motion so what are these things

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,760
good for how would i use them

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,600
a lot of this week code wise is just

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
going to be examples of how to bring

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,159
sine and cosine

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,240
into your code and i'm going to hand you

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,000
those tools so that you can bring them

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,240
into your generative art pieces just

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,560
getting sine cosine and noise set up is

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,640
quite a bit of work uh so we're going to

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,759
focus on

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,960
the the conceptual side of utilizing

45
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,799
sine and cosine so that you're able to

46
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,240
pull that into any kind of work that

47
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,000
you're already doing

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and then we're obviously going to do our

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,479
code demo

50
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,640
before we do anything though let's hop

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,040
over to the p5.js website

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,560
i want to show you where the docs are

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,640
how to find them because i think it's

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,079
super important for you to reference

55
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,600
them and in fact i put this

56
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,680
in the end of lecture one and lecture

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,720
two and got

58
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,079
so invested in utilizing

59
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,399
our code time that i totally forgot to

60
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,000
show you how to get to the references so

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,079
let's just briefly hop over there

62
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,520
we'll talk through it so that you know

63
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
what the references are how to use them

64
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,840
why they're important

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,280
okay so here we are we're on the

66
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,360
reference page for p5.js

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,239
the reference page is located at

68
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:19,040
p5.js.org backslash

69
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
reference and it's super great because

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,080
you can see

71
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,520
there's a search bar here um if you want

72
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,200
to get to the reference from the main

73
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,560
page you can utilize that search bar on

74
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,720
p5js.org

75
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640
or you can go ahead and click on that

76
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,040
left hand side that says reference from

77
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,400
the home page and it'll take you to the

78
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,319
same place

79
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,840
i'm going to show you how to utilize the

80
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,680
references just so that you can

81
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,400
understand

82
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
how you might utilize this in your code

83
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,000
it's a

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,200
great way to look for something that

85
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,800
you're having trouble with

86
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
and either it's the end of the course

87
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,720
and office hours are unavailable

88
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,280
or you're just looking for a quick fix

89
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,200
so here you can see we've got the

90
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,680
ellipse documentation we've utilized an

91
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,800
ellipse before

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
they show you a quick example at the top

93
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
of the page and then they break down

94
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,040
each of those parameters talking about

95
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,360
what each of them actually means

96
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,560
this is a great place to go if you're

97
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,680
looking to expand your skills it's also

98
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,040
a great place to go if you just have a

99
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,959
quick question on how to utilize one of

100
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,040
the parameters inside of your code

101
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,120
and i utilize the docs all the time i

102
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,959
think these are top tier docs

103
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,920
so as far as a library goes these are

104
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
really fantastic for

105
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,000
utilization in your code work and i

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,440
strongly recommend you spend some time

107
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,319
with them so again that's p5js.org

108
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,959
backslash reference and take a look at

109
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,560
them so that you can also use me as a

110
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,000
resource for how to navigate around the

111
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,879
docs if you have

112
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,920
any questions about that in this class

113
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,720
cool

114
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
so let's jump back over into our lecture

115
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,080
i just wanted to give you a quick

116
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,480
overview of how the documentation works

117
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,599
and where to find it

118
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,120
so that you can use that in your own

119
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,959
work in the future

120
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,760
okay awesome so here we are we're back

121
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,200
on our lecture

122
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,680
and we're going to start by going into a

123
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,400
review of

124
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,720
our composition so last time we talked

125
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,840
about how

126
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,439
art composition is kind of made up of

127
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,200
two concepts the first

128
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,720
being the the visual elements which i

129
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
used

130
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,040
a metaphor an example of like a house is

131
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
built out of walls and windows

132
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,280
however a house can be described as

133
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,240
spacious or

134
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
cozy so the walls and windows would be

135
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
the visual elements of a house

136
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,720
and the principles of composition of

137
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,520
architecture

138
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,000
might refer to something like spacious

139
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
or cozy

140
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,320
or warm something like that we talked

141
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,800
about

142
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,600
visual elements of art so what are the

143
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,840
actual pieces that make up an art piece

144
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,680
and how can you look at those things

145
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
how can you you know tear a piece apart

146
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,600
and see what it's actually made out of

147
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,320
we talked about line work and how lines

148
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,520
can be thick or thin

149
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,240
they can be scratchy or smooth they can

150
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,560
be

151
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,600
long or short curved or straight and we

152
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,039
talked about the fact that when you're

153
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,560
making generative art you

154
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,720
have to be really conscious of the ways

155
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
that you're drawing your lines

156
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,360
when you're doing art on a piece of

157
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,080
paper

158
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,199
a lot of times the the way that you

159
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,199
create that art whether it's a marker or

160
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:19,520
you're

161
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,039
cutting out with an exacto knife or

162
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,560
something like that that kind of affords

163
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
a certain type of wine

164
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,720
p5js also affords a certain type of line

165
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
typically these are smooth lines

166
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,479
and if you're not doing anything to

167
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,759
modify them they're just going to be

168
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,360
straight lines

169
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,960
with like hard corners on them so

170
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,720
being critical of the lines that you're

171
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,800
using what the line thickness is

172
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,280
whether you have stroke on in your piece

173
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,160
at all

174
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,000
super important to the way people are

175
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,120
going to perceive that work of art

176
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,039
we talked about how shapes are balanced

177
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,039
differently in different works of art

178
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,800
and the best way to get an idea of

179
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,400
really any of these visual elements is

180
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,039
to start looking at other people's works

181
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,080
we talked about how tone and color

182
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,240
are kind of different but very related

183
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,919
so what is the contrast like in your

184
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:06,639
piece

185
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
is it very light very dark is there a

186
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,400
lot of dynamic range inside of that tone

187
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,319
are you seeing things that are very warm

188
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,520
very cool

189
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,280
and then we talked about color in terms

190
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
of color palettes so are they using an

191
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,639
analogous color palette

192
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,240
are they using a contrasting color

193
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,000
palette where on that color wheel are

194
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,479
they grabbing colors from

195
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,120
patterns of course are lots of repeating

196
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,280
elements and they can appear in lots of

197
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,639
different ways and lots of different

198
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,680
places throughout a piece so utilizing a

199
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,479
pattern

200
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,720
that is dappled around your piece might

201
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,319
create a sense of balance

202
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,400
or using many patterns might create a

203
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,759
sense of dissonance

204
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,919
so looking into the way an artist is

205
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,880
using repeating elements in a work part

206
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,039
we talked about texture and the ways

207
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,720
that you can utilize texture

208
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,400
in your work in p5.js a lot of the

209
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
pieces that i've shown you have some

210
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,919
sort of overlaid texture on them

211
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,360
and i did promise you that i'm going to

212
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,680
show you how to use texture in your work

213
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,199
so we'll visit that a little bit in our

214
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,120
code demo as well today

215
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,599
and then last we talked about form so

216
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,160
what

217
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,919
volume is occupied by your subject

218
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,720
versus your background this is different

219
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,840
than shape because

220
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,919
shape is just focusing on the

221
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,280
overarching shape of

222
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,680
each element in the piece whereas form

223
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,800
is actually looking at the

224
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,520
entire subject and the way that it's

225
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,680
shaped and how it takes up space

226
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,599
form is definitely going to come back

227
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,759
inside of our gestalt psychology today

228
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,319
so

229
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,360
keep an eye out for it then we take all

230
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,199
of those things and we combine them into

231
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:39,919
this

232
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,880
overarching language for discussing art

233
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,240
composition so

234
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,919
what is the flow of a piece what's the

235
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,680
rhythm do you get hung up on certain

236
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,319
parts of it or does it feel very smooth

237
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,720
is it balanced and symmetrical or is

238
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,319
there a lack of balance that's creating

239
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,479
a sense of emphasis on a certain part of

240
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,520
the piece

241
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,759
or for example is the artist utilizing

242
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,120
the rule of thirds and placing their

243
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,400
subject inside of

244
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,599
that third of their canvas to create a

245
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,039
really intense emphasis

246
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,080
on a single piece gradation so

247
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,400
are any of the changes color-wise

248
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,800
shape-wise form-wise are they gradual or

249
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,319
are they immediate are you seeing a lot

250
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,280
of contrast or very little contrast

251
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,520
we talked about harmony and variety so

252
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,680
this can be any type of again any type

253
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,080
of element from the previous slide can

254
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,240
be utilized in a harmonious way

255
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
or can have a lot of variety in it so

256
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,479
are you seeing visual elements repeated

257
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,880
often inside of the piece or are you

258
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,799
seeing lots of contrast

259
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,599
is that creating a sense of balance and

260
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,399
emphasis

261
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,320
what exactly is happening there so all

262
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,760
of these things are kind of

263
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,000
stacked on top of each other to create a

264
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
rhetoric of artwork

265
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,880
then we talked about movement just a

266
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,399
quick reminder that movement is

267
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,320
referring to a sense of movement in a

268
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,399
work of art it does not have to deal

269
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,959
with actual physical movement inside of

270
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,160
a work of art

271
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,640
however physical movement has its own

272
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
level of movement and we are going to

273
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,000
talk about that as well in gestalt

274
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,959
psychology

275
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,600
but essentially does the piece feel feel

276
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,480
still

277
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,040
and calm or does it feel really active

278
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,720
does it feel like the subject is moving

279
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,920
to somewhere else

280
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,160
we showed some examples of a real

281
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,080
intense sense of movement in a piece of

282
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,000
art

283
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
the contrast to that would be the frida

284
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,279
kahlo piece that we looked at

285
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,519
is a very still work of art the subject

286
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,880
is laying flat

287
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
and there's no sense that anyone is

288
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,040
going anywhere

289
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,160
the last way of discussing composition

290
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,040
in art is proportion and scale so do you

291
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,360
see

292
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,440
things that are very similarly sized or

293
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,959
are they very different

294
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,920
are you seeing a really regular sense of

295
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,120
scale so are things

296
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,040
going towards a vanishing point or are

297
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,839
things irregular and maybe

298
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,360
non-realistic how is the artist

299
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,519
utilizing scale to create

300
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,640
a sense in a sense of feeling

301
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,360
or purpose or theme inside of their work

302
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
of art

303
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,200
so last thing that we're going to visit

304
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
which i think is the most important part

305
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,399
of art composition and it does apply to

306
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,480
this gestalt psychology as well

307
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,160
when you have the language for something

308
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,839
you're able to discuss that thing and to

309
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,760
see that thing so there is some research

310
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,880
that shows that

311
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,720
cultures that don't have names for

312
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,480
colors are unable to perceive

313
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,000
those colors so if you don't have a name

314
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
for movement or balance or emphasis

315
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,160
inside of this art frame you're not

316
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,519
going to be able to see that

317
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,279
and therefore you won't be able to apply

318
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,720
that inside of your own work

319
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
so that's why we're discussing the ways

320
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,920
that you look

321
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,720
at artwork so that you have the ability

322
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,040
to

323
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,600
self-reflect and also to look critically

324
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
at other people's art so you can bring

325
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,839
their elements inside of your work so

326
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,360
all i can really do is teach you

327
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,440
language ways of looking

328
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,600
it's your job to go do the looking and

329
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
find the inspiration so go find the art

330
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,519
that feels right to you that

331
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,480
inspires your own work utilize these

332
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,120
frames

333
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,959
to then bring those concepts into a

334
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,560
piece of art that you are trying to

335
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,920
create in p5.js

336
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,640
today we are going to focus heavily on

337
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,480
the math for art section

338
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,720
and then of course the art side the

339
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
theory side of our lecture today is

340
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
going to be entirely gestalt psychology

341
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,880
so

342
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,320
now we're kind of checking off all of

343
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
these boxes which is kind of incredible

344
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,360
we've already talked about art

345
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
composition and color theory we've

346
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
dabbled in math for art utilizing

347
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,320
recursion

348
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,040
we also talked about sign a little bit

349
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,800
right at the end of our code demo last

350
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,360
week

351
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,480
we're going to look into that in more

352
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,880
detail this week and then of course next

353
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,320
week we're going to finish out

354
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,640
utilizing data visualization and apis

355
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,680
cool so let's jump into the theory part

356
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,959
of this week's lecture

357
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,360
talking about gestalt psychology so

358
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,560
gestalt psychology

359
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,880
is this form of psychology that began at

360
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
the beginning of the 20th century

361
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,639
that's based around the belief that

362
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,720
humans should be looked at as an entire

363
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,360
system

364
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,880
rather than looking at your mind and

365
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,320
body as separate things so they

366
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,680
basically argue

367
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,399
that there's a biological basis for the

368
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,480
ways that humans perceive the world

369
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,680
around them

370
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,920
and they end up in all of this

371
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,839
experimentation finding some

372
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,920
universal principles for the ways that

373
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,279
people perceive

374
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,800
things and specifically they're really

375
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,079
interested in the ways that people

376
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:24,560
perceive

377
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,200
grouping so gestalt actually means

378
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,920
grouping

379
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,000
or something to that effect in german

380
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,480
there are a very similar set of

381
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,279
principles

382
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,680
in gestalt psychology to art composition

383
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,440
so first there's a way of

384
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,720
looking and then we're going to look at

385
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,480
the actual deep down principles so we're

386
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,680
kind of going backwards

387
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,120
we're going to look at the overarching

388
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,279
umbrella and then we're going to zoom in

389
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,720
and look at each of the individual

390
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,560
principles and how you might apply that

391
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,200
inside of your work

392
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,519
inside of this framework basically the

393
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,880
discussion is around

394
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,000
how your brain might actually work to

395
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,480
perceive things and we've narrowed it

396
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,200
down to

397
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
four basic principles the first

398
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,240
principle is reification

399
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,639
basically the idea is that humans

400
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,959
perceive things as more than just ink on

401
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,519
a page

402
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,000
so we like to make meaning out of things

403
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
that maybe are even a little bit

404
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,880
abstracted

405
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,639
so when you're looking at even an

406
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,320
abstract work of art people are often

407
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,279
asking themselves

408
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,279
how does what does this mean how does

409
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,279
this look is this representational

410
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,440
and that's the real idea behind

411
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
reification humans really like to make

412
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,079
meaning out of a piece of art

413
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,199
or anything for example multi-stability

414
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,959
is the idea that if you are having an

415
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,199
ambiguous perceptual experience

416
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,959
your brain will flip-flop back and forth

417
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,880
between either of those things so

418
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,040
the the dress that went around on the

419
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,279
internet the blue and black and

420
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,880
white and wasn't it yellow or something

421
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,720
like that that would be a great example

422
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,079
of multi-stability

423
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,320
if you can see both of those options

424
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,839
your brain is going to be flipping back

425
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,760
and forth you can't see both at the same

426
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,480
time

427
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,120
that's the concept of multi-stability

428
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
invariance

429
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
is the idea that your brain can tell

430
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,880
that an object is the same regardless of

431
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,480
the way that it's oriented or the way

432
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,720
that it's lit so for example i've got

433
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,000
this flash drive here

434
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
if i show it to you at this angle you'll

435
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
be able to perceive it at any angle and

436
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,519
know that it's the same

437
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,040
object it's kind of a magical thing in

438
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,160
my opinion

439
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,399
people don't get confused when you show

440
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,160
them a glass that's upside down

441
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,600
you know our brains are able to

442
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
consistently perceive something even if

443
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,720
it's rotated or lit

444
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,360
differently and then the last principle

445
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,320
in this framework

446
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,760
is emergence basically the idea here is

447
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,120
that we make meaning

448
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,760
by seeing things as parts of a whole

449
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
rather than just seeing them as parts so

450
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,959
there's a big relationship between

451
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,040
reification and emergence again the idea

452
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,920
is that

453
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,240
you're not just going to be looking at

454
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,279
the actual

455
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,600
representation you're going to try and

456
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,880
make meaning out of it and you're going

457
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,240
to make meaning out of that

458
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
representation by grouping the elements

459
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,600
together

460
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
so let's look deeply into what each of

461
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
these things actually mean in practice

462
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,720
i'm going to give you an example for

463
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,079
each of them so that you can

464
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,480
incorporate them into your brain

465
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,920
additionally

466
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,480
where the vocabulary is extremely

467
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,160
important for the art composition

468
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,720
principles because people utilize them

469
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,839
to discuss works of art these

470
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,320
vocabulary terms are more important that

471
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,360
you understand

472
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,000
the principles the meaning the semantics

473
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,519
behind it rather than actually

474
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,959
remembering the words

475
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,959
at least in the art world people aren't

476
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,040
typically using words like reification

477
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,399
and multi-stability

478
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,560
but these concepts are very important to

479
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,759
creating a compelling work of art

480
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,800
okay so breaking these things down we've

481
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,199
got

482
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,160
reification and again you'll remember

483
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,079
this is the idea that there's more to

484
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,079
human perception than ink on a page your

485
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,680
brain wants to make meaning out of

486
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,120
something it wants things to be

487
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,639
representational

488
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,639
so my question for you is just to take a

489
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,800
moment look at this and tell me

490
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,639
what you see on this page

491
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,399
technically these are just shapes

492
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,120
but if i know anything about gestalt

493
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,000
psychology

494
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
you will perceive this as an actual

495
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,759
serpent that's represented here so

496
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,920
that's the concept of reification

497
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,519
you're not just seeing shapes you're

498
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,639
seeing a representation

499
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,279
next we've got multi-stability this is

500
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,040
something that's utilized a lot

501
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,880
in any kind of visual

502
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,839
optical illusion and this is a very

503
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,440
common one so hopefully you've seen it

504
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:37,920
before

505
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,759
there's an old woman here you can see

506
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,360
her nose her

507
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,680
mouth her chin this is kind of like

508
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,360
something that's covering her hair

509
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,959
and then this is her hair these are her

510
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,800
eyes or

511
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,959
you can see a young woman so this is her

512
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,120
hair she's looking off to the side this

513
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,240
is her ear

514
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,959
this is her eye her chin and then this

515
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,560
is her neck she's wearing some sort of

516
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,839
necklace so in multi-stability the idea

517
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,440
is you cannot see both of these things

518
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,079
at the same

519
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,839
time your brain is going to be flipping

520
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,599
back and forth between both of these

521
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,559
representations

522
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,199
this is the principle of invariance that

523
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,880
we talked about the idea that you can

524
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,919
see something

525
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,720
that is rotated or represented in a

526
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,079
different way but your brain will

527
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,160
perceive them all as the same object

528
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,400
just being represented differently so

529
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,000
this is what allows us to

530
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,160
make a shape and move it around or

531
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
rotate it inside of p5.js without

532
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,600
confusing people

533
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
we don't think oh it's over there now it

534
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,960
must be something different

535
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,480
we'll perceive it as the same object

536
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,320
and then last we've got emergence this

537
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,000
is the concept that we make meaning by

538
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,440
seeing things as a

539
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,919
group as parts in a hole rather than

540
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,679
individual components so

541
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,559
when i look at this piece here i see a

542
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,360
neighborhood

543
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,559
i don't just see squares and boxes nor

544
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,000
do i just see houses

545
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,640
i see an entire grouping that means

546
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,200
something

547
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,240
different than one of those individual

548
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,120
pieces alone

549
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,280
so we can take this gestalt framework

550
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,760
and

551
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,880
combine all of those all of those ways

552
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,120
of looking at human perception to create

553
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,600
eight

554
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,840
grouping principles so these are the

555
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,160
actual ways that one might apply this

556
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,480
information to creating a meaningful

557
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,440
piece of art

558
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
just a quick reminder that these things

559
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
might feel super obvious to you

560
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,039
but again very similar to the work that

561
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,720
we did in art composition

562
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,039
you need to know the concept of them so

563
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,400
that you can start playing with them in

564
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,280
your own work

565
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,520
and utilizing them to tell stories

566
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,360
i split these things up into two parts

567
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,600
you can see part one and part two

568
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,520
similar to what we did with the

569
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,880
with these things um with the framework

570
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,840
we're going to talk about each of them

571
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,600
as an overview and then we're going to

572
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,440
look at an example so that you can see

573
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,039
how those things might actually be

574
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,240
applied or utilized the first four we've

575
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,480
got here are figure ground

576
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,200
law of proximity law of similarity and

577
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,600
law

578
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,240
of closure these definitely apply to

579
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,880
things that are typically

580
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,360
still but you could definitely utilize

581
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,520
them in motion as well

582
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,200
the idea in figure ground is that your

583
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
brain separates the foreground and the

584
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,720
background of a piece of art

585
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,400
and it will just do it naturally your

586
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,760
brain really likes to know where the

587
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,960
figure is in a piece

588
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
and it's going to work really hard to

589
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,320
find that figure i'm going to talk to

590
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,640
you

591
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,960
in a moment about what actual principles

592
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,039
make up a figure versus a background and

593
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,480
how you might utilize that inside of

594
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
your work

595
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,240
the next we've got the law of proximity

596
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,360
so the idea

597
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,039
there is that you perceive things as a

598
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,039
group that are close together

599
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,120
so inside of our code we might

600
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,919
put circles really close together and

601
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,600
scatter different groups of them around

602
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,240
the page

603
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,760
to make someone perceive that those

604
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,520
things are in the same

605
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,000
group next we've got the law of

606
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,880
similarity

607
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,520
this is the idea that stuff that looks

608
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,080
the same

609
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,000
is perceived as a part of the same group

610
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,840
so maybe perhaps instead of putting

611
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,120
stuff close together

612
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,840
you have different things of different

613
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,880
colors

614
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
and different shapes so your brain is

615
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,400
going to perceive things that are the

616
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,080
same shape and the same color as a part

617
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,799
of the group

618
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,559
even if they're separated across long

619
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,400
distances on your page

620
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
and then last we've got the law of

621
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,360
closure this is the idea that your brain

622
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,200
is going to fill gaps to create a figure

623
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,880
so your brain really likes to see things

624
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
as a whole that's what we talked about

625
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,840
inside of

626
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,240
the principles that make up all of these

627
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,679
grouping principles

628
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,280
and we like to we like to make

629
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,760
shapes so even if there's gaps inside of

630
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,039
a piece you'll see it

631
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,320
as an actual figure

632
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,360
next we've got the law of symmetry the

633
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,720
law of common fate

634
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,640
the law of continuity and the law of

635
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,919
past experience

636
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,559
a couple of these have to do with motion

637
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,320
the idea here is that the law of

638
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,039
symmetry

639
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,520
is you see things as formed around a

640
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,640
center line

641
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,799
and things that are on opposite sides of

642
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,000
that center line are going to feel

643
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
grouped together so if something is

644
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,320
symmetrical

645
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,760
you're going to see those things as a

646
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,000
part of a group the law of common

647
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,919
fate is the idea that things that are

648
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,000
moving or pointing in the same direction

649
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,120
are a part of a group this is very

650
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,360
common in like a flocking behavior so if

651
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,480
you see

652
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,600
a school of fish or some kind of birds

653
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
and there is a group flying east

654
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,679
and a group flying west you'll perceive

655
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,440
them as being grouped based on the

656
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,520
direction that they're moving

657
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,600
next we've got the law of continuity the

658
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,280
idea here is that if the shape

659
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,080
goes behind another shape you'll see see

660
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,280
that shape is the same

661
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,320
so for example if you were to create a

662
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,000
ball that moves behind

663
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,280
a square and that ball kind of like goes

664
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
inside of there and comes back out your

665
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,120
brain will see that as the same

666
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,240
object last we've got the law of past

667
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,080
experience so this one is i think

668
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,120
in my opinion the most obvious of these

669
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,200
eight grouping principles the idea here

670
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
is that you bring a past experience to

671
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,120
the way that you perceive things

672
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,039
and it's super important to remember in

673
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,480
your artwork that

674
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,799
if you are presenting it to a group of

675
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,640
people from a specific culture you need

676
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,799
to be aware that their past experience

677
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,720
may vary from a different culture of

678
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,159
people so

679
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,679
my favorite example for something like

680
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,679
this would be people who read

681
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,520
left to right right to left top to

682
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,440
bottom you need to be aware that the way

683
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,280
that those people see your work of art

684
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,320
is going to be different

685
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,840
someone who reads left to right will

686
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,520
also read your artwork from left to

687
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,080
right

688
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,840
people who read right to left will do

689
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,399
the opposite

690
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,760
now we're going to break these things

691
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,880
down and look at each of them

692
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,799
individually really quickly

693
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,760
so the idea here is that you should see

694
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,559
a figure

695
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,240
and a background ask yourself really

696
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,760
quickly what is the figure what is the

697
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,320
background

698
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,200
the idea in gestalt psychology is that

699
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,720
figures are convex

700
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,039
so that means they have like rounded

701
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,679
corners they stick out

702
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,000
they are symmetric they are small and

703
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,600
they are enclosed

704
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,159
so you never want your figure to overlap

705
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,760
on the outsides of your canvas

706
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,919
that may confuse someone as to whether

707
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,440
it's the figure or whether it's the

708
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,240
background

709
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,600
unless of course that's what you want to

710
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
do so if for some reason you're finding

711
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,039
that something kind of feels mushy

712
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,799
or it doesn't actually feel like a whole

713
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,159
piece try

714
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,080
bringing it closer into your canvas

715
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,760
making it a little bit smaller

716
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,919
making sure that it's enclosed and then

717
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,799
giving it

718
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,960
a fill also could be great so a little

719
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,640
bit more contrast between foreground and

720
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,520
background

721
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,600
can make your piece really feel like a

722
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,559
figure underground

723
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,240
next as we talked about is the law of

724
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,799
proximity things that are close together

725
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,640
look grouped so the question for you

726
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,559
here is how many groups do you see on

727
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,159
this page

728
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,440
in theory because of the law of

729
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,279
proximity and gestalt psychology

730
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,840
you should see three groups so when

731
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,039
you're utilizing

732
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,760
things in balance in your artwork and

733
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,200
you're trying to create a sense of

734
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,159
symmetry

735
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,640
it's really important that you look at

736
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,600
how things are

737
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,640
grouped inside of your artwork before

738
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,400
you start assessing whether something is

739
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,600
balanced or not

740
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,960
when you're looking at a piece of art

741
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
for a really long time you can lose the

742
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,200
fresh eyes the fresh perception

743
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,880
of someone who's looking at your art for

744
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,039
the first time which is why we utilize

745
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,880
these principles of gestalt psychology

746
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,440
and art composition so that you can

747
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,600
theoretically see this thing with fresh

748
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
eyes even if you don't have the fresh

749
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,400
eyes

750
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,320
so if you're looking at balance in your

751
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,919
piece you want to make sure your piece

752
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,679
is balanced something is off or

753
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,480
awkward maybe look at proximity do

754
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,960
things look grouped inside of your piece

755
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
and can you either spread them out a

756
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,240
little further or

757
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,480
balance the groups rather than balancing

758
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,840
the individual elements

759
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,840
we talked about this so the law of

760
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,760
similarity is the idea that

761
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,640
things that look similar look grouped so

762
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,080
my question for you would be

763
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,400
how many groups do you see on this page

764
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,200
i see

765
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,880
three two sorry i gotta learn how to

766
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,440
count

767
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,520
um i see an orange group and a blue

768
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,480
group

769
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,279
and there is a sense of balance in this

770
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,279
piece but you'll notice that it's a

771
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,120
little bit

772
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,360
off-center because we've got one blue on

773
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,039
this side and two orange and then we've

774
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:21,360
got

775
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,679
two blue on this side and one orange so

776
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,400
again

777
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,559
how can you combine what we learned last

778
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,480
week with what we're learning this week

779
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,400
by seeing things as grouped and then

780
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,159
maybe looking at the ways that you can

781
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,840
utilize those grouping principles to

782
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,600
make a more balanced composition

783
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,279
oh one more thing about this slide

784
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,559
things that

785
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,679
look the most dissimilar

786
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,760
make for the best similarity in your

787
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,120
pieces so

788
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,360
squares and circles are very contrasted

789
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,400
shapes so they will be really easy for

790
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,520
someone to group

791
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,640
squares versus circles or you'll want to

792
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,520
use

793
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,440
color palettes that are complementary so

794
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,120
cool and warm which is what i'm doing

795
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,919
here

796
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,760
that'll increase the contrast between

797
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,520
those pieces and it will make the effect

798
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,279
more obvious inside of your artwork

799
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,520
here's another example we're utilizing

800
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,279
squares instead of circles

801
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,440
that are different colors so again same

802
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,360
exact concept here

803
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,279
things that look different look like

804
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,880
they're part of a different group

805
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,640
here we have two groups the square group

806
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,919
and the circle group even though

807
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,440
everything is the same color

808
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,640
you should perceive these things as

809
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,360
separate groups

810
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,080
here we have closure so here you should

811
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,840
see a circle even though

812
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,679
these things are broken up it's a dotted

813
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,120
line so

814
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,679
this is great if you want to create a

815
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,880
sense of

816
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,679
connection or movement in your piece but

817
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,039
you want to do so in a way that's a

818
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,320
little bit more visually interesting

819
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,000
than just drawing straight lines

820
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,159
this will come back into play later in

821
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,600
our coding demo

822
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,559
but essentially dotted lines are a great

823
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,640
way to make a sense of movement and a

824
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,080
sense of

825
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,799
visual interest it's a type of pattern

826
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,520
and again

827
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,279
back to the line work elements of

828
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,919
composition you can utilize things that

829
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,520
are not connected while still

830
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,159
also creating a sense of grouping and a

831
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:14,799
sense of

832
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,279
movement

833
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,120
here we are in our second set of four

834
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,080
we've got

835
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,000
symmetry symmetry is the idea that

836
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,080
things are symmetrical look grouped

837
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
so i'll ask you here how many of these

838
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,000
groups do you see

839
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,919
this one's kind of fun because i kind of

840
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,279
see two different sets of groups here

841
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,200
there are obviously six individual

842
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,600
brackets and then you should honestly

843
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,320
see

844
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,159
two groups because we've got the law of

845
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,360
similarity here

846
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,279
we're working with the different types

847
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,600
of brackets but then you should also see

848
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,200
three groups so we've got one group here

849
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,760
one group here and one group here so

850
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,440
this is a great example of how you can

851
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,159
utilize

852
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,159
different gestalt principles in the same

853
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,159
piece to create a sense of

854
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,880
connection and that's very similar to

855
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,840
the pattern

856
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,120
in our art composition principles how

857
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,000
can you

858
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,960
create a sense of balance potentially

859
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,279
through

860
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,399
symmetry

861
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,080
we've got the law of common fate i've

862
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,000
got a moving example for you in a moment

863
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,679
but again this is the idea that things

864
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,919
that are moving together look like

865
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:24,960
they're grouped together

866
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,840
so here i see four groups but i also see

867
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,320
two groups and that's because we've got

868
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,640
things that are close together but we

869
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,159
also have things that are moving in the

870
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,360
same direction

871
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,679
i am also manipulating you a little bit

872
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,440
because i have these things scaled

873
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,480
differently

874
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
so that is going to give a little bit

875
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,760
more contrast

876
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,360
and that's the law of similarity right

877
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,960
so these are a little bit bigger these

878
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,320
are a little bit smaller

879
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,360
therefore we're using actually

880
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,520
three two different principles three

881
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,720
different principles so we're using

882
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,600
grouping

883
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,200
we're using common fate and then we're

884
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,039
using the law of similarity to creative

885
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,200
sense of groups here

886
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,480
and the best example of this is

887
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,720
again schools of fish this video is just

888
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,000
so lovely to watch

889
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,159
i could watch it all day we're not going

890
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,440
to watch it all day

891
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,480
but you can see these beautiful fish are

892
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,240
all moving in the same direction

893
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,919
and so your brain should be perceiving

894
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,919
them as a part of the same group

895
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,200
this is a great example i don't know if

896
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,720
you saw them go by that there's a couple

897
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,159
fish that are swimming in the opposite

898
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:24,960
direction

899
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,080
they're gonna feel like they're part of

900
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
a different group this is

901
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
so important for the motion graphics

902
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,279
work that you do

903
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,640
because you want to make sure that

904
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,320
everything feels balanced you want to

905
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,600
make sure that your groups are

906
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,039
on kind of an even distribution on your

907
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,640
page and

908
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,840
utilizing potentially symmetry

909
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,399
or common fate can bring a sense of

910
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,000
balance into your piece

911
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,240
even if your elements are not exactly

912
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,039
balanced on the page

913
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,120
here we have the sense of continuity so

914
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,799
you should see two keys and those keys

915
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,159
should look connected to you in some

916
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,279
kind of way

917
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,000
even though you don't see them being

918
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,520
connected so your brain is going to

919
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,200
assume that something is continuous if

920
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,960
you see both sides you see those lines

921
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,000
connected

922
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,480
even if you don't see the line behind

923
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,080
the other piece

924
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,240
so this is great if you're going to use

925
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,640
x's or like i said you're going to use

926
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
um potentially pieces that are

927
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,240
overlapping with each other inside of

928
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,039
your work

929
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,799
it's safe to assume that a person is

930
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,480
going to see those things as the same

931
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,760
when they come out the other side

932
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,520
that also means that the ways that

933
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,799
you're balancing a piece and the ways

934
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,399
that you're composing a piece need to

935
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,480
take into account the missing elements

936
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,520
that your brain is still

937
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,799
filling in with your work last we have a

938
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,799
lot of past experience

939
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,240
i have a traffic light here because i

940
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,159
think that's a great example just about

941
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,159
everyone has an association with the

942
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,039
colors red

943
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,200
yellow and green when they are paired

944
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,159
together

945
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,840
so if you're bringing that into your

946
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,240
piece be mindful

947
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,440
of the ways that someone might be

948
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,519
bringing some kind of past experience

949
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,880
into the ways that they perceive your

950
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,120
work

951
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,919
all right team so we did it this is

952
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,919
always a hard topic to teach no matter

953
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,600
how many times i've gone through it it's

954
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,880
just like a

955
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,120
so much information for me to throw at

956
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,640
you all at once

957
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,880
i have these grouping principles just

958
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,840
reviewed again

959
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,399
inside of this slideshow so just take a

960
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,159
minute to self check and make sure you

961
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,000
understand the concept between each of

962
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,720
these

963
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,200
and then if you need to revisit the

964
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,720
beginning of the lecture and just

965
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,559
double check on any of these go ahead

966
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,240
and go back so

967
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,799
here's the second half of them it's a

968
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,000
lot of information

969
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,440
i'm really grateful that you went

970
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,880
through it with me i wish we could spend

971
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,320
more time on it but i want to make sure

972
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,559
that we get the time to also do coding

973
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,480
so i know we went fast take a moment

974
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,080
to self-check and then we're going to

975
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,199
move on to our code

976
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,840
so math we're going to look at sine

977
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,360
cosine and noise

978
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,519
i love sine cosine and noise i think

979
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,399
they're like

980
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,159
magical concepts i said this about

981
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,440
recursion too

982
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,760
math and code and the ways that those

983
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,960
things can turn into

984
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,360
a beautiful piece of compelling art just

985
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,919
will never stop being exciting to me so

986
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,360
i hope you're excited to learn sine

987
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,000
cosine and noise as well

988
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,960
we're going to do a little bit of a

989
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,519
trigger review so buckle up

990
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,519
you'll remember from your trig class in

991
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,360
high school or middle school or

992
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,640
college whenever you took trig that sign

993
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,440
is a function that represents the

994
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,159
opposite

995
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,320
side of a right triangle over the

996
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,440
hypotenuse so

997
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,760
we've got like a triangle like this and

998
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,519
we've got an angle here

999
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,600
and this would be the opposite side and

1000
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,519
this would be the hypotenuse

1001
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,120
i have an actual image here i don't know

1002
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,039
why i'm holding on my hands for you

1003
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,440
but the idea is to utilize the radial

1004
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,399
coordinate system

1005
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,720
and some tricks of geometry to be able

1006
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,080
to figure out

1007
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,760
the different legs of a triangle

1008
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,120
and here's an example so we've got

1009
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,720
we've got theta which is this piece here

1010
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,600
we've got the hypotenuse and then we've

1011
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,880
got the opposite side

1012
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,480
so let's do that math really quickly

1013
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,760
oh theta opposite side i didn't need to

1014
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,039
point them out for you i pointed them

1015
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,240
out inside of my

1016
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,279
presentation so we've got

1017
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,960
the angle which is 135 degrees

1018
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,720
you can use degrees or radians here

1019
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,559
we're using degrees and you need to make

1020
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,200
sure that

1021
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,600
whatever you're using is in agreement

1022
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,320
with

1023
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
the computational system you have so

1024
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,600
your calculator or

1025
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,240
your p5.js sketch needs to be in the

1026
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,919
same radial mode

1027
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,480
in the same angle mode radians or

1028
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,919
degrees

1029
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,960
and then we have the length of

1030
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,880
our opposite side which is 1.4

1031
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,320
we've got it negative because we're on

1032
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,399
the negative side of the axis

1033
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,480
here and then we have the length of the

1034
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,000
hypotenuse which

1035
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,480
for the sake of ease the radius of our

1036
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,039
circle

1037
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,960
is two and either way if you do this

1038
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,600
math

1039
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,039
you're going to come out with the same

1040
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,880
number

1041
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,519
which is like um

1042
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,040
0.707

1043
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,078
this is one of like the

1044
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,520
the ones that you have to memorize for

1045
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,280
trigonometry the answer is the square

1046
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,359
root of two over two

1047
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,040
i'm not asking you to memorize these

1048
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,560
things you just need to know the general

1049
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,079
concept of sine and cosine

1050
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,119
so the idea is of course boiling

1051
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,800
everything down

1052
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,280
sine is an oscillatory function that

1053
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,079
goes between

1054
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,599
positive one and negative one and

1055
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,079
it crosses the x-axis at

1056
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,800
360 degrees and 180 degrees

1057
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,079
it's at positive 1 at 90 and negative 1

1058
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,679
at 270. so you can see on the right hand

1059
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,839
side an animation of what sine

1060
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,160
actually looks like if you're plotting

1061
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,280
it

1062
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,480
like on a moving radian direction

1063
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,240
cosine is exactly the same concept but

1064
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,839
opposite so instead of being the

1065
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,160
opposite side it's the adjacent side

1066
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,760
which means that

1067
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,960
where the sine function

1068
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,839
crosses the x-axis at 180 degrees and

1069
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,920
360 degrees or pi

1070
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,119
and 2 pi the cosine function

1071
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,800
crosses the x-axis at 90 degrees

1072
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,640
or half pi and then 270 degrees

1073
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,040
or what is that two

1074
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,920
so it would be three three pi over two

1075
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,800
rainfart

1076
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,720
um so basically on the right hand side

1077
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
you can see here the comparison

1078
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
between the sine function and the cosine

1079
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,040
function

1080
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,240
and we have cosine starting at one

1081
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,640
sine starting at zero so sine is blue

1082
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,839
cosine is green

1083
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,079
same concept oscillatory function

1084
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:56,880
between one

1085
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,280
and negative one they're just the exact

1086
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,240
opposite concept

1087
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,160
and then this is a review here so we

1088
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,599
have a regular pattern

1089
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,920
that oscillates between one and negative

1090
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,320
one how many times can i say that

1091
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,240
and the idea is also that we're moving

1092
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,400
slow and then fast and then slow so if

1093
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,000
you look at the slope of this function

1094
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,560
here

1095
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,640
you see it will get a little bit faster

1096
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,599
and then it kind of

1097
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,760
evens out and then it gets a little bit

1098
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,680
faster and then it kind of evens out so

1099
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,599
the question for you is what are some

1100
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,000
types

1101
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,280
of motion that are oscillatory and

1102
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,440
move from slow to fast to slow in a

1103
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,680
regular pattern

1104
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,480
a great example would be a flapping wing

1105
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,640
so a butterfly wing a bird wing

1106
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,079
something like that if you wanted to

1107
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,400
simulate that type of movement

1108
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,480
always always always go to sine and

1109
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,400
cosine

1110
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,720
another great example would be a

1111
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,440
pendulum

1112
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,280
i think this is beautiful you could

1113
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,200
absolutely after this course

1114
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,079
go and animate this inside of p5.js

1115
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,920
super simple and you could set it up

1116
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,400
where this

1117
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,119
is one and this is negative one and then

1118
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,040
you're just using parts of the circle

1119
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,880
to kind of make this beautiful repeating

1120
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,160
pattern gorgeous

1121
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,440
another thing i would point out about

1122
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,400
this here is that the color is changing

1123
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,599
in a similar pattern except for it's not

1124
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,359
oscillating back and forth it's going

1125
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,960
back to the beginning each and every

1126
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,760
time

1127
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,880
so they are actually utilizing some

1128
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,280
just additive motion here so i would use

1129
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,960
some kind of like if statement

1130
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,280
and say if we're at the last one go back

1131
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,599
to the first one

1132
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,119
great so what is purlin noise if sine

1133
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,079
and cosine are

1134
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,160
some sort of oscillation between one and

1135
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,920
zero that's regular

1136
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,160
parallel noise is an irregular pattern

1137
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,240
it also oscillates but it oscillates

1138
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,079
between zero and one

1139
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,359
and the speed change is gradual but it's

1140
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,240
irregular

1141
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,040
so the idea behind perlin noise is to

1142
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,920
take

1143
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,079
something that's random and make it a

1144
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,520
little bit more natural

1145
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,680
true random should place dots all over

1146
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,800
the canvas in

1147
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,599
kind of an even spread purlin noise will

1148
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,920
kind of cluster those dots into certain

1149
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,000
areas of your canvas

1150
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
it's much more visually appealing than

1151
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,160
true random because people like order

1152
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,960
and groups as we learned today and it

1153
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,800
was invented by this mathematician ken

1154
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,760
perlin

1155
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,000
for the movie tron he actually won an

1156
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,160
academy award for his mathematical

1157
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,359
contribution

1158
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,720
and the idea is to make natural looking

1159
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,839
patterns that are still randomly derived

1160
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,000
so a great example of what you could use

1161
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,040
purlin noise for

1162
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,359
is this dog tilting its head you see

1163
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,520
it's oscillating but it's a non-regular

1164
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,320
movement

1165
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,880
it does speed up and slow down which is

1166
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,000
something that is definitely

1167
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,240
doable within the purlin noise space but

1168
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,400
it's not a regular oscillation like sine

1169
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,359
and cosine

1170
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,800
as opposed to that bird flapping its

1171
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,599
wings which was very regular

1172
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,440
and this is our last example and it

1173
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,359
happens to be my favorite

1174
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,160
this represents sine and cosine and also

1175
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,040
perlin noise

1176
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,079
so just self-check what in this is sine

1177
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,520
and cosine and what in this

1178
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,200
is proline noise what i see

1179
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,119
is that the swing swinging back and

1180
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,839
forth is sine and cosine so you can see

1181
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,760
that's a regular oscillation where

1182
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
things slow down and speed up

1183
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,839
and we're not losing any motion here too

1184
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,440
just a note

1185
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,079
where is this like numbing little

1186
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:26,880
hamster

1187
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,359
is moving in an irregular but

1188
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,800
oscillatory way

1189
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,720
so that would be utilizing purlin noise

1190
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,000
all right so here we are let's jump over

1191
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,280
to our p5.js

1192
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,040
editor and go through some quick

1193
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,119
explorations of all of the ways that you

1194
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,280
might start utilizing perlin noise

1195
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,119
and sine and cosine so we're going to go

1196
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,680
fast we're bringing a lot of information

1197
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,720
into this lecture

1198
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,400
i'm going to throw a bunch of stuff at

1199
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,839
you so buckle up

1200
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,760
but the idea here is just to give you

1201
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,680
some starting points for utilizing

1202
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,839
purlin noise and sine and cosine

1203
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,520
inside of that gestalt psychology

1204
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,359
principles to create a piece of art so

1205
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,560
we're just going to give you a starting

1206
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,599
point this week

1207
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,040
and then you'll be able to take that as

1208
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,800
far as you want to go with it

1209
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,599
okay so we've jumped into our p5.js

1210
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,319
editor

1211
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,440
and we're going to start by just mapping

1212
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,040
out what sign

1213
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,240
uh and purlin noise look like just

1214
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,319
for the sake of things looking nice i'm

1215
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,480
going to change our background to be

1216
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,200
just black flat black and then we're

1217
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,280
going to take our stroke and make it

1218
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,119
completely white so we're adding just

1219
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,160
like a ton of contrast to our piece

1220
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,680
and then i'm going to make our stroke

1221
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,839
weight three just so we can have like a

1222
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,119
really thick stroke

1223
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,680
again high contrast and then we're gonna

1224
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,240
make it

1225
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,520
no fill because we're gonna use the

1226
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,760
shape command i don't know if we've used

1227
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,520
this yet but it's a super great command

1228
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,319
and totally worthwhile to use it

1229
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,760
next we are going to start utilizing

1230
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,640
uh our shape

1231
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,000
and we need to make a loop in order to

1232
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
create our sine function

1233
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,079
the goal here is we're going to actually

1234
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,599
graph it out across

1235
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,160
the x-axis just exactly the same way as

1236
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,280
you would see it

1237
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,720
on any sort of like graph so

1238
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,920
we'll create a for loop same as we

1239
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,800
always do

1240
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,400
start with i equals zero i is less than

1241
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
height and then i'm going to add like 10

1242
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,560
just so we make sure that we're going

1243
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,760
off of the sides of the screen oh

1244
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,880
i actually want to do width

1245
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,200
um here it's trivial because the width

1246
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,319
and the height are the same thing

1247
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,359
but we are moving across the x-axis so

1248
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,400
that's why we're going to want to do

1249
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,079
width instead of height

1250
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,000
and then we'll add one to i every time

1251
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,359
we loop

1252
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,640
and i'm going to add an end shape

1253
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,720
outside of our loop so basically the

1254
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,560
idea of the shape command is we're going

1255
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,280
to add a

1256
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,640
vertex into our piece

1257
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,640
so vertex being like the side of a shape

1258
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,000
so suppose i wanted to

1259
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,319
manually create like a triangle i would

1260
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,480
actually create like an x y coordinate

1261
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,640
at each of those places and then do

1262
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,599
begin shape and

1263
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,240
end shape uh here though we're going to

1264
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,880
use this

1265
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,720
just to basically draw like a never

1266
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,880
ending looping line

1267
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,160
and we're going to create a vertex at

1268
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,800
um i and then i'll just show you how

1269
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,920
this works by doing i

1270
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,839
and i so basically what this should do

1271
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,839
is create just like yeah a diagonal line

1272
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,040
across our canvas

1273
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,240
we could also do i and

1274
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,560
height divided by two and that will just

1275
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,160
create a horizontal line so i hope

1276
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,599
that's making sense basically we're

1277
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,000
putting

1278
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,040
one point at every single

1279
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,640
pixel across the screen utilizing that

1280
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:46,960
eye

1281
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,720
loop so we're doing pixel pixel pixel

1282
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,480
pixel and then we're doing it all

1283
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,119
at a y position so this is our x this is

1284
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:53,760
our y

1285
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,359
we're doing it all at a y position of

1286
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,200
height divided by two so the very center

1287
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,400
of the canvas

1288
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,079
but that's not what we want to do we

1289
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,760
want to graph our sine function

1290
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,920
so i'm going to create a variable called

1291
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,119
y

1292
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,240
so they're var y

1293
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,000
and then our variable y is going to be

1294
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,440
mapped utilizing that sine function to

1295
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,160
the height

1296
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,760
so basically what mapping does

1297
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,440
is it will take the value and then

1298
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,160
do the math to make it the scale that

1299
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,520
you want it to be so basically we're

1300
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,160
modifying the scale of this function

1301
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,800
and the first argument here is the value

1302
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,560
that's being passed into the map

1303
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,440
function

1304
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,240
the second value is the minimum value of

1305
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,000
the function that we're passing into the

1306
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,440
map function so here

1307
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,760
sine the minimum value is one the

1308
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,800
maximum value

1309
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,880
or sorry minimum negative one maximum

1310
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,920
one

1311
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,359
and then we're going to map the value of

1312
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,920
negative one to the value of zero

1313
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,760
we're going to map the value of positive

1314
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,200
1 to the value of

1315
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,920
height so basically what we're saying is

1316
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,520
everywhere that the sine

1317
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,119
equals 1 we want it to be the height of

1318
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,160
the canvas

1319
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,920
and anywhere that the sine equals

1320
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,839
negative 1 we want it to be at position

1321
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,599
zero so now we should get something that

1322
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,280
kind of moves back and forth between the

1323
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,200
top and the bottom of the canvas

1324
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,079
using that sine function and in order to

1325
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,440
see that of course we need to change our

1326
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,400
vertex to be

1327
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,480
y cool so it's really smooshed

1328
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,800
together and that's because it's using

1329
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,079
the

1330
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,560
the two pi so every time we get to the

1331
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,760
value of about

1332
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,720
six and a half we're going to see the

1333
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,640
function move back and forth so these

1334
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,280
are

1335
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,240
about six pixels wide which is way way

1336
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,160
way too squished for us to get anything

1337
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,599
a value out of it

1338
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,680
so the best way to change that is just

1339
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,800
to change

1340
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,640
the value that's being passed into our

1341
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,880
sine function and make it smaller as we

1342
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,079
move across the canvas

1343
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,720
so i'm going to divide our looping value

1344
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,359
of i

1345
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,720
by 30. the bigger the denominator the

1346
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,640
wider your wave is going to be

1347
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,760
so now we've got our wave that's going

1348
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,040
by 60. so each time we go across we're

1349
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,240
going

1350
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,240
i divided by 60 and you see we've got

1351
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,640
approximately a single face here kind of

1352
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,480
similar to the idea of

1353
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,119
six pixels equals one time around the

1354
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,079
circle

1355
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,160
now we're doing 60 so we're seeing just

1356
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,480
like you see a little bit more

1357
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,839
than a single a single rotation

1358
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,839
so this is us graphing sine if you

1359
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,760
wanted to graph cosine of course you can

1360
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,640
just

1361
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,400
swap those things out and now you can

1362
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,160
see sine and cosine

1363
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,640
kind of on the actual canvas in your

1364
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,800
p5.js sketch

1365
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,680
now let's take this same concept and

1366
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,240
take it

1367
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,280
over to purlin noise so

1368
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,079
we'll remember that purlin noise is

1369
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:46,640
mapped

1370
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,319
from 0 to 1 and we're going to take

1371
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,160
this function and swap it out with

1372
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,160
the function for noise so we'll do noise

1373
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,640
i

1374
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,160
same thing divided by 30.

1375
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,599
so now we see here is kind of this

1376
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,599
jagged line we talked about how perlin

1377
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:06,800
noise is

1378
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,280
something that is also oscillatory but

1379
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,119
it's randomly oscillatory

1380
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,280
and it's a little bit more jerky the

1381
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,160
best way to see

1382
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,400
the ways that perlin noise changes so

1383
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,560
the randomness concept of purlin noise

1384
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,920
is actually just to

1385
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,240
refresh your sketch every single time

1386
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,920
and then you can see that purlin noise

1387
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,079
refreshing along with it

1388
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,400
if we wanted to see our porlin noise

1389
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,560
actually moving across the screen

1390
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,720
we could start to map to something

1391
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,800
related to the frame count instead of

1392
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,960
mapping it to i

1393
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,560
so i'm going to start making some

1394
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,920
changes to this sketch so we can

1395
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,040
actually see

1396
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,200
our purlin noise moving across our

1397
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,960
screen

1398
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,880
first things first we are going to

1399
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,520
oh where should we start okay so we are

1400
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,480
going to add

1401
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,079
this variable x offset

1402
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,839
to our loop and the idea of x offset is

1403
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,880
every time we loop

1404
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,880
through we're going to add a little bit

1405
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,000
to our x

1406
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,520
to change where it is on the screen

1407
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,359
purl and noise oh you know actually

1408
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,800
before we get into this i want to

1409
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,079
actually show you

1410
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,720
how purlin noise changes across the

1411
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,160
canvas

1412
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,560
so let's print out our value of noise

1413
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,319
each time we go through this loop

1414
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,079
so let's do print

1415
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,359
noise i divided by 30

1416
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,040
and then you'll actually be able to see

1417
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,880
as we loop through in your console

1418
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,359
oh it's not printing sometimes in oh

1419
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,000
there goes

1420
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,920
sometimes in p5.js when you put a print

1421
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,359
function in a loop function it just

1422
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,960
takes a little while to run

1423
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,160
so you can see here as we move

1424
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,880
across the canvas so as we're passing in

1425
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,400
a different value of i

1426
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,240
or a different x value because that's

1427
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,000
the way we've structured our function

1428
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,240
we're seeing these values of purlin

1429
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,440
noise coming out

1430
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,720
and changing in a decimal way so always

1431
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,680
mapped between zero and negative one if

1432
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,599
you wanted to see the actual value

1433
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,200
that's being graphed you could always

1434
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,880
just copy this

1435
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,599
mapping function and print that out

1436
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:10,720
inside of your

1437
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,000
sketch so let's give it a minute

1438
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,280
and now we can see the function which is

1439
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,200
essentially just taking that decimal

1440
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,960
value and multiplying it times the

1441
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,920
height

1442
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,280
so that's the way you would utilize

1443
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,720
perlin noise and that'll give you like a

1444
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,319
picture of what the purlin noise value

1445
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,400
actually is inside of your sketch

1446
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,359
okay back to it let's actually start

1447
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,240
creating

1448
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,079
kind of a scrolling function across our

1449
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,000
screen so you can see how purlin noise

1450
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,559
changes

1451
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,000
over time so we have

1452
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,240
now this function that's creating this

1453
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
random purlin noise mapping each and

1454
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,680
every time you run your sketch

1455
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,280
but we want to take that and turn it

1456
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,960
into something that's scrolling across

1457
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,480
the screen so you can see how perlin

1458
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,319
noise kind of changes gradually over

1459
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:54,800
time

1460
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,680
i also just kind of think this is super

1461
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,680
visually pleasing so it's a fun thing to

1462
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,200
learn how to do

1463
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,760
it's quite simple to add basically what

1464
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,559
we're going to do

1465
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,880
is add something that moves our

1466
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,319
our x value along the side of our screen

1467
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,880
a little bit at a time and then we're

1468
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,400
going to take something

1469
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,079
that also increments our x value as we

1470
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,599
move through our loop

1471
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,880
so in order to add something that

1472
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,559
increments our x value as we move

1473
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:27,520
through our loop

1474
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,680
we're going to add a variable called x

1475
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,440
offset

1476
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,240
and then we're going to make our x

1477
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,640
offset value

1478
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,280
equal to zero and then the next thing

1479
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,119
we're going to do is add that into our

1480
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,440
loop

1481
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,839
yeah my capitalization is all right and

1482
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,680
then each and every time we run through

1483
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,960
our loop we're going to add

1484
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:55,680
0.005 to our x offset so

1485
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,359
basically we're taking the same thing we

1486
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,599
did with i where we divided it by 30 but

1487
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,000
we're just standardizing this process

1488
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,040
and then we're going to add that in

1489
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,480
i'm going to remove this print function

1490
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,559
because it asks a lot of my computer for

1491
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:09,280
some reason

1492
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,319
let's see okay so

1493
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,359
comment this out

1494
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,440
and then we're going to map y to the

1495
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,839
x offset no we'll map it to i so every

1496
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:22,960
time we go across

1497
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,920
we're going to map y which is this

1498
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,640
mapped value

1499
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,800
utilizing the x offset across the screen

1500
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,240
so we should get something very similar

1501
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,599
to what we got last time we're just

1502
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,200
spreading our noise out a little bit

1503
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,000
farther

1504
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,079
so instead of incrementing it by one

1505
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,280
every time we go through the loop

1506
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,160
we're actually only incrementing it by

1507
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,680
0.005 this is fun because you can see

1508
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,280
how the the noise kind of spreads itself

1509
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,520
out as you change this value

1510
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,960
and how you can have a smooth noise

1511
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,240
versus like a a rougher kind of noise

1512
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,839
so now we want to take this and start

1513
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,839
scrolling it across our screen

1514
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,839
and the way we do that would be adding a

1515
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,800
value that changes

1516
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,440
each and every time we reload the sketch

1517
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,880
so when we're moving through like the

1518
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,920
frame count

1519
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,920
per se so the first thing i'm going to

1520
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,520
do is make that value

1521
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,880
equal to 0.01 so we're kind of on the

1522
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,760
same

1523
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,559
um the same scale as our x offset value

1524
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,400
and then we're going to create a

1525
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,440
variable called start

1526
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,760
that we will set our x offset to

1527
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,400
we are going to initialize our start

1528
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,040
variable

1529
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,160
inside our setup function so that it

1530
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,240
loads in as 0 but then we are able to

1531
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,920
change it as we go so that's going to

1532
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,400
allow our x to move across the screen

1533
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,920
as we start moving through our function

1534
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,680
and then the last thing we need to do is

1535
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,599
set our start

1536
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,880
um so that it increases by the same

1537
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,800
increment every time we move through so

1538
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,240
now basically what we're saying is

1539
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,160
increase our start value each and every

1540
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,480
time you draw our draw function

1541
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,480
so that we're moving our x across the

1542
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,640
screen so we're moving our x offset

1543
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,960
inside of this for loop but we're also

1544
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,680
moving it

1545
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,760
outside of our for loop so we're

1546
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,680
scrolling it across our screen

1547
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,040
this is really fun because you can start

1548
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,079
to change again the x offset value

1549
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,160
so wild and then you can also start to

1550
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,000
change the increment value over here

1551
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,319
so that allows you to move it faster or

1552
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,640
slower what have you

1553
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,920
cool so this is us mapping our

1554
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,599
purlin noise and then seeing it scroll

1555
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,280
across the screen i think

1556
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,880
this in itself is a really beautiful

1557
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,480
piece of art now we're going to take

1558
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,040
this and utilize it to move some circles

1559
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,319
around our screen

1560
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,400
in the sine function and the perlin

1561
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,680
noise function in

1562
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,400
one dimension and two dimensions so

1563
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,119
let's start

1564
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,200
a new sketch go ahead and save this

1565
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,919
make a new one

1566
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,000
and then we're gonna start drawing some

1567
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,319
ellipses so i'll leave my background to

1568
00:52:58,319 --> 00:52:59,200
220

1569
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,040
i'm gonna say no stroke just because i

1570
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,720
think circles look great without a

1571
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,000
stroke on them

1572
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,880
and then i'm going to create we'll do

1573
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,400
two ellipses first

1574
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,040
to compare purlin noise to sine and

1575
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,520
cosine

1576
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,960
so if you wanted to you could just

1577
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,319
double check that you remember how to

1578
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,000
make an ellipse you'll remember

1579
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,640
it's the x value the y value and then

1580
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,520
the

1581
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,319
the width and the height so we could do

1582
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:25,839
like

1583
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,319
x value would be width over two

1584
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,680
height over two and then we're going to

1585
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,680
do 30 30. so now we should get an

1586
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,200
ellipse in the very center of our canvas

1587
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,960
and it's white by default

1588
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,319
now we're going to take this and start

1589
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,400
doing some noise with it

1590
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:48,640
so we'll do noise is the frame count

1591
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,160
yeah that's right and then we should

1592
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,400
see it kind of moving but the problem is

1593
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,720
that we are moving it by just such a

1594
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,319
small amount that we want to

1595
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,680
make it multiplied times the width

1596
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,359
so we're actually moving back and forth

1597
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,599
between each side of the canvas

1598
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,920
we see this is going super duper fast so

1599
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,359
same as always we're gonna divide this

1600
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,280
by like 30 so you can see it kind of

1601
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,800
start to slow down a little and you can

1602
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,440
actually

1603
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,839
enjoy the concept of noise and you

1604
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,200
remember back to what we did on the

1605
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,640
other screen this looks so

1606
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,480
similar it's almost like it's drawing

1607
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,000
that line in two dimensions

1608
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,880
for you here and then we're going to do

1609
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,319
the same thing with this ellipse only

1610
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,240
we're going to utilize the sine function

1611
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,920
so we're going to do sine frame count

1612
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,040
and then we already know it's going to

1613
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,720
be super fast so instead of wasting our

1614
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,559
time we'll divide it by 30.

1615
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,200
we have to map it to the width but the

1616
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,240
width

1617
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,880
because we're going from negative 1 to 1

1618
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,880
we're going to utilize width divided by

1619
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,079
2 rather than multiplying it

1620
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,640
by the width with noise because noise is

1621
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,559
a decimal value

1622
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,359
and then we're going to do height over

1623
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:58,880
two so we put this in the center of the

1624
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,920
canvas again

1625
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,680
and then we'll make them both the same

1626
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,720
size so 30 30

1627
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,000
oh i have two semi-colons there great so

1628
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,839
it should be really apparent to you

1629
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,599
oh so we are going by the width of the

1630
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:14,240
canvas

1631
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,240
but we need to make sure that we also

1632
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,559
move it to the center so let's do width

1633
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,119
divided by two and add that into our

1634
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,160
sign

1635
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,520
great so now we have two little circles

1636
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,160
here

1637
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,880
and one is oscillating regularly between

1638
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,319
the left side of the canvas and the

1639
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:31,760
right side of the canvas

1640
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,520
the other is kind of moving around

1641
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,680
irregularly that's obviously our noise

1642
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,720
function

1643
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,799
just for the ability to tell these apart

1644
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:39,920
because we're going to add two more

1645
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,440
ellipses to this canvas

1646
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,559
we're going to add some fill

1647
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,880
and this is just kind of like what i

1648
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,480
think will look good so we're gonna do

1649
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,720
some analogous colors here

1650
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,319
and then we are going to do the same

1651
00:55:58,319 --> 00:55:58,960
thing

1652
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,880
we're gonna make two more ellipses and

1653
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,240
this time we're going to utilize

1654
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,200
a two-dimensional noise for our second

1655
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,880
ellipse and then we're going to do

1656
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,240
two dimensions of sine and cosine

1657
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,000
with our second ellipse so you can see

1658
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,559
how these things can be translated into

1659
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,359
not just a linear movement but actually

1660
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:18,720
how are you going to take them into your

1661
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,720
second dimension on your canvas

1662
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,480
so first things first we'll do noise

1663
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,000
because we did that first last time

1664
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:31,359
and then same thing we'll do noise

1665
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:35,200
frame count divided by 30

1666
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,079
times width and then instead of just

1667
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:38,640
keeping

1668
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,559
our ellipse at height divided by two

1669
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,160
we're going to utilize noise a second

1670
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,040
time

1671
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,359
so if i do noise

1672
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,480
frame count divided by

1673
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,280
30 times height what's going to happen

1674
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,880
is it's basically going to end up moving

1675
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,040
in a diagonal line because the value

1676
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,319
of the noise is going to be the same

1677
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,160
for both the x position and the y

1678
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,680
position so let's just see what that

1679
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,640
looks like really quickly

1680
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,640
great so you see here we're moving at

1681
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,559
the same x value so these two little

1682
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:11,280
dots

1683
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,200
let's change our fill so you can see the

1684
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,720
difference here we'll do

1685
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,598
fill 200 100 250

1686
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,480
so you can see this dark purple dot and

1687
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,680
this greenish dot

1688
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,240
greenish yellow dot are both moving at

1689
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:26,880
the same

1690
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,160
x position and then this purple dot is

1691
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,839
doing the same thing in the y direction

1692
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,920
so we're getting just a diagonal line

1693
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,079
we don't want a diagonal line so we're

1694
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:36,960
going to actually

1695
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,160
modify the value that we're passing

1696
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,319
in to the noise function and that will

1697
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:43,839
make it move around a little bit more

1698
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:44,640
randomly

1699
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,480
you can do this in two ways you could do

1700
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,160
this by changing the value you're

1701
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,839
dividing your frame count by so you can

1702
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,599
see now it's kind of moving around

1703
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,359
randomly in the y direction and the x

1704
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:54,880
direction or

1705
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,799
you could also add a different value to

1706
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,319
the frame count to give it a little bit

1707
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,520
of an offset

1708
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,880
oh the plus sign comes after the 30.

1709
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,359
so now same thing moving in the x

1710
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,720
direction at the same

1711
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,799
rate as our green dot but we're moving

1712
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:12,240
around in the y direction a little bit

1713
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,599
more randomly

1714
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,160
either way works and then last but not

1715
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,480
least

1716
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,160
we'll change the fill one more time so

1717
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,880
we can make another ellipse

1718
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,599
and then we are going to use sine and

1719
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:26,559
cosine

1720
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,319
and i'll ask you what you think it's

1721
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:29,599
going to do and then we'll see what it

1722
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:30,640
actually does

1723
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,480
so as we did before we are going to map

1724
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:34,880
this

1725
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,000
to the width divided by 2 and then we're

1726
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,839
going to add the width divided by 2 to

1727
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,400
our function so we'll add it first

1728
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,760
sine frame count divided by 30

1729
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,000
and then multiplied by width divided by

1730
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,359
2. if you have

1731
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,200
any hang ups on why we're doing this

1732
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,960
multiplication in addition feel free to

1733
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,240
just come to office hours

1734
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,920
basically the idea is we need to move it

1735
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,520
to the center of the canvas which is why

1736
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,440
we're adding width divided by two

1737
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,559
and then we need to normalize our

1738
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,720
phase we need to normalize our height

1739
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,119
our movement back and forth to the width

1740
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,319
of the canvas so that's why we're

1741
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,000
multiplying it by two because we'll have

1742
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,520
one and negative one

1743
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,400
so our maximum value will be width and

1744
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,200
then our minimum value will be zero

1745
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,319
okay so next we're gonna do the same

1746
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:20,960
thing

1747
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,200
we're gonna do it in the y direction so

1748
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,680
instead of width we'll do height

1749
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,200
and then we're gonna use cosine instead

1750
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,119
of sine because remember cosine

1751
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,520
is the opposite side or the adjacent

1752
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,119
side and sine is the opposite side so

1753
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,559
we're going for the

1754
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,319
x value and the y value if you can

1755
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,839
remember back to the plot that we were

1756
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:38,880
looking at

1757
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,000
and then we're going to do the same

1758
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,160
thing so frame count

1759
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,960
divided by 30 times height

1760
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,520
divided by two and before i finish out

1761
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,160
this function

1762
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,079
just be asking yourself what do you

1763
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,920
think is going to happen

1764
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,960
when i draw this ellipse

1765
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,000
and here we go so

1766
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,240
just exactly the same way that you

1767
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,079
looked at that graph and saw sine and

1768
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,520
cosine are changing

1769
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,680
and they're creating a circle map on the

1770
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,440
graph we're doing the same thing so you

1771
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,880
see this red dot that's moving around

1772
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,880
that's how you would create a circle so

1773
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,559
if for some reason i wanted my circle to

1774
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:15,440
move around

1775
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,079
faster i would change this frame count

1776
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,400
to maybe 30 from 30 to 20.

1777
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,119
now you see it moves around faster and

1778
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,480
then i don't know if you caught that

1779
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,400
we'll do it one more time if you start

1780
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,520
changing the phase

1781
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,040
you can do some really interesting

1782
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,119
movement that's oscillatory so we're

1783
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:33,440
still

1784
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,280
oscillating the x and y direction but

1785
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,799
we're moving out of phase

1786
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,160
so instead of getting a circle we're

1787
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,000
getting kind of this like weird

1788
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,480
um i don't even know what you would call

1789
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,520
it it's like a weird pattern around the

1790
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,280
around the um canvas

1791
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,599
and then in addition you could also make

1792
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:52,799
this more of an oval

1793
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,960
by changing the way that you're mapping

1794
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,400
the height so instead of dividing the

1795
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,640
height by two i could divide it by three

1796
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,240
and then you'll see that red dot kind of

1797
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,240
moves more in an ellipse pattern

1798
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,680
rather than moving in a circular pattern

1799
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,160
and i think the best way to show this is

1800
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:08,880
actually

1801
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,599
to comment out all of this code and then

1802
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,240
remove our background

1803
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,880
whoa just the background we don't need

1804
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,480
to go that crazy

1805
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,599
um so

1806
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,839
now you can see

1807
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,119
that i'm actually drawing this and it's

1808
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,720
not refreshing the background so you can

1809
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,559
see where it's drawing the shape

1810
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:33,920
so this would be a great opportunity for

1811
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,240
us to change this to 30

1812
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,520
and then i'm going to change this back

1813
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,359
to height divided by two so you can see

1814
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,960
what that like weird shape looked like

1815
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,400
because it'll actually trace it out for

1816
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,839
us

1817
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,240
i love utilizing this tracing function

1818
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,599
we haven't gotten into this yet

1819
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:50,240
but utilizing a trace is really fun for

1820
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:50,960
drawing

1821
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,640
like different shapes inside of your

1822
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,559
canvas and you could experiment with

1823
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,440
this

1824
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,520
another great utilization of the

1825
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,000
background is to use the alpha value

1826
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,839
so alpha refers to the transparency

1827
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:07,520
of your canvas so let's change it

1828
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,680
and then you can see this sort of slowly

1829
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,960
fades over time

1830
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,640
so you can change that alpha value and

1831
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,319
the higher the number

1832
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,400
the less transparent your canvas is

1833
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,319
going to be

1834
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:21,039
so you can think about we're drawing on

1835
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,960
top of that every single time

1836
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,599
so slowly the older path is going to

1837
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,359
start to fade out as opposed to when we

1838
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,039
had no background at all

1839
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,760
we just created that red line so now

1840
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,559
we've seen

1841
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,039
how to utilize the noise function in

1842
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,039
both one dimension and two dimensions

1843
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:39,280
and also how to utilize sine and cosine

1844
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,359
to draw circles or kind of weird

1845
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:42,240
ellipses

1846
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,799
or start to experiment with the face to

1847
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:47,039
create some like interesting patterns

1848
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,559
and then we also saw how you would

1849
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,960
actually graph out sine cosine and noise

1850
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,520
on your canvas moving in the x direction

1851
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,039
and of course you could flip that

1852
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,400
and move it in the y direction if you

1853
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,799
wanted to as well

1854
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:01,200
so last but not least just kind of as a

1855
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,720
little piece of bonus content

1856
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,640
let's look at how you would add some

1857
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,160
sort of texture to your canvas so i

1858
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,760
promised you that we would do this

1859
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,039
i'm going to show you where you can find

1860
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:11,920
some no attribution canvas

1861
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,520
or texture sorry and then i'm going to

1862
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,200
show you how you can actually bring that

1863
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,400
into your canvas

1864
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,880
all right team so bonus content time

1865
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,039
we're going to move kind of quickly

1866
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,960
i'm really grateful that you guys have

1867
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,400
stuck with me through

1868
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,039
this crazy jam-packed content i wanted

1869
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:28,400
to make sure you could get as much as

1870
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,359
you possibly could

1871
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,280
out of this week three we had a lot of

1872
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,119
content to cover and this texture is

1873
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,440
just

1874
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,119
an extra thing to throw in there in case

1875
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,640
you're interested in how to import

1876
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,280
textures

1877
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,799
inside of your p5.js sketches textures

1878
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,280
are an

1879
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,680
image file and i went ahead and grabbed

1880
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,079
one from this website called

1881
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:48,960
freestocktextures.com you can also

1882
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,240
utilize a website called

1883
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,000
pexels p-e-x-e-l-s-com

1884
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,520
essentially what you're looking for is

1885
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,440
something that is licensed so that you

1886
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,400
can utilize it

1887
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,640
in your art without getting copyright

1888
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,160
claimed so we're not going to go into

1889
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,559
details about how to utilize things that

1890
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,160
will prevent you from getting copyright

1891
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:06,640
claimed

1892
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,079
but essentially what you're looking for

1893
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,400
is free no attribution images so if you

1894
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,240
just go to google and look up

1895
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,400
free no attribution texture you'll be

1896
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,240
able to find a lot of stock image

1897
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,920
websites or you could pay for them

1898
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,200
of course so you could look for no

1899
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,200
attribution stock textures

1900
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,400
basically you're just looking for

1901
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,400
something that you can use without

1902
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,440
attributing that work to someone else if

1903
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,640
for some reason you find something that

1904
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,559
requires attribution make sure you go in

1905
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:30,880
and

1906
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,960
put it inside of your comments for your

1907
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,880
code it's a really standard place to put

1908
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,480
your attribution for your images

1909
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,079
or you can utilize an image that you've

1910
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,920
taken yourself just make sure you're

1911
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,839
always giving proper attribution to any

1912
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:42,720
images you bring

1913
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,160
into whatever works that you're working

1914
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,039
on so let's talk about how to bring an

1915
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,440
image inside of your p5.js sketch first

1916
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,799
you're going to click this little arrow

1917
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:51,520
here

1918
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,280
and if you click the drop down

1919
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,440
underneath sketch files you'll be able

1920
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:55,920
to click

1921
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,480
upload file this brings up this upload

1922
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,599
file

1923
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,359
pop-up and i'm just going to drag and

1924
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:02,640
drop that texture

1925
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,200
inside of my p5.js sketch it'll take it

1926
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,039
just a second to load in

1927
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:08,720
and you can see it's just an image

1928
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,559
that's a texture so you could do this

1929
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:11,359
with a regular

1930
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,839
image as well that has like a subject

1931
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:15,920
but i'm going to utilize this texture

1932
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,680
now just for simplicity's sake i'm going

1933
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,280
to rename this to be

1934
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,359
texture so that we can reference it

1935
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:23,200
inside of our code

1936
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,720
and then the next thing that we're going

1937
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,799
to do is actually import our image

1938
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:27,359
inside

1939
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:30,000
of our sketch so in order to do that we

1940
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,119
need to utilize this

1941
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,319
function called preload

1942
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:38,640
not capitalized just regular

1943
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,039
and then it looks exactly the same as

1944
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,720
the function setup

1945
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,000
we'll add our brackets and then we need

1946
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,119
to put

1947
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,559
load load load image

1948
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,680
texture and then it's a jpeg so we gotta

1949
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,599
do dots

1950
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:00,240
before you run the setup function i want

1951
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,520
you to load a variable

1952
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,640
call it img and load an image in

1953
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,839
called that's called texture.jpg so

1954
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,240
that's referencing our files if for some

1955
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,920
reason you had this nested inside of a

1956
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:12,400
folder

1957
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,000
called pictures so we could say like

1958
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,839
create folder pictures

1959
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,440
and then we could add our texture to it

1960
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,440
you would just need to put pictures

1961
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,280
backslash texture but right now our

1962
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,280
texture is just in our root folder for

1963
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,079
simplicity's sake next we are going to

1964
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,200
actually display

1965
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,039
our image and the first thing i want to

1966
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,520
do is load it in as a background

1967
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,480
and i want it to be located at zero zero

1968
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,240
i want it to be as wide as the width of

1969
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,480
the canvas and as tall as the height of

1970
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,760
the canvas

1971
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,000
so now we see we've got a beautiful

1972
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,599
texture in the background

1973
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,839
and we have our circle drawn on top of

1974
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:48,720
it this

1975
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,880
alone is really cool and you can take it

1976
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,079
very far i think

1977
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,359
that is enough to add some really cool

1978
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,440
depth and texture to any sort of image

1979
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,039
that you're working with

1980
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,359
but i also think it's cool to overlay

1981
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,119
your image on top of anything else that

1982
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,280
you're using inside of your sketch

1983
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,880
so basically the way we're going to do

1984
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,480
that is take our

1985
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,079
image and put it at the beginning of our

1986
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,760
draw function so

1987
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,599
now we've got our image drawing each and

1988
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,839
every time we add something to

1989
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,039
our sketch but i don't want it to get

1990
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:19,599
lost

1991
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:22,480
inside of that dot so instead of just

1992
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,319
drawing it every time

1993
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:26,400
at full opacity we're going to mess with

1994
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,079
the opacity so it'll overlay

1995
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,240
on top of our circle and the way that we

1996
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,920
do that would be utilizing

1997
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,039
this tint command and tint

1998
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,480
only applies to images basically what

1999
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,520
i'm typing in here

2000
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,839
is i want it to be untinted so fully

2001
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:42,559
white

2002
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,280
and then i want the transparency to be

2003
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,559
25

2004
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,480
so just the same as we did for

2005
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,720
transparency with our background

2006
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,559
the transparency is on a scale of 255

2007
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,400
and the lower your number the more

2008
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,720
transparent your image is going to be

2009
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,200
we're asking for a lot from my computer

2010
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,000
right now so

2011
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,280
i'm going to slow our frame rate down

2012
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,880
to like 20 instead of 60 the default

2013
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,799
and that'll get us a little bit less of

2014
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:12,160
a jerky

2015
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,880
a jerky result here but now you can see

2016
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,560
that that texture is being drawn

2017
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,359
on top of our circle and we're seeing

2018
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:20,158
the texture

2019
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:22,960
both as a background and as an overlay

2020
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,560
so that gives you an idea of how you

2021
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,158
could maybe potentially work in more

2022
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,479
than one texture into your piece

2023
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,560
or you can just work in a texture as a

2024
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,479
background so

2025
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:36,080
now you know how to utilize purlin noise

2026
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,319
how to utilize sine and cosine in one

2027
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,238
dimension and in two dimensions and then

2028
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:40,880
also

2029
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,279
how to draw a texture on top of your

2030
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:44,238
work

2031
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:45,759
and we've talked a little bit about

2032
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,359
gestalt psychology and how

2033
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,600
things look as they're grouped i think

2034
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,679
this is really going to come in handy

2035
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:53,759
both in reference to like i said those

2036
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:54,799
art composition

2037
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:57,040
concepts that we talked about last time

2038
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,399
but also

2039
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,080
in reference to the ways that we do our

2040
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,158
data visualization next class so we're

2041
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:02,880
going to wrap

2042
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,479
everything up next class utilizing apis

2043
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,799
and json files so that's going to be

2044
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:11,198
a very code heavy class next week if

2045
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:13,120
you're already familiar with json files

2046
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:13,439
and

2047
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:15,359
javascript apis you're way ahead of the

2048
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,960
game then we're going to take those

2049
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,319
things and visualize them

2050
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,479
inside of p5.js using all the things

2051
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:21,920
we've done so far

2052
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,640
this one again we went super fast so

2053
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,319
definitely come by office hours if you

2054
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,319
have any questions i really threw a lot

2055
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:29,600
of content at you

2056
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,920
also just go ahead and rewatch whatever

2057
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,520
i put up here i tried to be super

2058
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,238
thorough

2059
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:36,238
but i know that it went by super quickly

2060
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,679
so take your time with this

2061
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,040
really make sure you understand what we

2062
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,040
visited today and then we'll be able to

2063
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,479
stack that all on top of each other for

2064
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,158
next class so i look forward to seeing

2065
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:49,520
you to learn some data visualization

2066
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,600
you
