2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,519
hi everyone welcome back to the

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,440
introduction to fpv drone

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,440
course on hacker u my name is ayan and

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,960
i'm going to be your course instructor

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,239
this is the class 2 and i

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,760
already hope that you have attended the

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,240
class 1 where we talk about

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,240
the physics of drones physics of flying

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,439
and different components that goes

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,119
inside building a drone and

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,960
specifically we discussed about the star

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,519
of the class that was the propellers and

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,400
in today's

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,760
class we're going to talk about the

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,600
drone frames transmitters and receiver

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
which are the very vital components

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,280
so if you haven't already watched the

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,960
class one i would

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,719
highly recommend you go and watch that

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,399
first and then come back to this class

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,200
so

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,640
uh because this class has some

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,039
prerequisite from class to uh class one

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,039
uh but anyways without further ado let's

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,559
start uh with today's

27
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,480
agenda so today we're going to be

28
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,559
talking about the frame selection

29
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,640
and how different things comes into the

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,399
picture when you are deciding uh frame

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,920
for your drone application

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,160
uh we'll also be talking about if your

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,760
there are different materials available

34
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,280
uh in the market there are different

35
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
options if you should diy the frame if

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,200
you should buy someone else designed

37
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,760
frame already off the what shelf the

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
number of propulsion system which are

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
available in a frame and what materials

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,840
are they made up of for the shape of the

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,759
frame the geometry and how to assemble

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,320
it

43
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,159
so that about the frame selection then

44
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,439
we will be talking about the

45
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,479
transmitters

46
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,920
and the receivers will talk about

47
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,320
frequency uh the communication link and

48
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
how the communication happens

49
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,759
when you send some data from your

50
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,360
transmitter and how the receiver

51
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
receives it and it translates to the

52
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,759
drone motion

53
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,479
of your desire uh we'll talk about

54
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,280
frequency

55
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,920
will demystify some of the myths behind

56
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,200
frequency power

57
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,119
transmission losses and latency and so

58
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,960
on there would be some maps involved in

59
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,000
it so

60
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,759
that would be there then we'll talk

61
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,680
about receiver compatibility we'll talk

62
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,320
about

63
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,600
lrs and uhf and we'll talk what they are

64
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
so for now let's deal with the short

65
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,439
forms here

66
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,119
uh then we will also talk about

67
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,640
telemetry and how data

68
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,040
is sent back to the ground station to

69
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,079
where the drone is

70
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,160
being controlled uh we'll talk about

71
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,840
antennas and that is a very interesting

72
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,479
topic

73
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,720
uh we'll see how we'll talk about what

74
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,000
is failsafe and that's

75
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,480
the agenda of class two uh that is a

76
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,520
today's class so

77
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,319
let's talk about the drone frame variety

78
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:20,800
and

79
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,680
uh when uh in the last class i mentioned

80
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,080
that

81
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,319
when i'm talking about drone i want you

82
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,879
to think about a quadcopter because uh

83
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,800
drones can be of various type as it is

84
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,560
in the last class it could be fixed wing

85
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
it could be helis it could be even the

86
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,080
military drone but

87
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,879
uh to be on the same page to be uh on

88
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,560
the same understanding level i want you

89
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,200
to

90
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,519
think of a quadcopter that is a drone

91
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,720
with the four

92
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,720
uh four rotors on the top uh so

93
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,480
we'll talk about drone frames and we'll

94
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,840
see how different drone frames are

95
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,720
available

96
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,440
for you to choose from so on the on the

97
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,120
screen you can see a very small

98
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,440
tiny drone frame which is also known as

99
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,720
tiny whoop

100
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,480
uh this is a great beginner drone it is

101
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,000
meant to be fly indoors

102
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,200
it is uh using coreless dc motor which

103
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,319
are really cheap and

104
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,920
this also support fpv as you can see

105
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,159
there is an fpv camera and a transmitter

106
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:12,959
so

107
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,760
uh there are variety of drone drone

108
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,200
frame available and i'll show you in the

109
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,000
overhead cam

110
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,560
of different frames i have with me but

111
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,239
uh what are the frame options available

112
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,280
let's see so this is

113
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
one of the quadcopter frame which you

114
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
might have seen uh

115
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
the most because it's uh like a standard

116
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
size frame standard shape that is the x

117
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,799
shape a very

118
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,720
common geometry when we talk about the

119
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,159
quadcopters we have

120
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,720
four motors we have landing gears this

121
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,879
frame seems to be made up of wood

122
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,400
uh we'll also discuss what are the

123
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
advantages of having

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,400
a frame made up of wood as in this photo

125
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,319
versus the one which is made up of

126
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,400
plastic as the tiny whoop here uh

127
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
you also might have seen these kinds of

128
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
frame and these kind of frame are

129
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,480
especially

130
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,760
very common in a in cinema industry

131
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,560
where

132
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,319
they meant to carry some big cameras

133
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,159
like dslr or even some

134
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,879
cinema class cameras like alexa mini

135
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,239
alexa

136
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,799
the standard one or the alexa re even

137
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,799
the red cameras and black magic design

138
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,680
studios if you

139
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,519
know some cameras from the film industry

140
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,440
you might know you might have seen these

141
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,639
kinds of drone

142
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,479
uh the landing gear which you are seeing

143
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,680
are quite elongated

144
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,639
uh they are actually being folded these

145
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,160
landing gears fold up

146
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,520
when the drones take off and this

147
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
landing gear comes back to this position

148
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,040
when it's landing

149
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,160
this is also used so it can be

150
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
it can be picked up by someone on the

151
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,639
ground it can be hand launched if needed

152
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,240
at certain areas so that is why this

153
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
elongated landing uh

154
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,759
gears proves importance and they they

155
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,440
keep the operator very safe compared to

156
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,560
the one on the

157
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,759
on the right side because you can see

158
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,520
there is a quite a long gap in the

159
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,360
landing gear and where the

160
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,040
the motors of the drones are so it's

161
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,479
it's comparatively safe

162
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,280
and uh we'll see about different frames

163
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,240
so

164
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,039
these uh this is a small uh dji tele

165
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,960
drone which you can buy off the market

166
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,000
and you can see

167
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,759
there's a small camera maybe you can see

168
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,240
there are coreless motors so

169
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,880
comparatively these two drones are

170
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,639
almost same they have almost same

171
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,280
kind of motors the brushless sorry the

172
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,840
coreless

173
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,800
dc motor they both have cameras i think

174
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
this can do hd transmission i believe

175
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,160
and this is a normal one but

176
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,919
these both are quite same but you can

177
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,440
see that the design it's everything is

178
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,960
enclosed because it's a commercial

179
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,160
proprietary product

180
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,000
uh the company don't want to reveal all

181
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
their electronics which are inside

182
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and this is comparatively easy to get

183
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,600
inside so

184
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,199
i'm just showing you the different drone

185
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,360
frames so you get the idea of different

186
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,639
quadcopter frames available in the

187
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,840
market here is

188
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,000
another one which is used by the fpv

189
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,520
pilots like me for

190
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,759
freestyle and drone racing we'll talk

191
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,880
about how

192
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,560
these frames are different in

193
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
construction different in geometry and

194
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,120
what all

195
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,840
flight characteristics so it changes as

196
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,600
the frame changes

197
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,160
there's also this funny one i i think

198
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,120
it's funny

199
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,720
i'm not sure about you but this looks

200
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,639
funny it's like a very minimal

201
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,560
drone and this is meant for fpv racing

202
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,400
by the way this uh the

203
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,199
arms are very small the weight is very

204
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:17,600
less

205
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,759
because it has very less of parts

206
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,240
involved but it has a very high speed it

207
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,960
can

208
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,240
probably go up to 150

209
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,160
miles per hour or something like that

210
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
because it's very small and very

211
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,800
lightweight

212
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,960
but yes these are all the drone frames

213
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,560
the quadcopter frames commonly available

214
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,680
in the market as you can see

215
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,759
everyone has different application so

216
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,199
that is the motive of showing you this

217
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:39,840
slide

218
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,120
that there is not one frame which is the

219
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,479
best for you there is not

220
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,960
one frame which i can recommend you uh

221
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,319
to use there are

222
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,240
thousands of different frames uh in

223
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,400
terms of geometry in terms of material

224
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,919
in terms of how they mount the

225
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,120
electronics

226
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,560
like for example here you can see all

227
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,400
the electronics are exposed here it's

228
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,759
inside then

229
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,599
why someone choose to expose their

230
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,120
electronics versus someone choose to

231
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
hide the electronics so things like that

232
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,639
we're going to be discussing in today's

233
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,440
chapter so uh let me switch to the

234
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,039
overhead camera

235
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,319
and show you different type of drone

236
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,360
frames that i have so this is uh

237
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,280
my go-to fpv drone freestyle frame as

238
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,160
you can see

239
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,319
so this is a frame by a company called

240
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,280
armatan

241
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,080
chameleon so this is a frame from them

242
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,720
and

243
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,880
i have modified it to suit my needs and

244
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,039
we'll talk about modification in future

245
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,440
chapter so this is my go to frame

246
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,680
as you can see i have some other frames

247
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,759
with me as well as

248
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,360
like this so this is a tiny loop as i

249
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,199
showed in the ppt

250
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,080
here so this is the same frame but it's

251
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,840
disassembled right now

252
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,199
uh there are also a smaller one so this

253
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,479
is uh

254
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,240
almost like a fpv racing but this is a

255
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
smaller one meant for

256
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
very tight gaps and you know mostly of

257
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,720
the fun flying it cannot carry a gopro

258
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
or hd camera but it's

259
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,000
it has its own application it has its

260
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,160
own needs uh so yes

261
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
we'll be talking about frames more in

262
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,240
today's chapter so let's continue

263
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,360
okay so the very first thing that you

264
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,039
need to keep in mind when

265
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,360
buying a frame is the frame size so what

266
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
size you're looking for and uh

267
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
if you remember in the last chapter we

268
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
talked about the propellers and how

269
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,120
frames and propellers uh form a very big

270
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,639
constraint that you need to clear

271
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,080
on the very early on when you are

272
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,319
deciding on what application you need to

273
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,520
use your drone

274
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,919
uh so in the last uh chapter in the in

275
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,039
the last

276
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,000
class i showed that you cannot use any

277
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,919
size of propeller on any drone frame

278
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,799
because

279
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,640
the frame has some constraint the frame

280
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,399
construction in such a way that it

281
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
may not be able to spin one bigger

282
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,399
propeller because of space constraint

283
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,560
because of some other constraints so

284
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,920
that is why if you have chosen the

285
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,519
propellers already you need to choose

286
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,000
the drone

287
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
frame and when you're choosing a drone

288
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,440
frame the first thing you need to keep

289
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,200
in mind is the size so how do you

290
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,000
calculate

291
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,720
the size of a drone frame so the size of

292
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,920
a drone frame is

293
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,560
calculated diagonally motor to motor so

294
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,399
you you take any diagonal you

295
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,000
uh calculate the distance between these

296
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,839
two motors so the center of this motor

297
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,320
sand

298
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,839
uh this distance is in millimeters so uh

299
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,760
if you if you if you take a scale if you

300
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,440
uh measure the diagonal motors

301
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,880
in millimeter you'll get the size of the

302
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,600
frame so talking about uh

303
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,560
my frame so this is diagonally 130

304
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,720
millimeter frame so from one motor to

305
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,240
another motor diagram it's 130

306
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,440
millimeter

307
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,120
if you talk about this one this is more

308
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,560
like a 220

309
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,480
millimeter size frame from motor to

310
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
motor is 220 millimeter so

311
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
uh this is how the frame is calculated

312
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,560
the size of the frame is calculated and

313
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,200
that's

314
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,240
how the frame are being designed so it's

315
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,720
called

316
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,519
the drone frame classes so a very common

317
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,680
class is 450 size frame and when i say

318
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,760
450 size

319
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,720
frame or 450 size class frame uh what i

320
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,920
really mean is that

321
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,160
the distance from center of motor to

322
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,279
other diagonal motor is 450 millimeters

323
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,279
and that is a very common frame that is

324
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,519
a very common size uh more common before

325
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,200
the introduction of fpv drones in the

326
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,160
industry

327
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,959
uh because that is uh like the only

328
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,000
frame which was

329
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,279
easily available so if

330
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,200
this is like a 450 size drone you are

331
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
saying this is also somewhat like

332
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,240
500 class frames so yes that's how the

333
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,160
drone frames are being uh

334
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,079
sizes being decided so if you talk about

335
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
the fpv drone racing and freestyle the

336
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,160
the class which we use it's called 250

337
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,360
size frame

338
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,200
uh which can rotate a propeller of five

339
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,480
or six inches and

340
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,959
uh when we when we say 250 class it it

341
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,440
has anywhere between 210 millimeter to

342
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,519
270 or 280 millimeter of frame sizes

343
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,920
so the frame which i'm using here it is

344
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,200
a 220 millimeter

345
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,360
uh diagonally motor to motor so it comes

346
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,720
under 250 class

347
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,040
and 250 class frames are meant to rotate

348
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,399
propellers from let's say

349
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,079
four inches five inches and six inches

350
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,079
and so on

351
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,480
so that's how you decide the frame if

352
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,399
you have already know that you want to

353
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,160
have a drone which is running a

354
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,480
propeller of let's say five inches then

355
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,800
or 250 class is a good class to go if

356
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,320
you want a drone which can rotate let's

357
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,079
say 8 inches of propeller then you might

358
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:14,800
need to

359
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
go for a bigger size of frame like 450

360
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,680
class and so on

361
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
okay so moving ahead the second factor

362
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,399
that

363
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,920
is a deciding factor when you are going

364
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
for a drone frame is number of

365
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
propulsion system and this is a very

366
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,920
interesting uh

367
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,959
thing to know that uh why i would want

368
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,079
my drone to have

369
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,760
three motors or four motors or six

370
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,880
motors and what are different

371
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,120
characteristics of each motor so

372
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
right now i want you to forget that

373
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,560
thing where i talk about that drone is a

374
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,160
quadcopter and uh

375
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,040
just uh let's come back to that after

376
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,519
this

377
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,600
particular slide or or this particular

378
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,120
set of slides so

379
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,560
what is the propulsion system so a motor

380
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,920
and a propeller together from a

381
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,000
propulsion system which is actually

382
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,399
uh producing thrust for a drone so if

383
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,240
you talk about a tricopter it has a

384
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,760
three propulsion system that is it has

385
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,800
three motors so

386
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,880
you can see a tricopter by the name it

387
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,240
has three motors and

388
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,200
each motors on one arm so these motors

389
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
can speed up and speed down uh to give

390
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,800
its role and pitch access but but

391
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,600
what about the u-axis so we have seen in

392
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
the last uh

393
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,959
in the last class that to have a yaw

394
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,639
motion you need to

395
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,399
vary the speed of a diagonal motor but

396
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
this is having an odd number of motors

397
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,519
so how the

398
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,240
tricopter is able to your on on the

399
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,920
degree of freedom of your axis so the

400
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
answer lies in its tail so the design of

401
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,519
the tail is such that this

402
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,680
motor is mounted on a servo motor and

403
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,360
that servo motor rotates to give

404
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,920
its thrust in a particular direction and

405
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,440
we discuss about thrust vectoring in the

406
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,000
last

407
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,480
class so that is exactly how a tricopter

408
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,440
uh do its

409
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,240
your motion so let me find a quick video

410
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,720
for you

411
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,800
and where you can see that how tricopter

412
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,240
does the yaw motion and it's very

413
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,519
interesting to see

414
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,920
if you have not seen tricopter before so

415
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,120
let's see

416
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,480
so i am not having the top-notch

417
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,399
workstation so there might be some frame

418
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,839
drops i believe in the last video i've

419
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,839
seen some frame drops so

420
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,600
i'll try to mention these videos in the

421
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,680
hackaday uh project page so you can

422
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,160
refer it later so

423
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,639
let's see if we can find so tricopter

424
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,639
tail servo your motion

425
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,839
i just need to show you a couple of

426
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,519
seconds so you'll get the idea of how a

427
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,720
tricopter do

428
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,760
your so i'm

429
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,680
i'm getting some frame drops already so

430
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,959
apologies for that

431
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,079
but this is the best we can do so let's

432
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,199
see if we can find that video

433
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,240
okay so i think this is the one so you

434
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,279
can see that the

435
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,079
tail of the tricopter motor is mounted

436
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,040
on a yaw

437
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,760
mechanism on a servo mechanism where a

438
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
servo motor controls the direction

439
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,279
i'll mute this one so this is how

440
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,440
the assembly is being done and apologies

441
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,079
for the frame drop so

442
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,000
this is showing this entire assembly and

443
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,160
we are more interested in the working

444
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,399
so let's skip here i think this should

445
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,480
wait so yes that's the servo motor and

446
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,240
that is how the brushless dc motor the

447
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,160
bldc motors are used on drones are being

448
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,120
mounted

449
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,600
so now you can see that the servo has a

450
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,199
property that it can rotate from 0 to

451
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,639
180 degree and using that

452
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,720
it will do some thrust vectoring so how

453
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,560
tricopter servo works so

454
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
this video will clear the doubt how the

455
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
tricopter even though having odd number

456
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,600
of motors

457
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,519
is still able to yaw

458
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,519
so this is a tricopter frame and yes

459
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,040
there you can see

460
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,560
okay there you can see that how the

461
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,720
motor is continuously being changing the

462
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,519
direction

463
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,199
with the help of servo motor to keep it

464
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,279
stable even though having an odd number

465
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,880
of motors so that's exactly how a

466
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,839
tricopter

467
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,600
do your degree of freedom in 3d space

468
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,760
so engineering is fantastic and

469
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,360
tricopters are really good

470
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,720
so the question arises then why

471
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,560
do someone would want to build a

472
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,079
tricopter so

473
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,560
i wanted to see here so see this angle

474
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
between these two motors at the back so

475
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,160
this angle is so

476
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,480
much that there is no obstruction you

477
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,399
can mount anything here you can mount a

478
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,720
spray you can mount a camera

479
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,160
and there will be no obstruction from

480
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,680
this propellers because this is a very

481
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,279
very wide angle if you look here it's

482
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,279
more than 100 degrees so

483
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,720
this motor goes here this motor goes

484
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,399
there and still you have a lot of

485
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,560
angle you have a lot of clearance here

486
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,240
because of this clearance you can mount

487
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,279
a camera here

488
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,440
no propellers will come into into the

489
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,399
into the picture

490
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,800
you can mount a jet spray here and even

491
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,480
in the in in the last

492
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,639
last class i show you one video of a

493
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,240
drone ambulance

494
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,160
made by some university in netherlands

495
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,680
they're also using a version of

496
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,600
tricopter it's basically y6 which will

497
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,040
also come to but they are using a

498
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,639
version of tricopter

499
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,800
because of very same reason because this

500
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,720
space they are using to mount a screen

501
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,920
and a camera to talk to

502
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,120
someone who is assisting the patient so

503
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,440
that is why tricopter are very uh very

504
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,199
much used in these kinds of applications

505
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,079
where you need this

506
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,839
big clearance and you will not find this

507
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,120
clearance in quadcopter

508
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,360
as we'll see in the next slide another

509
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,600
reason one would want to

510
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,240
want to build a tricopter is a cost

511
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,199
because

512
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,800
motors are expensive propellers and

513
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,480
esc's are expensive

514
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,880
so when you are having more number of

515
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,279
motors you might also want to

516
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,759
have more chances of failure so that is

517
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,959
why to

518
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,440
reduce the cost uh you can build a

519
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,720
tricopter

520
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,040
another reason that is i know a lot of

521
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,639
people have built tricopter in the past

522
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:30,880
is

523
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,800
the yaw authority as they used to call

524
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,079
it because

525
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,399
the your mechanism is not dependent on

526
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,079
the speeding up and speeding down of the

527
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,240
motors and it depends on

528
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,279
a mechanical assembly a servo assembly

529
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,279
which is a good servo motor a metal gear

530
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,440
servo motor so it gives a tricopter a

531
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,600
very good yaw control a very

532
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,240
very good your authority and you can do

533
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,880
very quick

534
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,959
your maneuvers and those who have

535
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,720
already fly drone they know that

536
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,920
yaw is one of the access which is really

537
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,560
important

538
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,800
in terms of flying in terms of handling

539
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,079
so that is why there could be another

540
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,679
reason to build a tricopter so

541
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,919
yes uh that is a reason if you want to

542
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,280
build a tricopter

543
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,439
and yes we spend a lot of time talking

544
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,199
about tricopters let's move to the next

545
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,599
slide and we'll talk about quadcopter so

546
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,039
the very first thing i want you to

547
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,559
notice is the angle which i'm talking

548
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,559
about so see how this angle reduces

549
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,319
compared to the tricopter it has this

550
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,720
uh very obtuse angle and in case of

551
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,039
quadcopter this angle is reduces so

552
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,440
uh the first disadvantage of quadcopter

553
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
is a very less clearance between

554
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,440
two arms or two propellers so if you are

555
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,360
about to mount a camera here

556
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,520
high chances these propellers will come

557
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,480
into the picture

558
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,880
and if you have not mounted it below or

559
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,720
up there are high chances if you have

560
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,919
mounted on the center line that

561
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,760
propellers will come into the picture

562
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,200
and again if you want to mount

563
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,520
something else like display or camera to

564
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,400
talk to

565
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,240
someone like the drone ambulance then

566
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,600
that may hinder

567
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,440
that decision okay but talking about

568
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,400
quadcopters

569
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,640
uh one thing which you can notice is

570
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
these two motors are marked blue because

571
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,160
these two motors spin clockwise and

572
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,000
these two motors spin anti-clockwise

573
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,440
which you already discussed in the in

574
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,960
the last uh

575
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,000
last class

576
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,320
so because of that it provides a very

577
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,000
good stability a very

578
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,720
uh very stable uh performance in the air

579
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,520
so quadcopter

580
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,120
really stable drones they are

581
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
not aerodynamically stable because they

582
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,799
don't have some airfoil or something

583
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,400
which are reducing drag which we have

584
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,440
already discussed

585
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,400
but because of these two anti-clockwise

586
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
and two clockwise spinning motors they

587
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,440
cancel each other out and they can be

588
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,880
very much stable and

589
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,400
if you have programmed it right if you

590
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
have tuned it right then quadcopter is

591
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,520
one of the most stable

592
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,799
drone frame which you can build so yes

593
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,039
uh another thing which you want to build

594
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,880
quadcopter compared to tricopter is uh

595
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
one motor will give you more one extra

596
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,720
motor will give you more power and we

597
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,320
talked about thrusters to waitress and

598
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,520
it's important so

599
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,039
obviously you will get more stability

600
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,840
than the tricopter

601
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,000
uh next let's talk about hexacopter and

602
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,360
as a name today it has six

603
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,440
motors so the question is we already

604
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,039
have tricopter we already have

605
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,160
quadcopter

606
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,760
most of the problems can be solved with

607
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,840
it then why someone would need to

608
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,160
build a hexacopter one of the major

609
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,120
reason people

610
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,919
in film industry are building hexacopter

611
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:18,240
is

612
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,480
uh so yes before that i'll let me tell

613
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
you that hexacopters are mainly being

614
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,799
used in film industry where people

615
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,000
wants to mount big cameras where people

616
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,720
want to

617
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,520
mount expensive cinema class cameras

618
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,200
there you'll find hexacopter

619
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,600
the very first reason they want to build

620
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,640
hexacopter is

621
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
more power so obviously you'll have two

622
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,080
extra motors that will give you

623
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,640
uh 2x more thrust compared to the

624
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,840
quadcopter

625
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,280
uh number three is redundancy and uh

626
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,039
hear me out and try to understand this

627
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,160
concept so

628
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,919
you can see there are three motors which

629
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,679
are rotating uh clockwise and three

630
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,760
motor which are rotating anti-clockwise

631
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,360
compared to quadcopter where there are

632
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,919
only two sets of one set of each

633
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,720
so if one of the motor or is two of the

634
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,600
motor fails

635
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,520
in a hexacopter you still have a

636
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,360
quadcopter uh setup and it

637
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,760
is still very stable so what i mean by

638
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,720
that is if you

639
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,919
let's say is mounting a fifty thousand

640
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,520
dollars camera which is uh

641
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,919
not uh which is uh like the cost of a

642
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,360
cinema camera

643
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,039
you want some kind of redundancy you

644
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,799
want some kind of fail safe you want

645
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,559
some kind of feature that protects its

646
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,120
uh if

647
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,799
one motor fails or two motor fields and

648
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,960
that is exactly what hexacopter provides

649
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,120
it provides redundancy if one of your

650
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,720
motor or two of your motor fails you

651
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,559
will still be able to land it without

652
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,760
any problem you will still

653
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,000
still be able to control it in the air

654
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,799
so that is

655
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,520
one of the major reason people who want

656
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,000
to

657
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
want to mount expensive gears on their

658
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,840
drones they prefer hexacopter over

659
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,960
quadcopter

660
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,320
similarly more redundancy more power so

661
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,880
yes if you're still not able to have

662
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,679
your

663
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,360
payload lifted with hexacopter then you

664
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,720
can add two more motors to get

665
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,159
octocopter and you'll get

666
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,760
another level another layer of

667
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,919
redundancy so

668
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,400
uh let's talk about some weird shapes

669
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
and it's y6 the same

670
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,559
we saw in the last class in the drone

671
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,400
ambulance so what exactly is happening

672
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,840
here so

673
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,080
you want you don't want to uh you don't

674
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,000
want to change your frame you don't want

675
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,280
to

676
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,840
add keep adding motors because at one

677
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,559
time you will

678
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,320
you will exhaust the available space and

679
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,480
you will not have enough clearance

680
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,760
between the propeller so if you talk

681
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,440
about hexacopter see there is very less

682
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,200
clearance between the propellers and

683
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,280
uh you are pro you are basically

684
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,559
exhausted the

685
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,000
space available to you and your

686
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,679
propellers cannot spin so what you will

687
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,320
do

688
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,080
so engineers have come up with great

689
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,840
ideas that instead of mount keep

690
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,760
mounting motors on one axis let's mount

691
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,640
motor on

692
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,480
the below axis so you have three motors

693
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,760
on the up and three motors

694
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,240
on the below so that is how our y6 work

695
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,600
it is basically

696
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,799
two tricopter uh attached back to back

697
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,760
one on the top and one on the bottom uh

698
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,039
when you have a y6

699
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,120
you'll see in the tricopter all motors

700
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,559
spinning in the same direction but in

701
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,240
the y6 there are

702
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,720
two sets of different motors spinning on

703
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,320
different direction which cancel out

704
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,760
each other and you don't need a servo

705
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,000
mechanism as a tricopter did

706
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,159
so in the similar way uh if you can

707
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,600
mount a motor downwards

708
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,440
why not mount four motors downwards and

709
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,679
get an x8 that is basically two

710
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,880
quadcopters

711
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,760
and similarly you can mix and match a

712
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,120
number of propulsion system

713
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,960
and you can get these kinds of frame

714
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,520
configuration so so far we talked about

715
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,240
the drone

716
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
size and the different shapes in which

717
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,679
you can make the drone okay now let's

718
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,120
move ahead and talk about

719
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,640
different materials that you can use to

720
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,320
build drone frames so

721
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,080
basically no one is stopping you to use

722
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,840
any kind of material to build the drone

723
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,120
you want

724
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,520
but there are certain materials that are

725
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,280
being used already by different

726
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,960
drone frame manufacturers by different

727
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
people around the world and

728
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,440
there are certain factors that are kept

729
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,080
into consideration while building or

730
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,400
buying a drone frame and i have listed

731
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,799
there in a table it's a cost durability

732
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,919
weight and signal interference so

733
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,600
as i already mentioned in the last class

734
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,200
that when you are

735
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,280
talking about drones everything is a

736
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,240
trade-off

737
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,840
you will gain something but you will

738
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,720
lose a couple of things and vice versa

739
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,320
that is why you need to find a sweet

740
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,720
spot you need to know on what particular

741
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,400
ground you want to compromise on and on

742
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,919
what particular ground you don't want to

743
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,880
compromise on

744
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,320
and i'll give you a very uh sweet

745
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,200
example what i meant by that so

746
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
let's suppose i am a drone racing pilot

747
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,559
and uh

748
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,880
i am flying drone at a very high speed

749
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,919
so what uh

750
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,799
can i give up there and what i cannot

751
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,080
give up there so

752
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,960
definitely i cannot give up on the

753
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,279
weight i want my weight to be as

754
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,840
low as possible that is the only way i

755
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,400
will

756
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,600
i will be able to attain higher speeds

757
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,679
i can give on the cost because i know

758
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,840
that if i'm participating in a drone uh

759
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,400
races uh people will come uh there as my

760
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,760
competitor with all kind of

761
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,720
uh drone frames with all uh best kind of

762
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,760
material and we

763
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,360
are basically competing for a price

764
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,120
money so cost is not

765
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,440
a factor there uh i cannot give up on

766
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,480
durability because

767
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,320
when you are racing uh you want your

768
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,919
frame to be durable uh

769
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,520
even if there are lighter crashes you

770
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,840
are able to make repairs and you are

771
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,320
ready for the next heat and so on so

772
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,520
this is a

773
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
an example i want to give and talk about

774
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
the sweet finding the sweet spot

775
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,720
so let's compare different materials so

776
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,400
on the left you can see that these are

777
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,159
the common materials which are being

778
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,880
used for making drones it's a wood uh

779
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,080
plastic composite

780
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,360
g10 or fiberglass or carbon fiber so

781
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,840
let's talk about wood so uh wood

782
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,279
basically cost very less

783
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,520
so there are different woods material

784
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,840
which are being used in making drones

785
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,240
i am not sure but i think pinewood is

786
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,679
one of them i have built

787
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,240
of a single or a couple of wood frames

788
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,880
in the past

789
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,600
mainly for tricopter and there i only

790
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,000
want

791
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,919
it to carry a gopro and don't do any

792
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,919
fast maneuvers like i do with my fpv

793
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:00,960
free cell drone

794
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,120
so that is why i am not concerned about

795
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,360
the durability so wood can break easily

796
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,200
but because it is so cheap you can

797
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,760
replace it with a new part so you can

798
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,240
carry extra extra parts with you you can

799
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,200
make replaces on the go so that is why

800
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,640
the cost of the wood is

801
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,480
very low and also the durability is also

802
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,679
very low you crash you

803
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
uh you'll break an arm or something uh i

804
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,240
also want to mention here that when i

805
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,000
talk about durability it's not only the

806
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,360
frame durability but

807
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
also the protection frame provided your

808
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,640
electronics so

809
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
uh basically what is a drone frame it is

810
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,559
nothing it is a house of all your drone

811
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,159
electronic components and if

812
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,080
the frame is not durable it will break

813
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,200
very easily

814
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
there are high chances that it will also

815
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,760
break your components so for example if

816
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,240
your drone arms break on the arms you

817
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,279
have mounted your esc there may be esc

818
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,120
wire breakage and because the battery is

819
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,440
connected there may be short circuit and

820
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,520
your entire electronics fry and the

821
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,440
magic white smoke comes out

822
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
and the possibilities are endless so do

823
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,520
also keep that in mind that durability

824
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,200
is not just the frame durability but

825
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,679
also

826
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,080
the the housing the shell it provides to

827
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,600
other components

828
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,000
uh talking about the weight that is a

829
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
big uh

830
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,799
factor for not choosing wood as an fpv

831
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,480
racing or a fe freestyle drone because

832
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,919
the wood is very heavy

833
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,760
and the heaviness of wood is not

834
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,320
suitable for such kind of application

835
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,360
but on uh one good uh end there is no

836
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,720
signal interference

837
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,880
with the wood wood is not conductive so

838
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,559
there is no signal interference and i

839
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,080
will talk about signal interference when

840
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,720
we will talk

841
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,240
about the other materials now let's talk

842
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,480
about plastic composite so

843
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,400
some drone manufacturers what they did

844
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,640
they are using some plastic polymers

845
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,360
which are very durable which are also

846
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,440
very lightweight i think abs is one of

847
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,080
them

848
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,400
uh there is a tpu which is also flexible

849
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,360
so it will

850
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,200
never break it's like flexible materials

851
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
you can never break them

852
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
so talking about plastic composite the

853
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,200
cost is it depends uh

854
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,520
on uh different frame manufacturers and

855
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,480
different

856
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,559
polymers which are being used in cost so

857
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,320
cannot really come in so if it's a high

858
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,279
quality plastic

859
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,440
composite it would cost more if it's a

860
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,360
low grade plastic polymer it will

861
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,840
cost less there are some plastic which

862
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,480
are mixed with

863
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,640
resin and something i i don't know i'm

864
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,679
not the best uh

865
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,640
best guy to comment on that but yes i'm

866
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,039
not

867
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,960
really sure the cost of the plastic it

868
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,679
would totally depend on the material

869
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,240
durability wise they are good so i have

870
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,120
seen

871
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,960
some plastic frames floating in the

872
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,200
market and even in drone racing

873
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,919
we are using plastics to enforce the

874
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,440
frame and the plastic i'm talking about

875
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:35,679
is

876
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,320
tpu it's a flexible plastic so it

877
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,760
doesn't break and

878
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,440
yes they are being used and they are

879
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,360
quite durable so that is a good uh

880
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,679
thing with the plastic composite on the

881
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,200
weight side i cannot really comment it

882
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,279
depends on the density so

883
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,200
these frames are generally injection

884
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,480
molded uh

885
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,039
you may also find some 3d printable

886
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,559
frames but i'm not talking about them

887
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,000
particularly here i'm talking about

888
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,520
injection molded frame

889
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,679
so how much dense they are the density

890
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,720
of the material that

891
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,039
will totally uh dictate the weight of

892
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:05,840
this frame so i

893
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,799
uh so i've left that particular section

894
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,320
on the signal interference again

895
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,760
plastics are not

896
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,279
conductive so there is no signal

897
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,440
interference so that is a good thing

898
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,000
i have marked data red cross but that is

899
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,520
actually a good thing there is no signal

900
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,480
interference

901
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,760
that's what i mean by the red cross okay

902
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,159
so

903
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,240
moving ahead there is another material

904
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,279
which uh

905
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,279
is being used in making drone frame it's

906
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,399
quite

907
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,320
popular a couple of years back because

908
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
it's relatively cheaper than carbon

909
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,880
fiber and it's

910
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,080
g10 so compared to wood and plastic

911
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,360
composite it definitely

912
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,000
uh expensive than that but it is far

913
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
less expensive than carbon fiber

914
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,880
durability wise it totally depends on

915
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,039
the manufacturing process so what a g10

916
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,120
is it basically a sheet of fiberglass

917
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,679
and they are

918
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,039
sandwiched together and they are

919
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,039
they are pasted using epoxy and the

920
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,120
density of epoxy the quality of

921
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,440
resins used to make that epoxy and so on

922
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,039
uh that detects a durability so i've

923
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,000
left that one

924
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,120
uh the weight is uh very high it's so

925
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,760
it's

926
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
quite heavy compared to the carbon fiber

927
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,080
so that is a downside of it

928
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,640
signal interference again fiber glass is

929
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,200
not

930
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,919
conductive out of the box so there is no

931
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,080
much signal interference

932
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,559
now let's talk about carbon fiber the

933
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,440
most

934
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,480
famous the most favorite material of

935
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,120
building drones these days the cost is

936
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,559
extremely high

937
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,640
carbon fiber is really expensive and to

938
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,559
make to find good carbon fiber it's also

939
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,240
not an easy task and

940
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
what is basically a carbon fiber is it's

941
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,080
the fibers of

942
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,480
graphite and some other carbon composite

943
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,159
material and they are

944
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,919
made in a sheet sandwiched together

945
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,919
again again

946
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,440
stacked together and paste using epoxy

947
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,679
on the durability side they are very

948
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,440
very durable carbon fiber is one of the

949
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,399
most

950
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,720
durable component sorry durable material

951
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,520
which you can use to build drones and

952
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,320
depending on how you post process or how

953
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,039
you

954
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,279
do some kind of things before making

955
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,520
drone it can be more durable

956
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,799
for example uh what we as a drone

957
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,279
builder as a drone pilot do is we

958
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,279
chamfer the edges using a very

959
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,399
uh very high grade file and then we put

960
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,200
some

961
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,279
super glue on the edges and that gives

962
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,039
extreme durability even in crashes so

963
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,880
carbon fiber is extremely durable

964
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,799
a weight side is also good it's not very

965
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,559
heavy compared to g10

966
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,960
and wood it's a quite lightweight so

967
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,080
that is why it's also

968
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,960
another favorable thing so everything is

969
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,480
good in carbon fiber so what's wrong so

970
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,000
the wrong part is signal interference

971
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,760
because the carbon the graphite

972
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,720
is a conductive material and when you

973
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,840
are talking about

974
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,240
frequency we on the drone we have 2.4

975
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,159
gigahertz for our ceiling we have 5.8

976
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,679
gigahertz for video link

977
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,960
so carbon fiber if

978
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,120
so basically uh consider it like this so

979
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,799
carbon fiber is conductive but

980
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,799
uh the epoxy and the the coating of

981
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,480
the layer on the top and the bottom that

982
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,320
is non-conductive so

983
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
out of the box the frame you will get

984
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,559
that will not conduct electricity

985
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,880
but after some time when you are

986
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,559
crashing when you are

987
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,399
getting rid of that particular coating

988
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,000
on the top and on the bottom

989
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,840
the conductive parts the fiber of the

990
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
carbons they start appearing up and that

991
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,399
is

992
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,600
conductive in nature that can that can

993
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,120
do some short circuit if there is some

994
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,799
voltage leaking on the drone and that is

995
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,320
the major part which is

996
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,640
responsible for signal interference so

997
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,159
signal interference happens in the

998
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,120
carbon fiber if

999
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,480
the frame is not maintained uh so

1000
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,399
what could be the best of this both

1001
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,559
worlds so in the engineering everywhere

1002
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,200
we are seeing that uh the engineers the

1003
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,000
manufacturer

1004
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,360
they take some good part of this world

1005
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,720
they say some good part of this world

1006
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,159
and they come together

1007
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,960
so i'll show you my drone frame so i'll

1008
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,519
quickly

1009
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,159
uh go to this overhead camera and you

1010
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,360
can see this is the drone frame which

1011
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,640
i'm using so

1012
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,960
carbon fiber very lightweight very

1013
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,640
durable there is signal interference but

1014
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,159
that's okay unless uh you are

1015
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,000
maintaining a frame there is no problem

1016
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,320
but carbon fiber is also soft at some

1017
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,840
points and they can break

1018
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,120
they can uh they can they can get

1019
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,039
they can get worn out over the period of

1020
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,799
time and what these manufacturers are

1021
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,320
doing they are they are using metal

1022
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,039
parts

1023
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,480
so you can see here this is a 70 75

1024
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,440
aerospace grid alumin aluminum and this

1025
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,120
is being used to enforce the carbon so

1026
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,720
this is the best of the both world

1027
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,279
i'm getting a metal where it is

1028
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,000
necessary

1029
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,600
and carbon fiber on the rest of this

1030
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,080
place so why we cannot make the frame of

1031
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,840
this metal and why there is no metal on

1032
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,880
my slide

1033
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,799
that is because the metal is quite heavy

1034
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,159
and that is not a suitable thing and

1035
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,760
metal is conductive as well

1036
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,679
so any leakage can cause short circuit

1037
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,919
so but the best of the both world is

1038
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:48,960
carbon fiber

1039
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,919
uh with aerospace aluminum which will

1040
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,640
give its

1041
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
durability where it is necessary so

1042
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,720
there is a front end collision

1043
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,960
the aluminum will protect it otherwise

1044
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,720
the lightweight of carbon fiber is

1045
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,679
a goodness so that is how the frame

1046
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,039
manufacturers are coming up with the

1047
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,720
best of the both world and

1048
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,120
i think that is a way ahead all right so

1049
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,000
let's talk about

1050
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,760
uh the quadcopter variants in drone

1051
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,840
frame and i want you to come back to

1052
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,399
that

1053
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,399
same thought process that whenever

1054
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,679
whenever i'm saying drone

1055
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,760
you think about quadcopter the drone

1056
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,919
frame with four motors

1057
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,679
so before that let's talk about

1058
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,279
different thing that changed the flying

1059
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,039
characteristics and the first thing is

1060
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,640
center of gravity so

1061
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,039
uh the center of gravity is the

1062
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,320
balancing point of

1063
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,559
any body and the drones are no different

1064
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,399
uh they balance at a particular point

1065
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:36,960
where

1066
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,080
uh they have equal amount of balance

1067
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,039
in all uh direction in 3d space so uh

1068
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,080
center of gravity

1069
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,039
if it changes because of external part

1070
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:47,519
like

1071
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,919
battery is one of the uh one of the

1072
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,360
component of drone which carries

1073
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,000
most of the weight so you can change the

1074
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,919
center of gravity of point by changing

1075
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,679
the position of gravity uh changing the

1076
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:58,799
position of battery

1077
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,159
uh in the drone so that changes the

1078
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,399
flying characteristics how your drone

1079
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,919
is flying so other thing is uh if

1080
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,399
uh your drone frame has less material

1081
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,918
overall compared to

1082
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,159
another frame which has uh thicker arms

1083
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,918
if your if your drone frame has thinner

1084
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:16,800
arms and so on

1085
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,719
that would have less drag and we

1086
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,079
discussed that in the last class

1087
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,119
that uh the shape of the uh the shape

1088
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,560
of the material and the amount of the

1089
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,399
material which is exposed to a fluid

1090
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,560
that contributes to the drag so

1091
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,639
uh less material your drone frame have

1092
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,399
less drag it would have

1093
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,560
uh this is the most important part that

1094
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,000
is the better balance is

1095
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,399
less work for flight controller so uh in

1096
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,719
the last class we discussed that

1097
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,040
aerodynamically drones are unstable they

1098
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,280
rely on sensors they rely on

1099
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,760
on-board computers to maintain a balance

1100
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
to maintain a stable flight

1101
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,119
so if your center of gravity is off if

1102
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,599
your drone frame is not perfectly

1103
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,239
balanced

1104
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,200
so more work has to be done by flight

1105
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,680
controller to keep it balanced so

1106
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,640
let's say if i move to the overhead

1107
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,280
camera to show you

1108
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,320
let's say this is your drone frame

1109
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,160
and your center of gravity needs to be

1110
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,920
at the center so all the motors are

1111
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,040
doing equal part

1112
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,320
but for some reason the frame

1113
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,240
manufacturer was incompetent and they

1114
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,280
designed the

1115
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,119
frame such that the balance is at the

1116
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,480
back so

1117
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,160
uh ideally your drone would always be

1118
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,839
flying tilted this way

1119
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,760
so what your flight control have to do

1120
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,240
is always instruct this motor to spin

1121
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,640
relatively at higher rpm than these two

1122
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,280
motors

1123
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,599
so that the drone can stay at balance so

1124
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,800
what is happening here your flight

1125
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,480
controller have to do more work

1126
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,520
uh your one set of motor needs to do

1127
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,359
more work and that is a lot of work and

1128
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,280
that is a lot of computation so overall

1129
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
you will get

1130
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,000
a very less adequate performance from

1131
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,839
your drone so that is also

1132
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,440
uh an intuitive unsaid thing

1133
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,680
that goes inside when choosing a drone

1134
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,880
frame so

1135
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,560
better balance a better center of

1136
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,359
gravity less material that all accounts

1137
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,480
to a good quadcopter frame

1138
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,960
so these are all the variants of where

1139
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,800
you can find different quadcopter frames

1140
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,000
so i have listed that

1141
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,599
on the left and on the right you can see

1142
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,040
their photos so we have

1143
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,240
a x type quadcopter also known as

1144
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,520
true x then we have h type then we have

1145
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,680
hybrid x i'm sorry it's not hybrid c

1146
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,200
it's hybrid x

1147
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,040
then we have stretched x and then we

1148
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,119
have dead cat so this is the true

1149
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,920
x frame which is in the shape of x or

1150
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,800
across

1151
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,119
uh this is a h where it's in the shape

1152
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:35,839
of the edge

1153
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,760
so you can see there are four motors on

1154
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
all these but the arrangement is quite

1155
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,560
different

1156
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,599
it's x here it's h here uh this

1157
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,680
is a stretched x where you can see this

1158
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,839
angle is more compared to this angle

1159
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,000
while on the true x these are the

1160
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,440
distance between these two motors and

1161
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,040
these two motors are same

1162
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,720
whereas in stressed extra distance

1163
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,160
between these two motors is higher

1164
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,839
compared to these two motors

1165
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,079
then you you take the h you take the x

1166
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,839
and you'll get you'll end up with hybrid

1167
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,920
x and square is also another kind of

1168
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,880
frame

1169
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,000
uh another special kind of quadcopter

1170
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
is a dead cat as you can see here where

1171
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,200
the angle uh

1172
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,119
in the front two arms is greater than

1173
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,040
compared to the back two arms so

1174
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,920
uh let's talk about all these frames so

1175
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,400
again

1176
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,920
center of gravity uh on all these frames

1177
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,520
the x type the edge type

1178
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,760
is different and we have discussed that

1179
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,680
because of center of gravity there is a

1180
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,359
different in flying characteristics and

1181
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,320
we'll talk about that

1182
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,800
in a bit uh less material is equal to

1183
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,560
less drag and that is why you can see

1184
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,119
this small quadcopter here it's called a

1185
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,280
toothpick drone because it has very very

1186
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,599
thin

1187
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,839
arms a very very thin surface area

1188
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,119
exposed to the air

1189
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,880
and this can go up to very high speed

1190
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,119
because of lesser drag so

1191
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,119
this point holds valid in these kinds of

1192
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,280
frame uh better balance is equal to less

1193
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,640
work of flight control as we already

1194
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,520
discussed so

1195
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,000
uh in in the x there is a very good

1196
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,520
balance because so the distance between

1197
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,880
these two motors and these two motors

1198
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,680
are same

1199
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,000
so there is very less computation this

1200
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,119
flat node will have to do

1201
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,320
whereas in something like h or the

1202
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,599
hybrid x it's it's

1203
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,280
it's quite different and the center of

1204
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,520
gravity and balance is a bit off

1205
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,440
especially in the in the dead cat as you

1206
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,119
can see there is a

1207
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,640
shift in the center of gravity because

1208
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
of different angles of back and the

1209
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,520
front arms

1210
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,839
so flat controller has to do more work

1211
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,839
but the question is uh

1212
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,520
why would anyone wants to choose these

1213
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,359
kinds of uh different

1214
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,280
different quadcopters all these are

1215
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,680
quadcopters all these are four motors

1216
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,280
we discussed that they are a tricopter

1217
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,800
hexacopter but now uh

1218
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,000
why quadcopters in different

1219
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,920
configuration so

1220
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,119
consider the truex that is one of the

1221
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,359
most stable quadcopter the

1222
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,400
most balanced quadcopter so that is why

1223
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,920
if you're looking for stability you can

1224
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,320
go with that but the downside is look at

1225
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,079
the space in the center there is very

1226
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,760
less space you will get to mount your

1227
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,880
electronics

1228
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,280
uh you cannot fit everything in the x

1229
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,200
frame that is why

1230
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,880
the drone manufacturers the frame

1231
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,560
manufacturers they go for the edge

1232
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,400
configuration there you can see you get

1233
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,119
this bus

1234
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,119
like structure in the center where you

1235
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,119
can put your gps your flight controller

1236
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,880
your video transmitter and antennas and

1237
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,640
so on

1238
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,280
uh when you want uh the stability of an

1239
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,359
x and you want the space like h then you

1240
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,200
go for the hybrid x where

1241
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,960
the balance is like the x the stability

1242
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,599
is like the x but you also

1243
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,040
get more space to put all your

1244
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
electronics but the downside is

1245
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,760
then this will have more area exposed

1246
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,720
and it will have more

1247
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,880
drag so again i mentioned that

1248
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,480
everything is a trade-off for when you

1249
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,839
are building such things so you need to

1250
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,359
find your sweet spot

1251
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,560
uh the uh the need for stretch x is

1252
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,640
uh so when we are racing so stretch x

1253
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,480
are recently uh very common

1254
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,040
these days because of drone racing uh so

1255
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,000
because of this

1256
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,079
weird distance between uh two set of

1257
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,960
motor uh this stressed x kind of drones

1258
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,440
are

1259
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,400
very very agile very very maneuverable

1260
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,119
in uh

1261
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,400
in close turns and and in any proximity

1262
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
flying kind of situation

1263
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,640
uh so remember in the last uh in the in

1264
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,119
the last

1265
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,560
video we talked about the uh how jet

1266
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,800
jet airplanes are using instability

1267
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,680
design

1268
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,920
as as their advantage for their

1269
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,720
advantage

1270
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,200
similarly stretched eggs because the

1271
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,960
balance is off

1272
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,319
the air the air will not compensate for

1273
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,000
its stability they will not provide for

1274
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,160
stability so it can use this instability

1275
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,079
for its advantage and get high

1276
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,800
uh maneuverability high agility and it's

1277
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,520
very easy

1278
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,680
uh in the in the shop turns for pilot

1279
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,359
and the turns are very hard

1280
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,599
when you're drone racing so stretched x

1281
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,640
frame especially

1282
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,800
are used by drone racers for the agility

1283
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,760
purposes

1284
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,960
uh now similarly uh if you if you see

1285
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,359
the dead cat configuration of quadcopter

1286
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,760
see how the arms are in different angles

1287
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,960
so 70 degree

1288
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,040
of uh angle between the front two arms

1289
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,240
and almost

1290
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,319
50 50 degree in the back to arm so why

1291
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,440
is that uh

1292
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,280
do you notice the small camera here so

1293
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,720
that is the reason remember when i

1294
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,400
talked about the quadcopter i mentioned

1295
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,119
that

1296
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,319
the quadcopter is not like tricopter

1297
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,680
where you will get a very

1298
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,680
uh very very good angle in the front so

1299
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,280
you can mount oreo all your cameras and

1300
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,640
the propellers will not come into

1301
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,359
picture

1302
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,079
uh well guess someone has a solution so

1303
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,119
what they did they

1304
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,520
they make the front front angle a bit

1305
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,520
more steeper so you can mount this gopro

1306
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,720
like cameras and still not get

1307
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,000
propellers into picture

1308
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,599
but the downside is you will lose some

1309
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,000
stability it's not a perfectly x

1310
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,400
the center of gravity is way off and the

1311
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,920
flight controller will have to do more

1312
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,400
work

1313
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,960
you it's it's very you will have a very

1314
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,119
hard time tuning it or

1315
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,680
making it stable so that is overall

1316
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,280
trade-off so you need to decide

1317
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,240
uh talking about me i i fly uh this kind

1318
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,720
of configuration hybrid x or

1319
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,280
edge kind of for quadcopters more uh but

1320
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,920
these days

1321
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,760
people are shifting to truex and stretch

1322
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,200
because of stability and

1323
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,680
uh the components are getting smaller

1324
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,400
and smaller

1325
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,160
uh the receivers were used to be very

1326
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,839
big a couple of years back

1327
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,319
they are comparatively smaller these

1328
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:02,960
days so

1329
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,520
you can fit a lot of parts in this small

1330
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,480
area so

1331
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,079
people are making a shift but again you

1332
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,599
need to decide for your own particular

1333
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,160
application

1334
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,359
okay so here is another table which i

1335
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,280
created so on the left you can see

1336
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,839
uh different drone configuration and on

1337
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,440
the right on the columns you'll see

1338
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,079
space

1339
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,560
stability agility durability and field

1340
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,440
of view

1341
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,359
so talking about a true x frame there is

1342
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,480
very less space

1343
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,520
but the stability is very high agility

1344
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,640
is also high

1345
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,920
durability again uh depends on how good

1346
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,560
the frame

1347
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,920
uh manufacturer has provided to keep the

1348
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,119
electronics safe

1349
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,040
field of view you don't get a good field

1350
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,040
of view because the propellers are

1351
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
very close to each other each other in

1352
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,960
the true edge everything is good except

1353
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,000
for agility

1354
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,079
uh because its center of gravity is

1355
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,119
again off so

1356
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,480
more work has to be done by flight

1357
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,720
controllers and motors to keep it stable

1358
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,760
and there you lose the agility uh hybrid

1359
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,079
x

1360
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,839
uh uh this one the frame which i use

1361
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,319
the fpv drone pilots and freestyle

1362
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,839
pilots and race pilot use it's

1363
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,560
good in every department uh stretched x

1364
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,000
again there's a space issue but

1365
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,119
again it's good that cat you will you

1366
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,960
get a very good field of view but uh

1367
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,480
you have to compromise with stability

1368
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,200
and agility

1369
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,560
uh so a small a word about drone frame

1370
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,880
assembly so every drone has

1371
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,599
a different uh structure every drone has

1372
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,200
a different structural component and

1373
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,079
different

1374
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,240
physical components and you need to

1375
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,079
consult the manufacturer you need to

1376
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,280
consult

1377
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,520
some documentation which comes with it

1378
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,880
to assemble it and

1379
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,599
if you are diying your own drone frame

1380
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,280
then you know what to do but uh

1381
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,839
let's uh shift to an overhead camera and

1382
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,400
i'll

1383
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,960
show you what i'm talking about so this

1384
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,680
frame particularly comes with a single

1385
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,079
bottom plate and a top plate and this

1386
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,200
particular part

1387
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,359
you need to assemble using the screw

1388
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,280
this frame is comparatively very easy to

1389
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,040
assemble it just one bottom

1390
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,319
part and a top part there are some

1391
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,480
another unassembled frames i have

1392
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,319
which are mostly used for drone racing

1393
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,079
so this is one frame designed by my

1394
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:12,880
friend

1395
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,359
so this has a dual arms like structure

1396
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,280
so you will get two arms in one

1397
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,319
body you have a bottom plate and then

1398
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:20,640
you

1399
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,079
put some standoff and then you have a

1400
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,640
top plate so what i'm trying to

1401
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,680
say is that every frame is different and

1402
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,200
when assembling a frame you need to

1403
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,000
consult the manufacturer documentation

1404
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,440
and if any chance if you are building

1405
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,760
your own frame like a lot of people do

1406
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,040
then you know what you are doing so

1407
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,839
that concludes the drone frame selection

1408
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:42,800
uh

1409
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,680
part of this particular class and as i

1410
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,280
already mentioned the first class i'm

1411
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,960
i'm not going to recommend one

1412
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,680
particular kind of frame or any part

1413
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,760
so you know what best your application

1414
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,599
is but i can surely show you what i

1415
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,720
use so i use this armeton chameleon

1416
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,720
frame which is a very good frame

1417
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,640
and our milton is a good frame

1418
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,400
manufacturer this comes with a lifetime

1419
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,119
warranty

1420
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,119
uh i'm not sponsored by admittance or

1421
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,280
anything but that is just what i use so

1422
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,160
if you are interested

1423
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,480
into that okay so now moving to the next

1424
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,640
part of this class and this is very

1425
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,599
interesting and

1426
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,119
a lot of things we need to discuss so

1427
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,040
let's quickly talk about transmitters

1428
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,480
and receivers and

1429
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,200
let me show you how that looks so here

1430
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:25,839
is my

1431
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,480
transmitter and transmitter is your best

1432
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,200
friend in the hobby and

1433
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,359
when i say best friend it i mean that

1434
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,040
this is the one thing where

1435
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,720
i will not recommend anyone to

1436
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,040
compromise uh you can compromise on

1437
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,960
drone frame you can compromise on other

1438
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,960
components you can buy cheap one but

1439
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,599
never buy a cheap transmitter never

1440
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,599
compromise on the transmitter please go

1441
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:48,480
for

1442
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,160
at least a good transmitter like this

1443
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,680
one this is the fr squared

1444
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,720
on s9d plus a bit expensive transmitter

1445
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,160
but there are also some cheaper version

1446
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,599
from the same company like

1447
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,200
f sky q x7 there are also some

1448
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,280
more cheaper one by other cheap

1449
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,280
companies but i will not recommend that

1450
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,839
because this is the something which is

1451
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,119
going to be your best friend you are

1452
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,880
using this to control your drone

1453
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,640
this is where the signal is coming from

1454
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,079
and if you lose the signal you will lose

1455
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:14,640
the drone

1456
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,400
you will put people life into danger so

1457
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,839
that is why never compromise with

1458
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:18,960
transmitter

1459
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,400
so let's talk about the communication

1460
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,079
link so transmitter

1461
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,240
is the remote of your drone uh

1462
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,200
transmitter is

1463
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,720
the part which you are keeping in your

1464
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,240
hand to control the drone

1465
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,000
of course if you are trying to make an

1466
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,680
autonomous drone then you don't need a

1467
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,119
transmitter but again

1468
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,200
there are some cases even in autonomous

1469
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,040
zone where you need transmitter to feed

1470
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,880
one time information or so

1471
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,440
so transmitter is the remote which you

1472
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,960
keep in hand which you use to control

1473
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,920
your drone

1474
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,160
receiver on the other hand is the

1475
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,920
component which stays on your drone

1476
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,319
which

1477
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,480
receives the command the input from the

1478
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,440
transmitter

1479
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,640
about uh the roll pitch your access the

1480
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,920
throttle and

1481
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,400
how you wanted drone to react so this

1482
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,760
stays in the drone

1483
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,000
and they communicate together over a

1484
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,160
radio frequency link so they work on

1485
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,440
radio frequency

1486
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,920
uh rf channel if you are not familiar

1487
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,800
with the rf

1488
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,839
frequency it's basically electromagnetic

1489
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,920
electromagnetic carrier waves which

1490
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,280
carry information

1491
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,119
what kind of information so it carries

1492
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,359
in this case it carries inform

1493
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,480
information of a role pitch yaw and

1494
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,040
throttle

1495
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,200
how much yaw you want how much a degree

1496
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,119
per second of roll you want

1497
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,520
how much throttle you want your drone

1498
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,400
and what's the

1499
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,000
overall attitude you want your drone to

1500
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,400
behave

1501
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,480
so uh talking about the communication

1502
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,720
link the uh transmitters and receivers

1503
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,359
generally work on ism band that is a 2.4

1504
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,480
gigahertz so

1505
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,720
there is a frequency band available

1506
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,400
which are free to use around the world

1507
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,160
it's called ism band

1508
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,640
your routers work on that wi-fi or

1509
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,240
bluetooth works on that and a lot of

1510
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:54,640
different

1511
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,960
uh things which uh do not require any

1512
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,319
license work on that

1513
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,440
so again uh 2.4 gigahertz is a ism band

1514
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,000
and if you are using the ism band in a

1515
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,680
in a restrict power levels then you are

1516
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,680
free to use without any license

1517
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,000
uh for example uh in india where i come

1518
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,440
from if you are using

1519
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,800
other frequencies which are not a part

1520
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,040
of ism band then you need a ham license

1521
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,480
then you need a

1522
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,559
special permission from communication

1523
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,000
ministry of the government to do

1524
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,920
any uh any communication on that

1525
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,240
frequency but 2.4 gigahertz under a

1526
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:24,720
certain

1527
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,119
uh power range is free to use and yes

1528
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,200
these transmitters have uh

1529
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,440
have a power on which this transmits the

1530
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,240
signal

1531
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,119
if i talk about the uh radio transmitter

1532
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,640
which are used in drones and

1533
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,280
rc hobby the general uh transmitting

1534
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,520
power it's around 10 to 15 milliwatt and

1535
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,200
that gives you a range of around one

1536
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,400
kilometers in a good

1537
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,559
line of sight open space which is good

1538
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,079
enough and we'll also talk about how to

1539
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,520
increase that and stuff like that in

1540
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,160
later slides

1541
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,880
okay so uh one question which could

1542
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,000
arise is uh

1543
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,480
uh i want uh to fly with my friends we

1544
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,240
have 10 friends and we all have drones

1545
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,680
we want to fly together

1546
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,440
will there be any interference and that

1547
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,800
is a really good question

1548
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,280
and to answer that it it's it's not uh

1549
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,960
there will be no interference

1550
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,880
but how is that possible when everyone

1551
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,640
is flying on the same frequency

1552
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,640
so the answers lies in a thing called

1553
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,000
frequency hopping and what

1554
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,160
frequency hopping means that the

1555
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,839
transmitter and receiver

1556
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,839
they decide that we will be keep on

1557
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,280
changing frequencies uh

1558
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,720
every a certain time and we will know uh

1559
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,240
we are hopping from one frequency to

1560
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,240
another at the same time so we can

1561
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,520
communicate and this

1562
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,839
uh frequency hopping allows a lot of

1563
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,599
pilots to fly together they allow

1564
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,680
a lot of people to use fame same

1565
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,000
frequency without interfere interfering

1566
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,720
one another

1567
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,440
and there is a very very very steep very

1568
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,960
less chances that you will end up

1569
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,359
interfering with some other but that is

1570
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,760
not really the case that i have seen uh

1571
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,079
in big rc events around 200 people

1572
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,000
flying together without any problem

1573
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,880
and that is how frequency hopping work

1574
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,000
so frequency hopping

1575
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,839
is uh built into the transmitter and

1576
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,599
receiver and when you bind the receiver

1577
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,720
with your transmitter

1578
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,800
they agree on the algorithm used for

1579
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,160
frequency hopping

1580
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,319
and that allows a lot of pilots to fly

1581
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,720
together

1582
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,119
so 2.4 gigahertz i told you is the ism

1583
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,079
bandwidth this uh

1584
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,000
radio uses but you can also use 900

1585
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,160
megahertz and 423 megahertz depending on

1586
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,599
where you are in the world

1587
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,079
or if you are allowed to do that you can

1588
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,280
also extend the

1589
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,119
capabilities of this transmitter which

1590
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,960
we'll also talk about in later slides

1591
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,720
frequency limits as per local

1592
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,480
transmission loss so that holds true for

1593
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,839
everywhere in this world so government

1594
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:34,480
controls

1595
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,760
what frequencies you can use what

1596
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,440
frequencies you cannot use what power

1597
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,960
levels you use so

1598
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,800
please consult your local radio

1599
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,480
transmission laws before

1600
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,720
doing anything which may land you in

1601
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,559
problem like illegal transmission on

1602
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,040
illegal frequencies

1603
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,280
uh might need a ham license to transmit

1604
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,880
certain frequencies that holds again

1605
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,319
true if you want to do some

1606
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,079
frequency related stuff you want to

1607
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:57,920
transmit in some certain frequencies

1608
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,359
you might need to apply for a ham

1609
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,440
license and generally you need to give a

1610
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,640
test you need to

1611
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,960
give a test on electronics and antennas

1612
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,160
and

1613
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,920
radio frequency to get this ham license

1614
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,240
so uh if you are serious in this hobby

1615
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,520
and you want to continue pursuing it

1616
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,800
it's also a good idea to take that

1617
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,359
license as well

1618
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:16,960
power of transmission is also limited by

1619
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,480
local laws as i mentioned that these

1620
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,160
transmitter they work on 10 to 25

1621
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:20,960
milliwatt

1622
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,800
which is good enough it will give you a

1623
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,119
range of around one kilometer on or one

1624
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,640
mile depending on what is the power

1625
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,440
level

1626
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,359
and that is a good enough range

1627
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,880
range depends on a lot of different

1628
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,040
factors which we will also

1629
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,119
be talking about in great details but

1630
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:38,240
one such factor is

1631
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,680
like uh how dense uh in an area you are

1632
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,720
flying so

1633
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,079
if you are flying in an area with a lot

1634
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,160
of buildings lot of concrete walls then

1635
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,520
you will obviously have less range

1636
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,040
compared to if you are flying in open

1637
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,280
space where you have good line of sight

1638
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,839
for your drone and such kind of things

1639
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,680
and also where your antenna is facing at

1640
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,520
a particular time and what is the

1641
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,440
direction of receiver antenna that also

1642
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,359
matters a lot so we'll talk about that

1643
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:05,200
in coming slides now let's talk about

1644
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,319
the frequency

1645
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,680
uh rf power data rate and range so

1646
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,720
uh when i when i was teaching uh about

1647
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,839
drones in my

1648
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,880
in my local area to my students

1649
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,640
there is a common misconception and that

1650
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,160
misconception is that

1651
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,720
more the frequency more is the range so

1652
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,640
they think that 2.4 gigahertz frequency

1653
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,920
will give them more range compared to

1654
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,359
900 megahertz and

1655
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,359
that is a misconception and that is not

1656
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,720
true in fact

1657
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,880
at same power level and at same

1658
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,760
modulation

1659
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,599
lower frequencies will give you more

1660
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,559
range example 900 megahertz will give

1661
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:39,440
you more range

1662
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,319
as compared to 2.4 gigahertz but that is

1663
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,760
one when you are comparing apples to

1664
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,680
apples and not apple 2 orange

1665
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,680
make sure that when you are comparing

1666
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,800
any frequencies

1667
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
they are transmitting on same power

1668
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,319
levels obviously

1669
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,240
obviously if 2.4 gigahertz radio is

1670
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,680
transmitting at higher power level you

1671
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,119
will get more range but

1672
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,359
if they are on same power level they are

1673
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,040
on same they are using same modulation

1674
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,760
technique

1675
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,440
then lower frequencies will give you

1676
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,119
more range also lower frequencies

1677
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,119
wavelength are bigger and therefore they

1678
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,480
have better penetration

1679
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,440
so it's a simple formula c is equal to

1680
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,160
mu lambda

1681
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,960
c is the speed of light constant uh that

1682
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,800
is 3 into 10 raised to the power 8 meter

1683
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,760
per second

1684
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,440
mu is the frequency and lambda is the

1685
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,280
wavelength so by this formula

1686
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,520
frequency is inversely proportional to

1687
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,520
wavelength so more the frequency

1688
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,280
less is the wavelength less the

1689
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,200
frequency more is the wavelength so

1690
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,200
obviously 900 megahertz uh

1691
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,200
signal will have more wavelength a

1692
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,280
bigger wavelength and

1693
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,720
it will give better penetration

1694
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,640
capability so it can penetrate better

1695
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,599
through walls and

1696
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,280
concrete structures and whatnot compared

1697
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,280
to higher wavelengths

1698
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,280
also more data rate is equal to less

1699
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,800
range so uh

1700
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,000
what i mean by that if you're

1701
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,480
transmitting 2 megabytes 2 megabits per

1702
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,440
second you will get

1703
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,559
less range compared to if you're

1704
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,480
transmitting let's say 2 kilobytes per

1705
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,440
second so

1706
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,880
you need to make sure that you are only

1707
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,640
transmitting the

1708
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,640
minimum amount of data and not

1709
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,720
excessively using the channel

1710
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,720
because there are certain concepts which

1711
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,920
are involved and which

1712
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,960
reduces the range these are out of

1713
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,680
scope for this particular class but i'll

1714
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,960
i'll just throw some of

1715
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,359
the some of the dragons that you some

1716
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:18,000
you may

1717
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,359
google out if you want out of your

1718
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,599
interest so there is a channel limit

1719
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:21,920
there

1720
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,720
is a channel bandwidth and then there is

1721
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,040
a

1722
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,079
link budget which hampers this

1723
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,640
data rate and ranges so feel free to

1724
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,839
google this out and

1725
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,680
uh let's bring bring question to

1726
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,440
officers if you want but

1727
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,240
for this particular session you just

1728
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,119
need to know that

1729
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,799
more data rate means less range

1730
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,880
okay so moving ahead one might ask that

1731
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,160
if

1732
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,839
lower frequencies are providing more

1733
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,440
range they have better penetration

1734
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,799
capabilities then why

1735
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,799
are we using high frequencies then the

1736
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,079
answer is simple so

1737
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,920
higher frequencies that is a 2.4

1738
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,240
gigahertz or 5 gigahertz or 5.8

1739
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,319
gigahertz they comes under the ism band

1740
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,240
and they are widely accepted as free to

1741
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:04,720
use

1742
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,880
band around the world so if you want to

1743
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,720
buy one transmitter and take it anywhere

1744
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,680
in into the world

1745
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,920
you don't want 900 megahertz maybe you

1746
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,240
are allowed 900 megahertz in asia but if

1747
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,680
you are moving to us

1748
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,839
you cannot use it because it's used by

1749
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,720
some other cellular communication and

1750
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,400
lower frequencies are generally used by

1751
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,000
cellular communication that is the last

1752
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,640
point

1753
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,440
in india i think there is 800 megahertz

1754
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,720
which is reserved for cellular

1755
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,000
communication that is a mobile

1756
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,960
communication so

1757
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,319
obviously you cannot use that that is

1758
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,160
a link which is uh assigned to that

1759
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,760
particular task and you are you don't

1760
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,240
want to

1761
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,520
uh jump into that and and and and

1762
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,000
jam that signals or or populate that

1763
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,839
particular band

1764
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,680
other reason which you might want to use

1765
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,520
high frequency is more bandwidth

1766
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,280
so higher frequencies gives you a more

1767
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,520
bandwidth there are more channels

1768
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,880
in in the bandwidth in the same

1769
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,640
frequency range so i'll give you a

1770
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,720
simple example if you have ever seen

1771
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,319
the wi-fi router there are wi-fi uh

1772
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,480
channels it says you want to transmit on

1773
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,319
channel 11 channel 7

1774
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,920
so if you don't you just need to log

1775
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,359
into your router and see on what

1776
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,839
what channel it is transmitting it is

1777
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,839
transmitting in 2.4 gigahertz but that

1778
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,000
is not exactly 2.4 gigahertz it can

1779
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,640
be 2.40 gigahertz it can be 2.44

1780
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,359
gigahertz

1781
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,440
or it can also be 2.6 gigahertz so this

1782
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,760
is the entire bandwidth the entire range

1783
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,599
uh on which the frequency is divided so

1784
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,119
more the higher frequencies gives you

1785
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,480
more bandwidth so you have more number

1786
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,440
of channels

1787
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,160
it also helps in uh frequency hopping so

1788
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,760
more number of channels you have

1789
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,319
better you can hop these channels so

1790
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:39,760
that is another reason to use high

1791
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,960
frequencies

1792
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,960
uh another thing is small antenna size

1793
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,640
so lower the frequencies is the bigger

1794
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,720
antenna size it gets and will uh will

1795
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,240
will understand that in

1796
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,119
in in a bit in later slides but for now

1797
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,799
just understand that lower frequencies

1798
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,559
need bigger and bigger for transmission

1799
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,400
higher frequencies need smaller antenna

1800
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,000
for transmission and you do not

1801
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,880
want to go on a field and take a massive

1802
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,480
three feet antenna with you

1803
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,520
for flying a small fpv drone so that is

1804
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,319
why you need

1805
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:09,440
to have high frequencies uh and again

1806
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,720
the last one i already mentioned at

1807
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,160
lower frequencies are generally used for

1808
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,839
cellular communication and you are not

1809
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:17,040
allowed to transmit in that

1810
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,200
another thing which someone may ask is

1811
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,480
uh so this

1812
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,040
uh radio on the left is transmitting at

1813
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,079
10 milliwatt

1814
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,079
so we need more range how about we

1815
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,839
increase the power we make it let's say

1816
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:28,720
one watt

1817
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,119
so we will get more range so that is

1818
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,720
true but you can do that so but

1819
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,079
uh it's not uh uh it's not uh

1820
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,200
as simple as it seems there are legal

1821
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,119
aspects involved there are

1822
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,119
uh authorities which are responsible to

1823
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,640
see that you are under limit and you are

1824
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,200
not

1825
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,079
transmitting at very high power uh

1826
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,160
increasing the power increases the range

1827
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:50,640
but

1828
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,640
uh there is something called inverse

1829
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,319
square law so

1830
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,119
it doesn't means that every signal which

1831
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,319
you are transmitting is

1832
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,559
receiving to your receiver uh some

1833
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,559
signal goes to the open space

1834
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,480
uh and they get lost so if you are

1835
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,000
doubling uh the

1836
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
if you are doubling the power you do not

1837
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,839
double the range and that never happens

1838
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,359
it's called inverse square law and we

1839
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,040
will discuss some more about that in the

1840
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,400
fpv chapter

1841
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,280
which is due to come there is something

1842
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,040
called antenna gains

1843
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,200
antenna also has gain it is not an

1844
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,720
active component antenna don't have

1845
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,480
batteries but they have gains

1846
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,680
something we will also discuss in the

1847
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,920
fpv chapter not now uh

1848
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,960
but for a rule of thumb uh just know

1849
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,280
that

1850
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,640
uh twice the increase in power is equal

1851
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,200
to

1852
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,400
3 dbi of gain of isotropic antenna

1853
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,520
so uh so so to get uh

1854
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,480
so to so to get 3 dbi increase of gain

1855
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,319
you need to increase the power by 2

1856
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:49,440
so that is a small match there again you

1857
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,960
do not need to stress on that we will

1858
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,960
talk about that later in the fpv chapter

1859
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,000
but for now

1860
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,880
uh these are the answer of why uh we

1861
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,839
cannot uh

1862
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,680
why uh we are using high frequencies and

1863
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,440
why we cannot just simply increase the

1864
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,880
power to get more range

1865
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,880
uh last thing i want to talk about in

1866
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,720
this particular site is antenna dead

1867
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,920
zone and that is uh one topic that i

1868
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,040
want to

1869
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,280
take on the ipad uh that is my

1870
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,319
whiteboard

1871
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:18,000
so let me switch to that and

1872
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,799
let me show you what i mean by antenna

1873
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,359
dead zone

1874
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,760
okay so i am on uh my whiteboard and i

1875
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,839
hope i am able to draw

1876
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,880
yes you can see so uh in a schematic an

1877
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,799
antenna is generally

1878
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:36,640
represented like this so this is an

1879
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,000
antenna and

1880
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,040
if you if you look on my overhead camera

1881
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,559
and if you look on this transmitter so

1882
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,640
this is the antenna this is also known

1883
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,400
as a linear antenna or rubber duck

1884
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,200
antenna

1885
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,839
so this kind of antenna it transmits in

1886
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,280
two direction

1887
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,480
and this transmit in this direction

1888
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,319
this is called a lobe and this

1889
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:57,520
transmitted in this direction this is

1890
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,880
called another lobe

1891
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,480
so this is my antenna and this is

1892
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,319
transmitting in this direction and this

1893
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,760
is transmitting in this direction

1894
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,440
and there is no transmission in this

1895
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,440
direction

1896
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,119
and there is no transmission in this

1897
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,599
direction

1898
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,319
so these two direction are also known as

1899
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,359
the dead zone

1900
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:18,400
so you always want to face your antenna

1901
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,240
uh this way if you are flying your drone

1902
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,640
over over here or if you are flying a

1903
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,760
drone over here

1904
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,920
but as soon as your antenna of your

1905
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,920
drone comes in this particular direction

1906
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,599
or this particular direction

1907
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,200
it will receive no signal and it will

1908
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,359
do uh something called fail safe which

1909
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,280
we will also be discussing in another

1910
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,240
slide

1911
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,720
but just for now understand that every

1912
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,079
antenna has dead zone

1913
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,119
and every antenna is having a particular

1914
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:45,599
shape

1915
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,440
uh the antenna which we are using on our

1916
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,799
transmitter it's called

1917
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,040
uh linear antenna and the property of

1918
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,640
linear antenna is

1919
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,839
uh it only transmits in this particular

1920
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:57,599
lobes so there is no transmission

1921
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,680
in this direction and it's like a cone

1922
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,119
so the far you go

1923
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,079
the far uh the cone gets bigger the far

1924
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,400
the transmission is but as soon as

1925
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,640
the receiver comes in these particular

1926
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,000
directions then it may

1927
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,480
lost the signal so make sure to always

1928
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,760
keep your antenna

1929
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,760
facing these this way and your drone in

1930
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,760
this way

1931
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,400
uh so this particular property can be

1932
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
changed by changing the type of antenna

1933
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,240
and there are more antennas like

1934
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,160
circular polarized antennas or direction

1935
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,000
antenna so moving on let's talk about

1936
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,599
the number of channels so every

1937
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,359
transmitter has some channels every

1938
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,799
receiver has some channels so this

1939
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,079
transmitter which i have

1940
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,960
has 16 channels and let me move to the

1941
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,480
overhead camera to

1942
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,079
show you what are different channels so

1943
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:45,680
so uh this uh so this one has

1944
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,920
one channel for throttle one channel for

1945
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,280
roll one channel for pitch one

1946
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,920
channel for your so these are four

1947
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,720
channels

1948
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,720
apart from that every switch is one

1949
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,839
channel so

1950
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,160
these switch are also like channels

1951
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,280
these joysticks

1952
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,760
are also like channels these ports on

1953
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,359
the sides on the back

1954
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,319
so all these are channels which means

1955
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:11,119
every

1956
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,240
particular channel is sending one uh

1957
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,400
one value of data so this is sending one

1958
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,000
value of data data pitch

1959
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,760
this is sending even value data that is

1960
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,920
a role and you can program this to send

1961
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:22,480
different

1962
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,319
values for example i have programmed

1963
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,720
this one uh to change the mode of my

1964
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,440
drone

1965
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,280
and we will discuss more of the drones

1966
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,640
in software uh

1967
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,000
class where we'll talk about what are

1968
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,319
different modes you can fly on drone so

1969
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,799
from for going to mode 1 to mode 2 to

1970
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,559
mode 3 i have used this channel

1971
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,240
so this is also sending data to my

1972
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,000
receiver and the data will be passed to

1973
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,359
the flight controller to do

1974
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,119
some calculation and on the base of that

1975
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,039
calculation the mode of the antenna will

1976
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,839
change

1977
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:49,920
also these joysticks can send some data

1978
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,119
for example uh

1979
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,079
this can send if i want to ascend my

1980
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,079
drone or i want to descend my drone

1981
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,079
in in particular intervals and whatnot

1982
01:02:58,079 --> 01:02:59,760
so uh

1983
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,599
generally speaking for a drone or for

1984
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,680
any rc hobby for planes or something you

1985
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,280
need at least six channels so

1986
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,480
roll pitch your throttle r4 channels and

1987
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,400
two channels more are good to have

1988
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,720
so information is transmitted over the

1989
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,720
channels so every channel contain

1990
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,839
particular type of information

1991
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,160
for example throttle your pitch and roll

1992
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,359
these are information which

1993
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:26,480
is transmitted there are auxiliary

1994
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,760
channels which we talked about so these

1995
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,280
are auxiliary channels which

1996
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,760
you can use to program what value you

1997
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,280
want to send

1998
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,799
these channels are multiplex and what i

1999
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,720
mean by that is so you have one

2000
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,640
frequency and all the information from

2001
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,160
this channel is going to that one

2002
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,280
particular

2003
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,520
frequency one particular radio frequency

2004
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,280
channel so you need to do some kind of

2005
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,480
multiplexing so

2006
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,760
generally it's time division

2007
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,599
multiplexing that is all the channels

2008
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,680
are separated by a small time interval

2009
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,680
so it is easier for receiver to

2010
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,880
interpret uh

2011
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,319
what is the value of throttle what is

2012
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,200
the value of your and so on

2013
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,119
so receiver and transmitter can have

2014
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:02,720
different number of channels for example

2015
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,119
this

2016
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,960
transmitter has 16 channels but this

2017
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,799
receiver only has six channels so

2018
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:08,559
you can send maximum six channels only

2019
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,880
to this receiver if you try to send more

2020
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,400
than six channels it will

2021
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,119
discard the channels which are coming

2022
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:16,880
after the sixth channel so that's how it

2023
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,079
works

2024
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,160
number of channels at rx site matters so

2025
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,760
obviously because this is

2026
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,880
the receiver which is going to be

2027
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,200
mounted on the drone so this receiver is

2028
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,640
sending data to your flight controller

2029
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,119
so

2030
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:28,720
the channels on your receiver that is

2031
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,559
the only thing that matters you can have

2032
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:32,240
16 channels here but you can only use

2033
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,839
six channels because your receiver has a

2034
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:36,400
limitation

2035
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,960
uh now let's talk about transmitter and

2036
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,799
receiver protocols and to understand

2037
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:41,200
that

2038
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,359
see this one diagram so this is your

2039
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:44,559
radio transmitter

2040
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,000
this is your receiver and this is your

2041
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
flight controller so your receiver talks

2042
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,520
to your flight controller

2043
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,799
and your transmitter talks to your

2044
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,440
receiver so on the transmitter side

2045
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,760
you have a transmitter protocol that

2046
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,760
means the protocol on which the receiver

2047
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,119
and transmitter talks

2048
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:01,200
and on the flight controller side you

2049
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,799
have the receiver protocol that means

2050
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,160
how your receiver talks to your flight

2051
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,119
controller

2052
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,960
so talking about the tx protocol that

2053
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,960
defines the channel multiplexing that

2054
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,880
defines modulation that defines uh

2055
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,799
defines frequency hopping and error

2056
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:13,760
check

2057
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,880
so basically in a nutshell what happens

2058
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,440
is

2059
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,760
your transmitter and your receiver both

2060
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,400
uses a radio frequency chip a 2.4

2061
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,119
gigahertz

2062
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,839
chipset and uh on the on the top of that

2063
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,839
chipset they make their own protocol

2064
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:28,319
that

2065
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,160
how we are sending each channel we are

2066
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,079
sending throttle first or we are sending

2067
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:33,280
your first

2068
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,640
and uh how frequently we are sending

2069
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,559
what is uh what is the modulation we are

2070
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,240
using what is the frequency hopping

2071
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,680
algorithm we are using

2072
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,440
and what is the error check we are doing

2073
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,760
so this is mostly a digital signal

2074
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,319
uh coming from transmitter to receiver

2075
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,000
and this is a proprietary so these are

2076
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,319
not

2077
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:51,760
open source these are not protocols

2078
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,680
defined by the community the

2079
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,039
transmitter and the receiver

2080
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,440
manufacturer they decide that protocol

2081
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,280
so generally speaking you can find the

2082
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,079
protocol such as d8 and d16 for

2083
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,200
fr sky transmitters and

2084
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,039
you can find protocols like fast if

2085
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:08,640
you're using a futaba transmitter so

2086
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,359
these are

2087
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,640
transmitter companies which make

2088
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,119
transmitters if you're using a spectrum

2089
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,480
transmitter then the protocol they are

2090
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,760
using is called dsm-2 or dsm-x

2091
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,880
so your receiver and your transmitter

2092
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,640
both should understand same protocol so

2093
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,599
that is

2094
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,680
why the compatibility comes into the

2095
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,079
picture you cannot use any receiver with

2096
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:29,119
any transmitter

2097
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,720
they both need to understand each other

2098
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,240
language they both need to understand

2099
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,599
each of the protocols

2100
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,160
that is where tx protocols are important

2101
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,200
and

2102
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,359
again these are propriety protocols the

2103
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,559
manufacturer design them as they want

2104
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,039
however on the rx side the receiver

2105
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:46,319
communicates to the flight controller

2106
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:47,680
and this communication link

2107
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,359
we will see in more details in the

2108
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:50,799
flight controller chapter

2109
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:53,039
but for uh but for now you can you can

2110
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,079
understand that

2111
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,160
uh these protocol can be generic they

2112
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,920
cannot be they cannot they cannot be

2113
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,240
proprietary so generally speaking like

2114
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,839
it can be generic like pulse with

2115
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,839
modulation

2116
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,640
pulse position modulation pulse coded

2117
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,440
modulation

2118
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,119
so these are kind of modulation

2119
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,359
techniques used in signal process

2120
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:12,880
using signal and digital signal

2121
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,799
transmissions and whatnot

2122
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,319
uh we will talk about that in fact

2123
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,000
control chapter so don't worry

2124
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,799
uh if if if the term scares you for now

2125
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:23,039
uh it can also be proprietary like s bus

2126
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,920
was developed by futaba and crsf is

2127
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,520
developed by team black sheep so these

2128
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,359
are drone manufacturers

2129
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,640
uh it can also talk on an analog signal

2130
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,880
like pwm and ppm are analog in nature

2131
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,079
they are not digital signals they are

2132
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:37,680
not zeros and one they are actually

2133
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,440
analog waves which are sent out and

2134
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,440
interpreted by the flight controller

2135
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,599
they but it can also be digital like s

2136
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,359
bus and i bus these are the protocols

2137
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:46,240
which are

2138
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,880
based on zeros and ones so digital is of

2139
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,160
course

2140
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,760
a better more reliable signal

2141
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,119
also receiver can send data to a data to

2142
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,480
fat controller

2143
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,319
in a parallel fashion like for example

2144
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,160
if this receiver has four channels

2145
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,039
throttle pitch

2146
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,520
yaw and roll so each channel can have

2147
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,880
one wire of itself

2148
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,440
throttle can have one wire going to the

2149
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,880
flight controller from receiver

2150
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,280
your can have another wire so each wire

2151
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,960
carries one channel

2152
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,880
uh that is called parallel communication

2153
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,560
so example of parallel communication is

2154
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,238
pwm protocol

2155
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:22,238
but this receiver can also send all the

2156
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:23,920
data in single wire like i have seen

2157
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:24,719
here so

2158
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,799
red is red and black are the power for

2159
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:28,719
receiver and yellow is a single wire on

2160
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:29,279
which

2161
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,158
all the data of throttle your pitch roll

2162
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,238
and auxiliary channels are transmitted

2163
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:36,479
so example of serial protocols are s bus

2164
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,238
where only one wire is used

2165
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:41,120
for every for all the all the channels

2166
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,719
while on the parallel each channel will

2167
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:43,120
get

2168
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,560
one wire of its own uh

2169
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,040
so a few takeaways so one transmitter

2170
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,120
can offer multiple protocols for example

2171
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,479
there could be one transmitter in the

2172
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,960
market which can do d8 d16 and also do

2173
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,319
dsm ii

2174
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,479
uh tx and rx protocol are entered are

2175
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,158
not interdependent that means tx

2176
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:01,759
protocol can be different rx protocol

2177
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:02,799
can be different

2178
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:06,158
uh you may have rx that speaks uh

2179
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:09,600
d8 and that speaks pwm and also s bus

2180
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,158
but they are not uh mutually dependent

2181
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:12,640
and

2182
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,520
they don't defines if you are restricted

2183
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,359
by particularly one kind of protocols

2184
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,279
that is not the case

2185
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:21,759
uh end of the day it's all about latency

2186
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,359
so all these protocols so

2187
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,120
the question is why do we need all kind

2188
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,920
of protocols why do we need d8 d16 here

2189
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,880
why do we need pw and s bus here so it's

2190
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,479
all about latency so as

2191
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:35,279
as the demand for fast and flashed

2192
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,359
drones fast and fast signal processing

2193
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,600
comes into picture as more research are

2194
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,679
happening in these areas the latency is

2195
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:42,560
going down

2196
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,880
and these new protocols they are they

2197
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,759
provide

2198
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,359
more real-time communication and less

2199
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,279
latency okay so in the

2200
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,920
uh last slide i told you that uh the

2201
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,960
transmitter which

2202
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,960
we are having out of the box they can

2203
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,960
transmit at 2.4 gigahertz and 10

2204
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:57,760
milliwatt

2205
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,159
but that doesn't mean you need to

2206
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,679
restrict on that frequencies on that

2207
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:02,000
power

2208
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,480
level uh some good transmitters like the

2209
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,920
one i'm having here they have

2210
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,120
something called jrb which is exactly

2211
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,800
like an extension port

2212
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,880
where you can put external modules and

2213
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,640
increases its capability

2214
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,640
so for example you can add something

2215
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,719
called lrs which is known as long range

2216
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:19,440
system or

2217
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,000
a uhf called ultra high frequencies so

2218
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,520
this is the kind of module i'm talking

2219
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,199
about you can see on the photo this one

2220
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:26,000
is

2221
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,080
easy uhf by a company called immersion

2222
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,239
rc it's an ultra high frequency

2223
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,320
module and this is a team flagship

2224
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,520
crossfire

2225
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,760
an lrs module or long range system

2226
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,040
module as it called

2227
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,440
so on the back of the transmitter i'll

2228
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,280
show you on my transmitter so on the

2229
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:41,760
back

2230
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,520
you you have a port which

2231
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,360
you can open up and you can see there

2232
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,280
are some pins on which

2233
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,840
uh the external modules can be connected

2234
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,960
and this uh

2235
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,880
this increases the range and it

2236
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,840
increases the capability

2237
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,400
so what you are doing here is

2238
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,280
basically uh you are increasing the

2239
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,120
capability of a transmitter you

2240
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,440
are changing the frequency because this

2241
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,440
module runs on different frequency

2242
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,199
if i remember correctly it works on 900

2243
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,199
megahertz and it can change power level

2244
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:14,560
up to 1 watt

2245
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,800
so you can increase the power level if

2246
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,880
you if you already have permissions to

2247
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,520
do that

2248
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,080
and if you have programmed the model

2249
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,040
correctly

2250
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,640
there are some programming might be

2251
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,840
required some configuration might be

2252
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,800
required but

2253
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,480
uh basically you can change the

2254
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,400
frequency you can change the protocol so

2255
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,280
by default

2256
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,520
this transmitter works on d8 protocol as

2257
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,520
i uh told you in the last in the next

2258
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,080
slide

2259
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,640
but this uh module has its protocol on

2260
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,560
its own it's called csrf

2261
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,120
so you can do that so not every

2262
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,480
transmitter has that so

2263
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,400
only the good a bit expensive

2264
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,600
transmitter provide you these

2265
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,040
capabilities but again

2266
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,040
it's very flexible and one of the good

2267
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,560
thing which you can do is you can also

2268
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,000
make some diy modules

2269
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,679
like on the left you can see a picture

2270
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,560
of nrf24 model which is a very common

2271
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,040
module rf used with arduino and you can

2272
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,080
control your own

2273
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,520
uh homemade drones home homemade

2274
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,600
transmitters or a small drone if you

2275
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,040
have made using these kinds of radio so

2276
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,080
uh overall uh these

2277
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,560
transmitters run some open source

2278
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,199
firmware

2279
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,960
so if i talk about my transmitter it

2280
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,640
runs on open source formula called open

2281
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,520
tx

2282
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,760
and you can change the code you can you

2283
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,280
can you can program your own external

2284
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,800
modules you can take uh

2285
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,199
the advantage of this jr bay where you

2286
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,640
can plug external modules

2287
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,320
so basically what you are doing is you

2288
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,760
are disabling the internal

2289
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,840
uh radio chip and you are enabling the

2290
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,040
external radio chip which you have

2291
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:37,760
plugged

2292
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,159
and basic uh you and based on that you

2293
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:40,880
can

2294
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,040
you can attach these modules to

2295
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,120
different receiver different uh

2296
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,719
antennas and you can get different

2297
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:48,560
frequencies and protocol so that is

2298
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,440
entire idea

2299
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,679
of making it modular and extended

2300
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,199
extending its capabilities

2301
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:58,000
uh so this is a transmitter and it talks

2302
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,440
to a receiver

2303
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,760
but this receiver can also talk back to

2304
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,760
transmitter and this concept is known as

2305
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,800
telemetry

2306
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,960
a very powerful concept and let's

2307
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,719
understand why you want your receiver to

2308
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:10,080
talk back to your transmitter so

2309
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,199
receiver is mounting

2310
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,199
mounted on your drone transmitter is in

2311
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,800
your hand so why do you want your

2312
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,000
receiver to talk to the

2313
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,520
talk to your transmitter so it's it's

2314
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,520
very simple you want your

2315
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,040
you want to have the knowledge of your

2316
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,360
drone current gps coordinates you want

2317
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,880
to know the current battery status you

2318
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,400
want to know the current speed

2319
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,880
so this can be done with the receiver

2320
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,640
but the question is so this is a small

2321
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,520
receiver this

2322
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,520
does not have a gps inbuilt this does

2323
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,800
not have a

2324
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,040
a voltage sensor or a speed sensor then

2325
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,640
how this receiver is uh

2326
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,719
passing this data to a transmitter back

2327
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:42,400
the answer is very simple this receiver

2328
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,159
is talking to the flight controller the

2329
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,000
flight controller knows all these

2330
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,600
the flight controller can send this data

2331
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,360
to receiver and receiver can send back

2332
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,400
to the

2333
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,800
transmitter so basically this is not a

2334
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,640
receiver this is a trans receiver it can

2335
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,880
also transmit so that is a powerful

2336
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,520
concept and this is known as telemetry

2337
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,239
we will see in the greater details and

2338
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:02,640
if i

2339
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,239
if i go to the overhead camera

2340
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:09,679
welcome to open tx you might heard that

2341
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,280
my transmitter speaks to me so when i'm

2342
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,640
flying with the goggles on

2343
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,719
and i want to know my battery status i

2344
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:17,840
can flick a switch like this

2345
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,080
so for that i need to program it so i

2346
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,600
can flick a switch like this and it will

2347
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,520
speak the current battery to me i can

2348
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,440
flick a switch like this and it can tell

2349
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,520
me the current flight time so

2350
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,520
this is the powerful concept called

2351
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,360
telemetry that is sending data back to

2352
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,800
the ground station and

2353
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,679
uh receivers like this uh can do that so

2354
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,199
you'll see two antennas

2355
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,199
uh that is not for redundancy one

2356
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,960
antenna is to receive and another

2357
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,320
antenna has to transfer back to the

2358
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,960
ground station

2359
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,159
okay so let's

2360
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:53,920
move ahead and talk about the antenna

2361
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,360
so basically on the receiver side the

2362
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,280
length of antenna or the shape of

2363
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,679
antenna that doesn't really matter

2364
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,880
uh it does matter but not at that extent

2365
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,199
at

2366
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:07,199
as it mattered to a transmitter because

2367
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:08,880
a transmitter is a

2368
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,000
sending signal out at a power and if the

2369
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:12,880
receiver is

2370
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,719
not good there is uh sorry the antenna

2371
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,960
is not good the antenna is catchy or

2372
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,080
the antenna is not designed properly the

2373
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,199
there is no

2374
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:22,800
impedance matching there is a concept

2375
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,560
called impedance matching that is used

2376
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,400
everywhere in electronics so if antenna

2377
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,239
is not particularly matched for that

2378
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:29,120
frequency

2379
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,040
and because the transmitter is sending

2380
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,040
signal out in some power

2381
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,719
it can burn the transmitter because

2382
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,560
there is no way the signal is going out

2383
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,000
the transmitter wants the signal

2384
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,719
to go out via an antenna but the antenna

2385
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:41,520
is crappy

2386
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,280
it will burn the transmitter so the

2387
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,560
design of antenna is

2388
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,920
very crucial there uh so uh you

2389
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,600
you might be you might be thinking that

2390
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,120
diane you told us that

2391
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,880
on higher frequencies the antenna length

2392
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,480
is very small that is why we use higher

2393
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,360
frequencies

2394
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,360
we are using 2.4 gigahertz which is very

2395
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,960
high frequencies then why we are having

2396
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,760
such a

2397
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,960
big antenna and if i if i take you to

2398
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,080
an overhead camera you can see the

2399
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,679
length of antenna is quite big so this

2400
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:08,880
is my receiver

2401
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,520
and this is the antenna it's it's it's

2402
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,880
quite big

2403
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,719
as you can see here so this is my

2404
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,880
receiver and this is the overall length

2405
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,239
of the antenna which is quite

2406
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:19,679
significant big

2407
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:21,440
so you might be thinking that why is

2408
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,640
that even though we're using high

2409
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,360
frequencies

2410
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,239
so i'll say that this is not a big

2411
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,199
antenna

2412
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,520
you just need this small length the

2413
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,600
exposed length it is also known as the

2414
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,199
active element of this antenna so this

2415
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:34,719
is very small you can see

2416
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,840
so only this uh exposed length matter

2417
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,679
and this length which is covered does

2418
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:40,880
not matter uh

2419
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,440
this is just there to provide you with

2420
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,600
some extra length so in case

2421
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,600
you crash your drone the antenna breaks

2422
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,280
you can peel off

2423
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,719
this length back and you get back the

2424
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:52,640
active element so this is

2425
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,560
nothing but a co axial wire which is

2426
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,640
having uh uh

2427
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,199
having a wire inside it a coaxial wire

2428
01:16:59,199 --> 01:16:59,840
inside it

2429
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,440
and only this exposed length matter so

2430
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,960
you can see how small is that

2431
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,719
only that length is better for the

2432
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,239
transmission and this is just

2433
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:08,239
to have some extra length in case you

2434
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,080
you break this you can peel off back and

2435
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:10,480
you can

2436
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,600
get your get the good range back so

2437
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,199
range is very sensitive to length of the

2438
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,000
antenna and

2439
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,080
if you cut a small piece here let's say

2440
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,280
even one millimeter

2441
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,040
you will get very bad range you will

2442
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,360
start having signal losses so

2443
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,480
uh make sure to have a proper range

2444
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,280
uh so again the same point when i say

2445
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,159
that uh

2446
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:32,239
my transmitter and receiver works on 2.4

2447
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,120
gigahertz i mean the 2.4 gigahertz band

2448
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,719
and this is an entire frequency band

2449
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,800
which may range from 2.4 to 2.8

2450
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,480
gigahertz and so on

2451
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,719
so uh how do we calculate this length of

2452
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,080
this exposed antenna

2453
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,760
how do i know what should be the length

2454
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,679
of my exposed antenna so it's a simple

2455
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:48,800
formula

2456
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,760
so the wavelength can be calculated by

2457
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,000
uh dividing frequency in gigahertz by

2458
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,080
300 so

2459
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,000
the band is 2.4 gigahertz which range

2460
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,159
from 2.40 to 2.8

2461
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:02,320
so let's take 2.44 gigahertz as the

2462
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,080
middle band so if we divide

2463
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:08,400
300 by 2.44 we will get 122.95

2464
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,280
millimeter of wavelength and the length

2465
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,600
of antenna is wavelength divided by 4

2466
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,640
so 122.95 divided by 4 is equal to 31

2467
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,600
millimeter

2468
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,880
so 31 millimeter or 3.1 centi centimeter

2469
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,080
is the only antenna

2470
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,000
of active element you need on your

2471
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,840
receiver so that's how small it is

2472
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,199
receiver connection with the flight

2473
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:28,880
controller we will discuss that in

2474
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,840
flight controller but

2475
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,199
i've already mentioned that there are

2476
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:32,719
two kind of connection you can do

2477
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:34,239
between the receiver and the flight

2478
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,199
controller

2479
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:37,600
one is the parallel where each channel

2480
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:38,800
have its own

2481
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,880
uh connection throttle has its own

2482
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,400
connection roll has its own

2483
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,280
uh on wire which has its own wire and so

2484
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,159
on

2485
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:48,080
in the serial there is only one wire and

2486
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,679
all the data of all channels is

2487
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:54,000
transmitted to that particular wire

2488
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,920
there is one thing that i need to

2489
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,840
mention that is called failsafe that i

2490
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,360
already showed you on the whiteboard

2491
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,600
that there that this antenna transmits

2492
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,120
in two lobes on the left and the side

2493
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,880
because it's designed that way

2494
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,040
so on the center there is a dead zone

2495
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,560
and

2496
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,000
that is where the fails have happened so

2497
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,760
what is the fail safe so

2498
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,080
uh this transmitter and receiver had a

2499
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,600
particular range let's say it has one

2500
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,360
kilometer range and if you exceed that

2501
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,960
range if you take a drone below

2502
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,199
uh beyond one kilometer you will lose

2503
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:22,880
the signal or you will lose the signal

2504
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,480
if you come into the dead zone

2505
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,040
so one thing in the drone which will

2506
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:27,600
trigger

2507
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,520
uh when you lose the signal to your

2508
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,960
transmitter it's called fail safe so

2509
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,480
what is a space if

2510
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,400
failsafe is a situation which happens

2511
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,480
when uh the transmitter and receiver can

2512
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,920
no longer communicate

2513
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,520
maybe they are out of range maybe there

2514
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,280
is some interference whatever

2515
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,280
they are not able to communicate and a

2516
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,440
situation of failsafe happen

2517
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,560
as a drone builder as a drone pilot you

2518
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,120
have

2519
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,880
the liberty to choose what you want to

2520
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,640
do when the situation happen

2521
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,880
so one thing which you want to do is cut

2522
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,800
off the motor and let the drone fall

2523
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,120
as a rock one thing you can do is let

2524
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,159
the drone fly

2525
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:03,280
as the same altitude is flying

2526
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,719
one thing you can do is let the drone

2527
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,639
ascend very slowly

2528
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:08,719
so depending on that you can program in

2529
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:10,000
your flight controller what you want to

2530
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,360
do when the situation of fails have

2531
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,000
happen

2532
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,400
uh the last thing i want to show we need

2533
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,480
to go to the overhead camera

2534
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,400
so i have i have done a small setup here

2535
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,159
so this is my transmitter

2536
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,120
and i have one receiver here uh which is

2537
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,480
connected to two motors

2538
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,480
uh one servo motor and one brushless dc

2539
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,159
motor

2540
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:32,400
so how do my transmitter know

2541
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,840
so how do my transmitter know that it

2542
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,679
needs to talk to this receiver so we

2543
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:37,440
need to do something called binding of

2544
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,080
receiver

2545
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,320
so i need to bind my receiver to my

2546
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,000
transmitter and every receiver has

2547
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
different process to bind it

2548
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,920
in this particular one i don't remember

2549
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,000
but there is one button or you need to

2550
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:48,880
short some

2551
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,199
some pins and connect to the battery for

2552
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:53,040
example in this receiver there is one

2553
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:53,840
button here

2554
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,360
you need to you need to put your

2555
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,199
transmitter in binding mode you need to

2556
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:58,719
press the button and you need to power

2557
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,639
it on and it will bind together

2558
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:02,400
uh so you need to consult the

2559
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,840
documentation of your particular

2560
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,120
transmitter and your receiver

2561
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,440
and you can able to bind that but over

2562
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,280
here i am already

2563
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:13,040
bounded these two so this receiver is

2564
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,400
this receiver is bounded to my

2565
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,800
transmitter and i want to show how it

2566
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,040
rotates this motor so i need to give

2567
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,320
power to this

2568
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,639
okay so i have bounded this receiver to

2569
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:24,000
my transmitter already

2570
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,679
uh this is the receiver and this is

2571
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:27,040
bounded to my transmitter already you

2572
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,639
can see the green light

2573
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,040
and i have connected the servo motor to

2574
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,080
the roll uh

2575
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,840
access so if i happen if i do roll

2576
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:39,120
you can see the servo is moving

2577
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,719
on the roll axis there will be no

2578
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:42,320
another movement on any other axis

2579
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:42,800
because

2580
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,960
it is on the role access so i have

2581
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,880
connected my role access to the servo

2582
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,800
and i have connected throttle to this

2583
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,199
motor

2584
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,520
you can see as i give throttle the motor

2585
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:00,000
signal

2586
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,239
now i want to show you the situation

2587
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:06,000
where what i will do i will

2588
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,440
power up the motor and i will switch off

2589
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,960
the transmitter and see what will happen

2590
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,000
so i'll power up the motor

2591
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,159
and i switch and i switch off my

2592
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:16,719
transmitter

2593
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,920
and you see as soon as the transmission

2594
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,760
signal is lost the trans the motor

2595
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,320
stopped

2596
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,280
that was all for today's class i hope

2597
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,239
you

2598
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:27,760
get to know a lot of different things

2599
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,520
about frequency

2600
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,080
and transmitters and frame selection and

2601
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,760
there are some myths

2602
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,679
you would be having before that that is

2603
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:37,280
now solved so

2604
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,639
thank you very much for joining and i

2605
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:39,920
look forward to seeing you all in the

2606
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,440
office hours

2607
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,960
thank you very much and see you in the

2608
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:49,920
next class
