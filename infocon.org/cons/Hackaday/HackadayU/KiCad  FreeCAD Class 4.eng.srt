00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,879
hey everyone this is anul mahidarya and

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,400
welcome to this fourth session of

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,560
introduction to kaiken and srikan

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:17,919
at hackaday u

5
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,760
all right so let's begin by launching

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,400
freecad

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,960
i'll be using version 0.18 although i've

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,519
been using version 0.19 for a long time

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:27,840
now

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,320
it's been fairly stable when freecad

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,679
starts up you're presented with the

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,719
start page

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,280
start page gives links to several demo

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,480
projects that you can

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,440
walk through there's also a helpful help

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,079
section

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,079
with links to the various workbenches

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,239
and documentation and so on but

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,719
after a while of having used kai ked you

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,680
can disable this

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,840
under preferences let's close that and

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,800
start a new

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,960
document by file new or clicking on the

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,879
icon and these are the three main

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,840
sections of

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,399
freecad the main canvas at the top is

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,760
the toolbar and the menus

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
and on the left is what's known as the

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,680
combo view within the canvas view we

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,720
have the navigation

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,360
cube which can be enabled or disabled by

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,400
our preferences

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,680
and at the bottom right is the xyz

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,720
access crosses depending on how you like

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,560
to set things up you can choose between

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,200
different

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
navigation inputs so my default is

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,600
gesture but you can also use touchpad or

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,280
cad for example

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,320
freecad can open multiple files so they

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,159
get tabbed here at the bottom

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,439
and the first thing we ought to do is

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
go to edit preferences and set up a

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
couple of things over here

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,960
important one is under general units

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,360
make sure you decide and select the one

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
that you need to use by default it's

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,479
standard millimeter

49
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,040
but since for this project in kai-cad we

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,000
have

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
used the imperial measurements i'm going

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,840
to continue using imperial decimal for

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
this particular

54
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,119
project the other thing you might like

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,240
to do is

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,640
set a short enough auto recovery

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,439
information

58
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,560
the default is 15 minutes i set it to 5

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,200
so we can just click on ok

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
the other thing you have to do is make

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,038
sure you have the required

62
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,280
add-ons and that is accessed by tools

63
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,560
add-on manager

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,599
which then shows you all of the

65
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,720
add-ons that are available as of now for

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,520
us we need

67
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,160
the kaicad step up tools so that's the

68
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,599
one that you have to install

69
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,560
so we can close that you can also go to

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,840
tools customize

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,239
and hide the workbenches that you will

72
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,519
not be using

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,239
panels you can enable or disable certain

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,599
panels if there is an

75
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,200
error in your document usually the

76
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,440
report view will pop up even if it is

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,760
unchecked over here but other than that

78
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,239
just having the combo view is useful

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,720
all right so with that let's give a

80
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
quick rundown of how

81
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,120
you can get started with using the basic

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,680
cad

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
commands in freecad it's kind of

84
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,599
difficult to give you a deep rundown on

85
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,040
this so i'll just skim through the

86
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
surface and give you

87
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
a quick glance of what we can achieve

88
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,000
using the

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,239
common workbenches the easiest way to

90
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,319
get fair understanding is to go to the

91
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,519
part workbench

92
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,080
which brings up a list of primitives

93
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,040
that you can

94
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,599
get for example here's the cube then you

95
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,840
can have a cylinder

96
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,000
sphere a solid cone and so on

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
and then you can perform certain actions

98
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
on

99
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,799
items that you select things like

100
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,519
revolving or mirroring adding a

101
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,680
fillet or a chamfer or you can also

102
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,319
carry out boolean operations like

103
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,480
making a union or making a cart and so

104
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,159
on this whole

105
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,640
toolbar here the viewport toolbar and

106
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,680
lets you choose

107
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,200
different views of your object and

108
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,360
there are some zoom buttons and a

109
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,120
different display options

110
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,519
let's start off by saying how we can use

111
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,640
that let me

112
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,120
add a cube once you do that you get a

113
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,080
front view

114
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
of the cube like so and using gesture

115
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,239
mouse control

116
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,319
in shrika the way it works is scroll

117
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,959
allows you to zoom out or zoom in

118
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
clicking and pressing the primary button

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,959
allows you to rotate

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,920
an object and clicking the secondary

121
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,640
button and

122
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,280
holding it down allows you to move an

123
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,640
object

124
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,040
if you want to get back to the isometric

125
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,918
view this

126
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,000
icon lets you do that if you want to fit

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,199
all to the screen

128
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,280
this icon does that now this is what is

129
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,360
known as the flat lines view which

130
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,479
is this option over here but if you

131
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:30,960
choose

132
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,440
shaded you get something that looks like

133
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,160
this

134
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,720
if you choose a wireframe you get a nice

135
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,160
wireframe so that lets you

136
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,600
choose hidden lines like so so

137
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,120
usually between flat lines and wireframe

138
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,840
is what you'll be switching so that's b2

139
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,479
and

140
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,919
v4 so with that let's see how we can

141
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,479
manipulate this object it's appeared

142
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,320
here in the model tree as cube

143
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,880
and once you click on that you get its

144
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,039
properties over here that includes the

145
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,120
dimensions length width and height but

146
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,039
if you expand the placement tab you'll

147
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:05,360
get

148
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
the position and the axis along which it

149
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,479
is placed and the angle

150
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,400
so you can change these parameters for

151
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,639
example 45 degrees here will

152
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,160
move it along the z-axis put it back to

153
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
zero like so

154
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,919
this moves it in the x-direction this

155
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,720
moves it

156
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,759
in the y direction and so on

157
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,400
this will be the z direction and you can

158
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
also give negative

159
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,280
values over here and finally the length

160
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,560
width and height of the

161
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,199
box if you're trying to do something for

162
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,080
the

163
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,440
kai-ket pcb that we made last time

164
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,880
let's try and make a box the the bottom

165
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,840
part of the box

166
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,400
that might go below the pcb and that

167
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,199
covers

168
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,400
this part of the circuit board and this

169
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,960
much

170
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,479
stays exposed so we'll probably be

171
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,560
needing to build a box whose insides are

172
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,919
2.175 inches wide by

173
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,639
1.6 inches tall and then we'll have to

174
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,400
give some wall thickness to it so maybe

175
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,000
0.1 inches on all sides

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,080
gets me an outside size of 2.375

177
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,720
by 1.8 so let's make sure our box is

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,560
that size five 2.375

179
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,919
1.8 inches wide and

180
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,960
we don't need it to be so tall so maybe

181
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,759
0.25 inches

182
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,680
tall and then zoom all and here's what

183
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,120
it looks like so that's your

184
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,759
initial slab on which you're going to do

185
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,039
certain operations to

186
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,479
make it look like an enclosure now

187
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,479
it's not really easy using just the

188
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,000
primitives to

189
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
start drawing your objects if i needed

190
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,080
to hollow this out i would have to add

191
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,039
a second perimeter change its dimensions

192
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,560
so that it matches

193
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,479
whatever hollow cutout i need to do from

194
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,680
here and

195
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,880
then make a cut boolean between

196
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,840
these two objects let me just place a

197
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,720
cube like so

198
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,759
and move it

199
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,440
by one inch in each direction like so

200
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,840
and i have these two cubes now and i can

201
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,440
do a couple of operations where i can

202
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
take the first

203
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,840
and the second and make a union

204
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,960
which makes it one object like so i

205
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,120
undo that i can choose the first and

206
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,319
then choose the second

207
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,880
and i can make a cut of the two that

208
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,000
makes a square opening

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
over here and do that

210
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,440
and the order in which you choose these

211
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,120
elements makes a difference so

212
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,199
instead of choosing the bigger cube

213
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,240
first if we choose the smaller one first

214
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
and then the bigger one and created a

215
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
cut then we get

216
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,560
a difference between those two objects

217
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,280
so

218
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,240
instead of the cube we can put a

219
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,840
cylinder like so

220
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
and if i right click on the cylinder and

221
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,879
click transform

222
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,000
i can set increment of 0.1 inch and

223
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,800
rotation of 15 degrees and now i can

224
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,520
move

225
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,000
this object by dragging these arrows

226
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,440
in each of the three directions like so

227
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,280
or i can even rotate it along the axis

228
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,759
like so so green moves it along the

229
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,960
y axis but it moves it along the x-axis

230
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,520
and blue moves it around the z-axis

231
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,599
let's say we place it there and then we

232
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,440
make a difference between the two

233
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,159
and that'll give me a circular hole so

234
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,320
let me undo that but

235
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
you'll notice it really becomes a bit

236
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,519
unwieldy to use this

237
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,920
procedure to really do anything useful

238
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,040
and meaningful so

239
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,440
these primitives are useful only in a

240
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
very few

241
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,760
special locations so follow this now

242
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,200
let's just

243
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
delete them the other slightly better

244
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,640
way of doing things

245
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,680
is to use the sketcher workbench

246
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,480
this one that lets you draw a switch and

247
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,040
then

248
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
make certain operations on that sketch

249
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,320
to turn it into a three-dimensional

250
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
object so to give you an example

251
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,040
let me first start off by selecting this

252
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,440
icon which says create a new sketch

253
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,279
you have to choose a plane where you

254
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,040
need it to be and

255
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,640
for each plane there's also a reverse

256
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
direction so total of six

257
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
directions that you can choose plus an

258
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,920
offset click ok

259
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
and that brings up this two dimensional

260
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,360
drawing window

261
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,000
which you can also using the alt key

262
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
move like so

263
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,880
but you'd like to keep it visible flat

264
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
there are a couple of sections on the

265
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,320
left you have

266
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,720
a section called solver messages the

267
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,519
other one called

268
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,040
constraints and the third called

269
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
elements a quick look at the

270
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,279
toolbar that has appeared over here the

271
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,240
one you see here

272
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,480
allows you to draw several graphical

273
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,839
elements like a point

274
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,200
a line arc circle ellipse b spline

275
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,200
a polyline rectangle polygons

276
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,320
ovals or slots you can add a fillet

277
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,480
you can cut a line you can extend the

278
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
line and so on

279
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,560
and these are the constraint settings

280
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,680
these let you

281
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,079
constrain your objects for example two

282
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,680
points can be made coincidence

283
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,320
a point can be made tangential to a

284
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,120
curved line

285
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,360
or even to a straight line this adds a

286
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,279
vertical constraint to a line this one

287
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,120
has a horizontal constraint

288
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
this one has a parallel constraint this

289
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,320
one is right angle for two

290
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,480
right angle lines this one is a line

291
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,360
tangent to an

292
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
arc or a circle this is an equality so

293
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
two circles of equal radius or arcs of

294
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,760
equal radius so

295
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,279
lines of equal length this one is

296
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
equality constraint so if you want a

297
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,040
line

298
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,000
equidistant along the y-axis you can use

299
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,959
this to

300
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,160
achieve that if there are some

301
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,839
elements that you want to just lock out

302
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,120
you are providing constraints or

303
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
dimensions you can do that and

304
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,880
freecad will consider it as a fixed

305
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
constraint

306
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,480
this allows you to add a horizontal

307
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,240
dimension to a line this allows you to

308
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,079
add a vertical dimension to either line

309
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:06,880
or two points

310
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,320
same thing with this allows you to fix

311
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,079
the distance between a point and a line

312
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,040
for example

313
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,880
this sets the radius of the diameter of

314
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
an arc or a circle this sets the angle

315
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,920
between two lines

316
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,399
and so on so with a quick walkthrough

317
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,959
let's make a sketch here's the rectangle

318
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,519
icon let me click once and drag and

319
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,720
place it here so that's our rectangle

320
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
and it has four degrees of freedom the

321
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,279
width

322
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,000
the height and the position of one of

323
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,079
the vertices with respect to the origin

324
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:38,959
zero zero

325
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,040
those are the four constraints that we

326
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,959
need to fix before this becomes

327
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,360
a fully constrained sketch in order to

328
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,640
do that

329
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,760
we want to set the width

330
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,600
as let's say 2.375

331
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,720
inches the height

332
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,680
as 1.8 inch

333
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,320
and now we want to make it equidistant

334
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,760
along the x and y

335
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,839
axis there are two ways of doing this

336
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,800
you can select these two

337
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,720
points and the x-axis and

338
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,600
give an equality constraint like that

339
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,680
and repeat that in the y-axis with these

340
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,880
two points

341
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,839
and the vertical axis and creating

342
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,880
another

343
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,920
constraint like that the other way

344
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,040
is to take these two opposing vertices

345
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,000
and the center one and create an

346
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,839
equality constraint that does the same

347
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,560
thing as me

348
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,160
so we have a fully constrained sketch

349
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,320
now we can close this and we can now

350
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,959
apply

351
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,600
an extrude operation on this for which

352
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,120
we go back to part

353
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,800
workbench and here is the extrude

354
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,959
option once you do that you get a

355
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,360
another dialog box where you set the

356
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,800
height we wanted it to be

357
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,399
0.25 and say

358
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,839
okay so that extrudes this

359
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,160
box in this direction and this is where

360
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,600
things get a little bit better than

361
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,320
having used

362
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,360
just primitives i can choose this face

363
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,959
can go to sketcher again

364
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,040
and create a sketch where it asks me how

365
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,639
that sketch needs to be attached

366
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,440
to this face flat face is what you need

367
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
usually so click ok

368
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,079
and you get back to sketcher and we can

369
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,720
now

370
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,839
make another rectangle here

371
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,079
but now we know that the wall thickness

372
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,480
of this enclosure needs to be 0.1 inch

373
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,560
so this rectangle is going to be 0.1

374
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:38,959
inch

375
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,120
shorter than the outer rectangle on all

376
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,399
the four sides now

377
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,880
we can do that using the outer rectangle

378
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,920
as references

379
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,480
and that happens using this icon which

380
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,279
says

381
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,040
create an edge linked to an external

382
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,519
geometry if you click on that

383
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,920
and if i click the left edge and the

384
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,639
right edge

385
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,320
that provides me the four corner

386
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,839
vertices of the

387
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,160
bigger cube as references i can then

388
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,040
press escape

389
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,920
to get out of that mode without giving

390
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,839
any dimensions to this rectangle

391
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,240
i can just set these references the

392
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,079
horizontal distance between these two

393
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:12,639
points

394
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,560
set it using this as 0.1 inch and

395
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,040
the vertical distance between these two

396
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,000
points

397
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,279
is also 0.1 inch

398
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,440
i do the same for the other corner and

399
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,560
that's all i need to do

400
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,639
select the two points horizontal 0.1

401
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,120
and once again select the two points

402
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,880
vertical

403
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,120
0.1 and now it is fully constrained

404
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,320
with respect to the earlier

405
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,519
rectangle like so and now i can

406
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,320
go back to part and unfortunately the

407
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,720
part

408
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,040
workbench doesn't allow you to cut out a

409
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,720
hollow over here using this

410
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,360
so you have to do the extrude function

411
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,839
again

412
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,040
and then do a boolean to cut out the

413
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,720
hollow let's go to extrude and

414
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,880
i don't want anything along because

415
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,000
that's along the

416
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,120
vertically upwards direction but against

417
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,199
i want it at 0.15

418
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,720
and click ok so that's extruded

419
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,680
in the other direction i can hide an

420
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
element by selecting it and pressing the

421
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,199
space bar like so so that

422
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,160
is the bigger rectangle hidden and

423
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,120
that's unhidden

424
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
and that's the smaller one hidden and

425
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,440
unhidden now i can do a boolean between

426
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,000
these two

427
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,120
select extrude select the other one

428
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,040
make a cut and i get a hollow like so

429
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,959
let's view this in wireframe like so

430
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,920
and let's add some fillets to the corner

431
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,120
let's pick the internal

432
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,399
vertical corners like so i need to use

433
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,079
the control key to make multiple

434
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,639
selections so first corner second corner

435
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,680
third corner and fourth corner and use

436
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,720
this tool to

437
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,839
apply a fillet and give a

438
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,399
value it was one six

439
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,440
inch click okay so that's

440
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,279
fillet on the inside we can do the same

441
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,040
for the outside select one edge

442
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,600
and then using ctrl select the other

443
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,240
three

444
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,120
vertical corners select the fillet

445
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,759
option

446
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,800
and this will be 0.26

447
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,600
wall thickness is 0.1 inch so there it

448
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,240
is

449
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,600
now let's go back to v2 and

450
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,240
that's your solid object like so and

451
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,759
this is how you keep building

452
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,639
a solid object again we can add another

453
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,320
sketch over here to act as

454
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,199
four corner posts or screws of the pcb

455
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:39,920
but

456
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,160
once again this is really not the best

457
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,120
way of

458
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,880
doing proper cad model let me save this

459
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,560
file before we go any further so

460
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,880
let's put that under our folders freecad

461
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,839
all right so compared to using the part

462
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,120
and the sketcher

463
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,079
workbenches a better way to do this is

464
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,199
to use the

465
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,160
part design workbench and before we go

466
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,439
any further let me just

467
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,439
delete what we've done because we don't

468
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,039
really need it anymore

469
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,319
yeah let me just save this once again

470
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,119
and the part design workbench is a

471
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,119
little bit more powerful compared to

472
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,319
the combination of part and sketcher the

473
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,640
art design workbench also still depends

474
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,160
on the sketcher to make the basic

475
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,880
sketches

476
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,360
but the integration between the two is

477
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,280
much more better so let's see how we can

478
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,880
achieve the same thing which we did in

479
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,799
the previous example using the

480
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,760
part design workbench so the concept

481
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,799
with part design

482
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,160
is you create bodies and each body

483
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,200
is one specific part of your design so

484
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
for example if we are making an

485
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,440
enclosure for our circuit board which is

486
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,039
over here and we want it to be in in

487
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,679
two sections the bottom part and the top

488
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,240
part

489
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,960
then we will have to have two bodies in

490
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,080
our free cat design

491
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,240
one for the bottom and one for the top

492
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,440
so let's start off by creating a body

493
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,520
and if you look at the model tree you

494
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,960
will have a body

495
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,400
available there and also the origin of

496
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,039
that body let's select body then go to

497
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:19,520
task

498
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,760
and the next step is to create a sketch

499
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,120
so click on

500
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,840
sketch and it needs to know which plane

501
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,960
you want to do it

502
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,280
the sketch in let's choose the x5 plane

503
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,080
which is the top

504
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,960
view click ok and that brings us back to

505
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,760
sketcher

506
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,080
we can repeat the same procedure as we

507
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,919
did earlier quickly we can make

508
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,360
a rectangle like so escape

509
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,400
we can give it a horizontal dimension

510
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,080
of 2.375 inches

511
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,919
a vertical height of 1.8

512
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,600
inches and choose these two points

513
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,640
and the origin

514
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,480
the order is important again you have to

515
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,400
choose the two end points first and

516
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,280
the center point last and then choose

517
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,840
the

518
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,080
equality constraint but let's say we

519
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,600
want to have a more complex

520
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,360
sketch to start with we want to include

521
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,280
the fillets over here choose the fillet

522
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,679
tool

523
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,919
click on one line and click on the other

524
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,840
that creates the fillet and keep doing

525
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,480
this for

526
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,320
all of the corners where you want the

527
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,960
fillets that's the third corner

528
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,880
that's the fourth press escape to get

529
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
out of the fillet mode

530
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,520
i want all of these fillers to have the

531
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,039
same radius so choose

532
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,200
all four of them click once click twice

533
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
no need to do control over here

534
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,760
just keep clicking all the arcs you want

535
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,320
to choose

536
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,440
then use this constrain radius tool

537
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,400
to select the same radius for all the

538
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
four arcs that you've selected so

539
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,280
say yes and we wanted this to be

540
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,600
0.16 sorry

541
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,520
so that's the arc set we still have four

542
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,200
degrees of freedom again the width

543
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,600
height

544
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,960
and the center point let's first set the

545
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,919
width of this so choose this point and

546
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,799
choose

547
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,360
this point and make it 2.375

548
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,919
inches wide choose this point choose

549
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:10,960
this point

550
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,039
and make it 1.8 inches

551
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,000
tall and maybe we can just make the

552
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,200
center of these

553
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,520
filler corners equidistant around the

554
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,559
center point

555
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,600
to fix the location of our

556
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,080
sketch let's close that that's what it

557
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,720
looks like

558
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,200
and on this sketch we can then add a pad

559
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,039
operation which is in extrude

560
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,280
so click on pad it asks you for a

561
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,720
dimension so

562
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,799
choose 0.25 you can reverse it

563
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,200
you can we have it symmetric along the

564
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,919
plane

565
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,240
then click ok and here's where things

566
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
get better compared to the previous

567
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,600
example that we saw

568
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,080
we can now select the top face and

569
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,880
create

570
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,320
a sketch on it where we can again

571
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,960
draw instead of a rectangle let me show

572
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,640
you how to draw a polyline

573
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,679
so the polyline tool is over here and

574
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,520
we are going to follow this outline and

575
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,360
create a similar

576
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,400
rectangle and then we'll set it with

577
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,440
reference to the

578
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,039
outside rectangle so let me

579
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,679
go to wireframe mode so it's easier to

580
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,039
see what i'm doing

581
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,640
so here's the polyline tool i click once

582
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,679
and i draw a horizontal line like this

583
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,640
then i want an arc over here so this is

584
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,600
still a line

585
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,880
the next option is a vertical line

586
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,000
next option is a horizontal line there

587
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,480
is a

588
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,679
outside arc then

589
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,880
a pi like this then an inside arc and

590
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,440
back to

591
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,880
straight line so we want this

592
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,960
over here to choose that click once

593
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,720
secondary click and move to press

594
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,080
m twice to get a vertical line

595
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,200
like so then press

596
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,200
m thrice to get the arc scroll again

597
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,120
m twice to get a line m

598
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,840
tries to get the arc

599
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,720
and twice to get a line

600
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,159
and finally m3 times to get a arc

601
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,000
but you wanted to join up with the

602
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,640
starting point so make sure that

603
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,280
when you do it the points turn yellow at

604
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,240
which point

605
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,559
they are connected like so now we have

606
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,679
to give several

607
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,159
constraints to this sketch first of all

608
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,159
each of the arcs needs to be connected

609
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,200
to the line

610
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,000
through a tangent constraint like so you

611
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
can see it here but not over here so we

612
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,640
choose this

613
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,440
arc and this line and here's the tangent

614
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,120
constraint

615
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,760
make sure all the four corners have that

616
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
here's the tangent but

617
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,600
not over here so choose these two make

618
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,320
them

619
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,240
tangential click ok this is a tangent

620
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,720
but not this so choose those two make

621
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,480
them

622
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,559
tangent and finally same here

623
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,919
make them tangent click ok

624
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,200
let's select the four corner arcs one

625
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,240
two three and four and

626
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,200
just make them equal to start with then

627
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,320
we want the

628
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
center of these arcs to be coincident

629
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,440
with the center of the

630
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,159
arc of the external rectangle so we will

631
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:28,960
have to use

632
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
that as an external reference and that

633
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,200
happens via this toolbar icon over here

634
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,400
which says create an

635
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,880
edge linked to an external geometry so

636
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,840
let's select that

637
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,120
icon and click on the four corner arcs

638
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,799
of our earlier sketch this gives us

639
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,440
access to the center point of those arcs

640
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
so now let me press escape to get out of

641
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:49,919
this

642
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,120
mode choose these two center points

643
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,279
and make them coincident using this

644
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,400
constraint

645
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,480
these two constraint

646
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,600
these two constraint and

647
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
this might not be necessary let's see if

648
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,880
this causes it to go

649
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,760
over constrained yes the three of them

650
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,799
are good enough

651
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,520
so with that constraint we have just one

652
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,400
degree of

653
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,640
freedom left which is essentially the

654
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,440
gap between these two rectangles or

655
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,559
what would be the thickness of our

656
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,880
enclosure like this so we can set that

657
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,960
by choosing any two points like this

658
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
this one for example and giving it a

659
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,039
vertical dimension of

660
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,320
0.1 inch and close this

661
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,880
now let me go back because i think i

662
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,640
made a mistake in the

663
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,120
radius for the arc on the larger

664
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,400
rectangle so let me

665
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,679
go back one step to pad and

666
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,760
under pad you'll notice the original

667
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,440
sketch that we have drawn so double

668
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,320
click on that

669
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,000
let's come back here and check yes so

670
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,080
this is 0.16 it should have been 0.26

671
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,240
because this is the outside arc so click

672
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,640
ok close this

673
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,840
and close that and now if we inspect

674
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,799
this sketch

675
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,120
you'll notice that this is also adapted

676
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,080
to this change

677
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,679
because it is related to the earlier

678
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,400
sketch that we have made so now that we

679
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,039
have this

680
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,840
second sketch ready let's make a pocket

681
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,080
operation in this by going to task

682
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,720
and selecting the pocket command let's

683
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,000
look at the

684
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,840
front view so we can see what's

685
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,520
happening like so

686
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,960
and we want it to have a base thickness

687
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,159
of 0.1

688
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,799
inch which means pocket depth needs to

689
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,480
be 0.15

690
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,440
inches and click ok and this is where we

691
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,640
are let's go back to

692
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,200
flight line view and if you compare this

693
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,120
process with the earlier one this is

694
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,480
much more powerful it's easier to modify

695
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,440
and change it

696
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,640
and the results are the same so at this

697
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,679
point we have

698
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,799
done a pretty quick rundown of the

699
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,559
sketcher part and part design

700
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,679
workbenches there is

701
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,240
a lot more that needs to be shown but

702
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,000
what i'd like to do is first show you

703
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,480
the

704
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,880
powerful kicad step-up tools workbench

705
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,000
because that allows

706
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,159
integration between kai-cad and free

707
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,760
karen let me just

708
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,200
get rid of all of this

709
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,159
okay so let's start by

710
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,000
getting the kycat step-up tools

711
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,440
workbench from this

712
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,480
drop down over here and there's a big

713
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,880
huge range of tools toolbar icons

714
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,520
available

715
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,679
so i'm going to make it easy and just

716
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,880
point you to the ones

717
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,480
that are really useful the first thing

718
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,200
to do is select the first icon which is

719
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,279
edit preferences which is the same as

720
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,400
the edit menu preferences and go down to

721
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
the last section on the left

722
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,039
which says skycade step up tools and

723
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,520
make sure that the main 3d folder

724
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,320
location

725
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,400
is the same as the one you have selected

726
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,080
in kicad which is your

727
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,200
kai says 3d mod folder location if you

728
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,600
have

729
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
additional 3d models in some other

730
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,440
folders we can add that as an

731
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,080
alternative 3d folder location

732
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,320
make sure that you check the pcb

733
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,760
placement which should be at

734
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,320
a grid origin because that is what we

735
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,919
have set as the center of

736
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,679
our pcb in kaikel so with that done we

737
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,559
can close

738
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,520
preferences next thing to do is select

739
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,039
the second icon

740
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,279
that brings up the main kicad step-up

741
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,960
tools toolbar

742
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,760
let me just keep it here on this side

743
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,039
most of the functions

744
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,240
on this toolbar are related to aligning

745
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,000
models with footprints and

746
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,240
this is what the initial functionality

747
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,320
of this workbench was and then over time

748
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,080
a lot of other functions have been added

749
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,640
which

750
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,720
resulted in a lot of these additional

751
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
icons over here

752
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,159
it may look intimidating but it's not

753
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,440
all that difficult

754
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,760
so the first thing we're trying to do is

755
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,120
import our kai-cad

756
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,880
pcb over here then modify its outline to

757
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,200
have a more complex shape then push

758
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
those changes back to kai-ket

759
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,679
and then we have to pull those changes

760
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,520
back into freecad once more to complete

761
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,640
the whole process so

762
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
let's see how that works you open your

763
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,720
kaikai pcb using the third icon over

764
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,200
here which says load kayak pcb board and

765
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,679
parts

766
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,679
then you go to the folder where you have

767
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,720
your project

768
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,000
like and select the icad pcb

769
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,520
it pulls up the board and populates it

770
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,120
with all of the parts

771
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,200
that it finds tells you where the center

772
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,320
of the pcb is

773
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,480
and you can select click okay so that's

774
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,000
your package pcb

775
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,039
with all the parts on it now let's look

776
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,080
at the top view

777
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,120
what we'd like to do is add fillets on

778
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,320
these two corners

779
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,120
and maybe also add a little cut out here

780
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,799
in the middle of the board on the left

781
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,200
side so that it's easy for you to insert

782
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,440
and

783
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,600
extract the coin cells so we're going to

784
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,559
modify this

785
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,120
outline if you look at the projectory on

786
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,679
the

787
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,320
left the the tiny blinky board when you

788
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,600
expand it as

789
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,159
two groups both geometries and step

790
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:00,720
models

791
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,960
if you expand step models you'll find

792
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,240
two additional

793
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,399
groups if you have parts on both sides

794
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,320
or if you have paths only one side then

795
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,080
you'll find just one group that says

796
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,559
top and expanding that shows you all of

797
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,640
the step models that are placed on the

798
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,960
top of the pcb here's your battery

799
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,200
here's your electrolytic capacitor disc

800
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,080
capacitor

801
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,760
led and so on and like with any free cad

802
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,520
object you can hide it by pressing the

803
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,039
space bar you can

804
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,279
move it using the placement properties

805
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,640
so let's

806
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,559
collapse that for the moment because

807
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,240
what we're interested in is the board

808
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,760
geometries when you do that

809
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,399
the pcb object you see is the pcb you

810
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,240
can hide that

811
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,200
and just next to it is the sketch which

812
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,640
contains just the outline

813
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,799
of the pcb that you have imported so

814
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,559
let's hide the pcb and

815
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,440
unhide the sketch which we would like to

816
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,279
now modify so let's uh

817
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,679
double click this that brings up

818
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,799
sketcher

819
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,960
and there are a large number of degrees

820
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,720
of freedom because none of these have

821
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,120
any constraints at the moment

822
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,520
for some of those elements for which we

823
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,200
don't want to add constraints

824
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,240
and yet reduce this under constraint

825
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
nature of our sketch what we can do is

826
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,679
select them and

827
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,480
use a toolbar icon that says lock or

828
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,360
create a block

829
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,840
item that prevents those items from

830
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,559
being

831
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,880
modified or changed so we can choose

832
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,559
this toolbar icon first

833
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,880
create a block constraint and then let's

834
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,240
select

835
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,559
all of these paths on the right side of

836
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,159
the board the two arcs

837
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,039
this horizontal segment another arc this

838
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,320
vertical segment

839
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,080
another arc horizontal segment

840
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,679
arc arc so so these are locked

841
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,279
we can't move them now let's escape this

842
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,279
function let's add a couple of

843
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,039
constraints to these remaining three

844
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:51,600
lines you

845
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,159
we know these two horizontal lines need

846
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:54,640
to have

847
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,760
a horizontal constraint like so and this

848
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,279
vertical line is to have a vertical

849
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,000
constraint

850
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
so now we have just one degree of

851
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,039
freedom which

852
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,919
is most likely the width of the board so

853
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:06,880
now we can add

854
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,720
fillets at the two corners and a little

855
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,240
cut out here and

856
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,360
modify our outline let's use the

857
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,120
fillet feature like over here choose

858
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,399
these two lines and then repeat it

859
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,960
with the other two then escape the

860
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,120
fillet feature

861
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,960
select both of these arcs

862
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,760
select one of these arcs because we want

863
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,919
these two arcs to have the same radius

864
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:34,320
as

865
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,240
any one of these arcs and they are all

866
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,840
of the same radius

867
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,600
so we have chosen these three arcs and

868
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,000
then we choose the equality constraint

869
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,159
make sure that these arcs have the same

870
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,039
radius as

871
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,240
the ones on the other side and

872
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,640
we finally have the width of the board

873
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,480
that needs to be set so let's select

874
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,600
this end point and this end point and

875
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,720
the overall width

876
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,279
of our board is set with this horizontal

877
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,360
constraint at

878
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,679
2.8 inches click ok

879
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,360
and bring it here so we have a

880
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,960
constrained sketch but

881
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,519
we still need to add a slot or a cutout

882
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,600
over here so let's just kind of add a

883
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,720
wedge kind of

884
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,159
shape to do that we can use the polyline

885
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:16,880
feature

886
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,600
start here make an angle line then a

887
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,799
vertical line

888
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,120
and another angle line and something

889
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,159
like this would

890
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,720
work quite well then press escape to end

891
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,159
the polyline function

892
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,640
if you don't get this tangent icon over

893
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,480
here make sure that your line

894
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,200
is tangential to this by selecting the

895
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,600
line

896
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,360
and the point and then applying the

897
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,640
tangent icon

898
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,840
over here now the other thing i need to

899
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,159
do

900
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,720
is make sure that this line is

901
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,600
equidistant along the x-axis so select

902
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,120
the two end points of this line and the

903
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,159
horizontal x-axis and make that

904
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,320
equidistant or symmetrical around the

905
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,399
x-axis

906
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,640
give an angle to this line so between

907
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,919
these two lines let's

908
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,320
make a 45 degree angle that would make

909
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,600
it 1

910
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,200
35 degrees and

911
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,279
repeat the same angle on the other side

912
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,799
so select the vertical line

913
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,760
select the angle line choose the angle

914
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,640
constraint

915
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,320
and apply 135 degrees

916
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,519
there as well all right so we have these

917
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,559
two constraints

918
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,360
set now let's set the width of this slot

919
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,080
by

920
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,720
selecting this vertical line and giving

921
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,640
it a vertical constraint of

922
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,159
maybe 0.2 inches should be

923
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,919
probably enough maybe we should increase

924
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,720
it some more 0.24

925
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,240
and uh finally this gap

926
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,360
needs to be set so let's say we bring it

927
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,799
somewhere over here like this

928
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,039
and see what this distance is so i

929
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,360
choose the two end points of this

930
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,279
inclined line and set the horizontal

931
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,200
distance as let's say 0.12

932
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,279
all right so constrained sketch but we

933
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,720
want to get rid of this

934
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,360
segment over here so let's use the trim

935
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,000
and edge

936
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,560
command click here once it gives us

937
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,639
another two degrees of freedom

938
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,679
which would be selecting these two

939
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,879
vertical lines and making those equal

940
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,199
one and then choosing any one of them

941
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,560
and selecting what

942
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,679
its height is i guess yeah

943
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,040
so 0.42 inches click ok

944
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,599
and we have a constrained sketch here

945
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,199
where we have added fillets on two

946
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,599
corners and a notch through which

947
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,359
make it easier for us to insert and

948
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,119
extract the coins so let's

949
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,520
close this and this is the revised

950
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,320
outline

951
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,359
and this is the original pcb so we want

952
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:45,760
to

953
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,800
change this pcb into this outline

954
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,879
the way you do it once you have got all

955
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,399
of this done in sketchup

956
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,760
you select this icon which says push

957
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,880
sketch to pcb edge if your toolbar

958
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,400
locations are a bit different you might

959
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:00,880
have to

960
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,359
look around for it push sketch to pcb

961
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,079
choose that

962
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,040
okay there's a warning select one sketch

963
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,920
to be pushed to

964
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,040
kai-cat board so let's repeat again

965
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,640
i select a sketch click on push sketch

966
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,440
to pcb select which layer it needs to be

967
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,040
in on the edge cuts layer

968
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,800
line width and click ok then select the

969
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,760
pcb where

970
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,160
this bold edge needs to be pushed click

971
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,880
save

972
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,839
and click yes so that's done click ok of

973
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:30,400
this

974
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,920
let's just kind of save this

975
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,280
and do that now let's go back to kaicad

976
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,119
and see if this has really worked

977
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,640
this is our existing

978
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,480
board outline like so i'm going to close

979
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:46,880
this

980
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,359
i'm going to close this as well and then

981
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,079
restart

982
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,280
pcb new so that it can load the

983
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,640
new outline hopefully which is here

984
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,400
we can't see it well in this so let me

985
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,160
turn off some other layers five layers

986
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,480
go

987
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,920
courtyard go and maybe the bottom copper

988
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,760
so here's our new edge and we can check

989
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,240
it out

990
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,119
in 3d view you can see the zone sticking

991
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,880
out here so we'll have to regenerate

992
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,359
that

993
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,640
we'll also have to relocate the logo so

994
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:16,880
it

995
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,200
doesn't get chopped off and there might

996
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,400
be a ground track

997
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,800
going under this notch so we might have

998
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,520
to

999
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,440
redraw that so those are the changes

1000
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,119
we'll have to do to this

1001
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,760
board let's check that out so first off

1002
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,400
let me

1003
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,880
switch off the front silk so i can see

1004
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,240
things better

1005
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,720
and on the bottom silk i choose the

1006
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,520
hackaday

1007
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,320
text logo click on it once click m to

1008
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,800
move it

1009
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,800
and kind of move it up like so so it

1010
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,520
doesn't get

1011
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,200
chopped off there that should be good

1012
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,880
enough in which case i'll have to

1013
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,280
probably move this colon wrenches

1014
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,160
slightly below so choose that m to move

1015
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,720
it

1016
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,599
and using the down arrow key move it

1017
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:57,920
down

1018
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,720
like so so that looks good let's just

1019
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,920
save this

1020
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,640
then let's hide front copper and unhide

1021
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
bottom copper

1022
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,599
hide the fill in the bottom copper core

1023
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,720
and let's check this out

1024
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,800
it's likely we should just shift it a

1025
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,160
little bit so

1026
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,240
it doesn't interfere with the edge let's

1027
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,680
just do that let me

1028
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,520
select the bottom layer let me select

1029
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,200
the tracks and

1030
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,640
start from here and do something like

1031
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,280
that

1032
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
and then press b once again to

1033
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,880
regenerate the

1034
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,560
zone looks better

1035
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,920
so we have that done let's just

1036
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,000
re-enable all the layers front copper

1037
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,680
front silk

1038
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,640
courtyards and fabs click home to see

1039
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,440
all of it

1040
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,839
let's run a drc to see if there are any

1041
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:48,640
errors

1042
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,200
around drc everything looks good close

1043
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,000
this

1044
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,119
and save it and now if we go back to

1045
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,440
freecad you'll notice that we have the

1046
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,200
board outline as a sketch

1047
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,359
but not the physical board itself

1048
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,680
because we need to still pull it from

1049
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,920
kaicad for the changes to be finally

1050
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,040
updated over here

1051
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,839
so that happens using this fifth icon

1052
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,079
over here which is pull sketch from pcb

1053
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,680
so in the previous step what happened

1054
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,119
was we pushed the

1055
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,839
sketch from freecad to kaiket and now

1056
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,599
what we are trying to do is pull the

1057
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,839
sketch from kaicat to freecad the other

1058
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:22,400
way around

1059
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,280
so let's click on that once select layer

1060
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
open a new document

1061
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,440
no i want to replace pcb and sketch in

1062
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,560
current document

1063
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,880
and click ok choose the board click open

1064
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,680
and look at the top view here we are

1065
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,760
maybe the sketch is still

1066
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,160
visible so let me go to board geometries

1067
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,960
and

1068
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,240
hide the sketch like so

1069
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,200
cool so we have made quite a bit of

1070
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
modification to the left edge of the

1071
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:51,680
board

1072
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,839
using freecad then exported those

1073
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,040
changes to kaicad

1074
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,040
saved it all in kai ked and then

1075
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,040
imported those changes back into freecad

1076
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,000
to update our board

1077
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,280
over here so that's how board or edge

1078
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,440
cuts layer push pull works in

1079
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,680
freecad using the kai-cad step-up tools

1080
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,359
workbench let's look at a similar

1081
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,040
process that works for

1082
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,359
the parts that are placed on the board

1083
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,040
when you're designing an enclosure for

1084
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,640
this it's likely that you will come

1085
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,240
across certain cases where

1086
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,640
things are interfering or you need to

1087
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,920
move some part

1088
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,400
slightly away from its existing location

1089
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,480
maybe a switch or a connector so that it

1090
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,560
aligns properly with whatever

1091
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,839
design you have in mind for the

1092
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,480
enclosure so let's figure out how we can

1093
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:32,880
move

1094
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,599
a part in freecad and then have those

1095
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,040
changes reflect back in

1096
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,920
kaican and then re-import modifications

1097
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,839
back into free care like we did with the

1098
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,599
edge cast okay let's select the switch

1099
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,599
let's say we want to move the switch

1100
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,000
and possibly even rotate it 90 degrees

1101
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,320
from where it is now what i can do is

1102
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,800
right click on the switch and click on

1103
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,599
transform

1104
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,000
at this point i can use the blue sphere

1105
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,720
to rotate

1106
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,920
my switch by 90 degrees like so

1107
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,040
and i can move it

1108
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,400
0.3 inches in the x direction

1109
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,160
and 0.1 inches in the y direction

1110
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,319
save this and maybe i could have done

1111
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,200
the same with

1112
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,680
the program header as well but for the

1113
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,359
moment let's just take one example to

1114
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,240
keep things

1115
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,720
simple so we figure out how it works so

1116
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,839
we have a

1117
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,520
we have this board in which one of the

1118
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,680
parts position has been changed we want

1119
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,640
to push this to

1120
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,440
kaiken that happens using the third icon

1121
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,800
over here that says push

1122
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,760
3d moved models to the pcb for that to

1123
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,040
happen you have to make sure that

1124
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,880
the model that you want to push has been

1125
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,599
selected so we have the switch selected

1126
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,760
and we choose this toolbar icon that

1127
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,160
says push 3d move models to pcb

1128
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,480
select the pcb where you want to push it

1129
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,319
and save it and click

1130
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,400
yes it will warn you that the new model

1131
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,079
position has been pushed to the kaikai

1132
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,760
board but there were tracks that it

1133
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,800
found which were

1134
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
connected to this component so you need

1135
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,720
to fix your routing so we click

1136
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,560
ok to this we go back to cad

1137
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,520
let's close this and open it again so we

1138
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,280
refresh our board

1139
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,119
or schematic click on this icon let's

1140
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,960
look at where our switch is here it is

1141
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,480
so let me

1142
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,119
hide the bottom copper and silk

1143
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,680
also hide the fabricate and courtyard

1144
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,560
layers here

1145
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,480
so here it is the switch position has

1146
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,560
changed and some of the tracks are now

1147
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,000
no longer connected

1148
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,240
sometimes it's easier to just rip those

1149
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
tracks away so i'm just going to delete

1150
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,440
this one track

1151
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,680
delete this track and delete this track

1152
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,960
as well all right

1153
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,160
and then make sure selected top layer

1154
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,280
click on the route tracks and

1155
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,480
let's start from here oh wait

1156
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,160
this is one track down that's the

1157
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,079
other track then let's choose this

1158
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,440
and do the five volt

1159
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,880
and three like so

1160
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,839
we have connected everything properly

1161
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:08,960
let me

1162
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,319
unhide all the layers

1163
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,319
save it regenerate the zone

1164
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,440
and let's run a drc

1165
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,119
and it says it found a courtyard overlap

1166
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,680
this is most likely between our program

1167
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,960
header and our switch

1168
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,839
which is over here let's look at the

1169
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,000
fourteen overlaps

1170
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,280
and let's hide the fab like so so

1171
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,440
a little bit of an overlap let me see if

1172
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,400
we can

1173
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,440
check this in freecad because the kycat

1174
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
step-up tool has a collision detect

1175
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,359
feature not sure if it'll look for this

1176
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,560
but we can try

1177
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,319
here it is this one says check

1178
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,319
collisions and interferences we

1179
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,240
probably need to select two parts for it

1180
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,560
to do that so we have switch

1181
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,920
and we want to check with the this one

1182
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,359
so we have these two parts

1183
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,599
selected and let's see if it can detect

1184
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,359
collisions between the two

1185
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,839
nothing you click on it nothing happens

1186
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,520
let's see if we can move it some more

1187
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,079
and

1188
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,280
cause it to have a collision let's

1189
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,079
translate this switch some more maybe

1190
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,280
another 0.1 inch

1191
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,359
this should obviously show up as an

1192
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,599
error for sure

1193
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,800
select the switch select the header

1194
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,839
and look for collisions and this is the

1195
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,920
overlap between these two parts that it

1196
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,599
has found so that's how you look for

1197
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,400
collisions

1198
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,960
in package step upgrades let me your

1199
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,160
control c

1200
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,640
and

1201
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,920
undo that yeah all right so let's go

1202
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,960
back to

1203
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,160
packet and this looks good

1204
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,880
but since we've come this far we

1205
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,079
probably can just

1206
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,640
move this switch a little bit away so we

1207
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,040
can

1208
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,680
pass a drc from here so i'm going to

1209
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,240
move it

1210
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,839
just a little bit like so

1211
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,440
place it here enable the front copper

1212
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,839
get rid of these tracks

1213
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,200
like so then select

1214
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,319
track routing on the on the

1215
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,680
top layer and

1216
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,319
that's one

1217
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,720
that's another

1218
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,560
and one last one

1219
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,640
and if we wanted to we could even have

1220
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,040
rotated this program header a bit but

1221
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,240
maybe

1222
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,920
i can leave it as an exercise for you

1223
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,079
folks to do it and

1224
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,200
try it out yourself to see how it works

1225
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,079
okay so let's regenerate our

1226
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,280
copper zone once again press b

1227
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,200
let's zoom out enable the layers

1228
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,480
and run a drc before we

1229
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,520
proceed so that's done that's my first

1230
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,640
layer

1231
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,759
click on drc

1232
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,119
so that's cleared our error

1233
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,480
in the drc and things look good

1234
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,000
let's make sure we save it

1235
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,240
and now we can go back to

1236
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,079
freecad so first let's make sure that we

1237
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,560
pull the most current footprint

1238
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,880
locations from kiket back into freecad

1239
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,200
so

1240
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,480
let's select the switch and pull

1241
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,359
3d model position of the switch from

1242
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,480
freecad back into kaiket

1243
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,839
select the board click open and

1244
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,040
click ok so this is the refresh location

1245
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,079
of the

1246
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,119
switch is pulled from kaicad into

1247
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,839
freecad

1248
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,760
now as a final step what we need to do

1249
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,200
is make sure that these

1250
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,319
drill holes they are also refreshed

1251
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,720
we are going to wrap it up by selecting

1252
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,720
the pull sketch from pcb edge

1253
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,040
option make sure you choose the replace

1254
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,839
pcb

1255
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,560
and sketch in current document and click

1256
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,440
ok

1257
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,960
choose the board click open and

1258
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,800
let's make sure we hide the

1259
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,400
sketch let's look at the top view

1260
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,079
and here we are so that's how you

1261
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,359
push and pull footprint positions from

1262
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,160
freecad

1263
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,800
into kayak head and back the other way

1264
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,079
around

1265
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,440
so we've done two things here we've

1266
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,440
modified the edge

1267
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,680
and we've changed the position of the

1268
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,520
one of the footprints and

1269
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,960
we have made sure the changes are

1270
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,040
updated in both freecad as well as

1271
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,200
kcat let's look at another feature of

1272
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,920
kaicad step-up tools workbench which is

1273
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,880
very useful

1274
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,920
and that is to align 3d models with

1275
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,480
kai-cad footprints this can be pretty

1276
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,599
useful because

1277
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,319
quite often when you download models

1278
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,079
they may not be aligned

1279
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,200
with the footprint that you have

1280
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,720
so let me start off by creating a new

1281
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,440
document

1282
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,640
and we are going to work on the battery

1283
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,960
retainer clip that we downloaded from

1284
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,839
keystone last time

1285
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,920
off i'll have to manipulate these step

1286
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,280
files i'm going to do a

1287
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,880
file import and get the

1288
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
model that we have downloaded from

1289
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,400
keystone now

1290
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,480
if you'll notice these are two separate

1291
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,160
parts but in the model t

1292
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,839
tree they appear as a single part which

1293
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,440
means that they have been fused

1294
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,319
during import and that is not what we

1295
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,760
want

1296
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,800
if this is what you see then the way to

1297
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,359
fix it

1298
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,559
is go to preferences under edit

1299
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,440
go to the import export section go to

1300
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,079
the step

1301
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,760
tab and if you have enable step compound

1302
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,319
merge

1303
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,040
check marked then remove the check mark

1304
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,319
click apply

1305
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,520
okay and now let's delete this

1306
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,440
and do the import once again

1307
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,040
and this time if you look at the model

1308
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,800
tree you'll notice that we have

1309
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,839
two individual separate parts imported

1310
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:20,559
over here

1311
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,839
next we need to figure out how to align

1312
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,040
both of these so that

1313
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,200
they line up with each other now

1314
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,920
one easy way of doing that is to call up

1315
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,400
the

1316
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,920
manipulator workbench and this is a nice

1317
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,800
handy

1318
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,599
caliper which is useful for making

1319
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,400
measurements

1320
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,040
so let's choose that and what we'd like

1321
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:43,520
to know

1322
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,640
is the distance between the bottom

1323
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,920
of the metal clip and the bottom of

1324
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,200
the plastic insulator and then offset

1325
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,559
one of the two objects so let's click on

1326
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,520
the

1327
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,280
measure button once zoom in so you can

1328
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,400
grab a corner of this middle retainer

1329
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,559
clip like so

1330
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,160
and scroll until you can

1331
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,680
grab this corner point and if you look

1332
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,079
at

1333
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,640
the values now we can see that in the

1334
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,480
y direction the offset is

1335
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,160
it's rounded off to 15 mm so we have

1336
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,559
this measurement available let's close

1337
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,800
the measure tool we can

1338
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,240
delete the distance labels now let's

1339
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,599
zoom all and the plastic

1340
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,680
insulator go to its position tab

1341
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,599
and in the y-axis this needs to be

1342
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,079
translated by a distance of 15

1343
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,359
millimeters now

1344
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,720
we are using imperial units here but

1345
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,400
in freecad you can actually enter

1346
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,280
even metric units while you are doing

1347
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,559
imperial

1348
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,839
drawings so this is nicely aligned now

1349
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,040
that solves a part of our problem next

1350
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,800
let's enable the toggle access crosses

1351
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,160
and just inspect our model

1352
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,440
and we can see that along the x-axis

1353
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,160
it is not centered and it doesn't look

1354
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,240
centered along the y-axis

1355
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,880
not along z as well so it's kind of

1356
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,880
offset in all of the three directions

1357
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,920
so let's create a reference object and

1358
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,119
we can move the battery retainer with

1359
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,880
reference to that object let's see if

1360
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,400
that works so

1361
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,520
let's go to the sketcher

1362
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,880
create a sketch in the

1363
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,520
x z plane but it needs to be reversed

1364
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,160
because

1365
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,319
i see the rear face over here so reverse

1366
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:49,680
direction

1367
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,880
and click okay zoom in a bit

1368
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,839
and all i want is some reference objects

1369
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:56,880
i can place

1370
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,800
even a rectangle like so over here

1371
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,960
click escape make both of its sides

1372
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,640
equal and then give it a dimension

1373
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,079
although all of this is really

1374
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,000
unnecessary all we need is this

1375
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,359
corner point over here but let's say

1376
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:16,640
that it's

1377
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,000
whatever this value is and close it

1378
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,280
so we now have this reference sketch now

1379
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,240
before we proceed further let's perform

1380
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,119
another action

1381
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,400
on our battery retainer which is to

1382
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,079
grab these two objects the metal clip

1383
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,040
and the plastic insulator and merge them

1384
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,119
again because now we have them moved

1385
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,160
and aligned with each other so we can go

1386
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,880
to the

1387
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,359
part workbench and after having selected

1388
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,000
both of them

1389
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,040
choose the union option

1390
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,960
that gives me this fusion object which

1391
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,440
is

1392
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,240
a single object that is easier for us to

1393
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,599
manipulate now

1394
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,880
let's reorient this object so that

1395
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,319
the top is facing where the top

1396
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,400
surface should be and the front is where

1397
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,359
the front should be

1398
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,559
and it's not aligned in those axis so

1399
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,760
let's go to transform let's rotate

1400
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,400
around

1401
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:14,590
the

1402
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,679
[Music]

1403
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,520
z-axis like so also rotate along the

1404
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,280
x-axis by so

1405
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,079
and then click okay let's now see if we

1406
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:28,640
can

1407
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,400
move the fusion object and

1408
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,599
have it align up with the origin

1409
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,960
so let's see if we can get the y

1410
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,240
axis offset worked out let me

1411
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,359
go to wireframe mode

1412
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,599
and then select the caliper tool

1413
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,640
click on caliper once

1414
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,040
choose this corner of the square that

1415
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,920
we've created

1416
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,000
click on an arc so we get the center and

1417
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,520
let's go back to top and

1418
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,319
check it out so in the y direction the

1419
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,040
offset is 1.027

1420
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:14,480
mm so let's close measure tools and

1421
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,720
see if we can move this by 1.027

1422
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,359
in the y-axis 1.027

1423
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,960
mm and

1424
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,240
click ok

1425
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,680
so we can now remove these two labels

1426
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,640
and just to verify let's go back to

1427
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,520
manipulator

1428
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,319
click on caliper clip on caliper we can

1429
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,280
select

1430
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,880
this end point and this circle and we

1431
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,760
can see that

1432
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,000
d y is now a pretty small number

1433
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,680
raised to negative zero five so

1434
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,839
maybe that's a rounding of error so we

1435
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,800
can

1436
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,000
close measure again get rid of these

1437
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,200
labels so we have things aligned along

1438
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:03,680
the

1439
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,720
y-axis let's see if we can get

1440
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,160
the same thing done along the x-axis

1441
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,800
let's go back to manipulator let's go

1442
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,839
back to

1443
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,960
the caliper and let's click on

1444
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,640
measure click on

1445
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,240
the origin vertex and then select

1446
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,079
this arc and in the x direction this

1447
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:28,720
offset

1448
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,400
is now 1.318

1449
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,920
mm so let's do that offset 1.318

1450
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,960
close this fusion x

1451
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,640
is minus 1.318

1452
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,920
millimeters like so

1453
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,960
now let's get rid of the earlier

1454
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,640
label and at the wrong direction it

1455
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,680
should have been a

1456
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,000
positive 1.0318 instead of negative

1457
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,839
so that is fixed looks pretty much

1458
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:06,640
centered now in the x direction so

1459
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,720
here's the isometric view

1460
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,920
and now let's see if we can fix

1461
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,520
things in the z direction so

1462
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,480
once again go to manipulator click on

1463
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:18,960
the

1464
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,480
vernier click on the one here

1465
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,079
click on the origin vertex and

1466
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,280
one of these lower end vertices this one

1467
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,079
should be

1468
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,200
good enough and in the z direction this

1469
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,920
is 11.414

1470
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,760
millimeters so let's get that

1471
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:45,680
fixed fusion 11.414

1472
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,119
millimeters like so click ok let's get

1473
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,880
rid of these

1474
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,559
distance labels let's hide the sketch

1475
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,280
that we have created let's go back to

1476
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,640
flat lines view

1477
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,160
and here's our battery retainer clip

1478
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,200
with the

1479
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,599
metal and the plastic insulator parts

1480
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:06,880
aligned with each other

1481
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,000
and then the whole body

1482
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,119
pretty much aligned along x y z

1483
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,839
0. so at this point i can take this

1484
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,040
fusion

1485
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,119
object and export it

1486
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,240
as a step file

1487
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,839
i can use the same name and append it

1488
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:30,880
with

1489
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,880
aligned so

1490
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,440
and save that so that's

1491
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,559
saved and at this point we

1492
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,760
are done with this object so we can

1493
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,559
close the file without really having to

1494
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:49,440
save it

1495
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,720
now let's again open up a new document

1496
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,720
so the next task is to import the

1497
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,000
footprint from

1498
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,119
kicad pcb and align this model

1499
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,680
with the footprint so let's go back to

1500
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,200
kaicad step up tools

1501
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,400
let's enable the primary toolbar

1502
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
so let's start off by importing the

1503
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,599
footprint

1504
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,920
for that choose the first icon over here

1505
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,520
which says load kaicad

1506
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,040
footprint go to your project folder

1507
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,079
under kai cad and a tiny blinky they

1508
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,079
should have a dot pretty folder

1509
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,240
and within that folder you should have

1510
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,160
your modified

1511
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,079
battery footprint which is a 3024-2

1512
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,680
so open that so that comes up over here

1513
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,640
so let's import the step model that we

1514
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,280
have created

1515
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,119
use the second icon here which says

1516
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,559
import step model

1517
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,760
now we get to the project folder under

1518
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,960
free cad we have

1519
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,520
saved the aligned step model which is

1520
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,119
the one we just created a couple of

1521
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,480
minutes ago

1522
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,000
open that so here's our

1523
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,400
step model and here's our footprint it

1524
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,160
needs to be rotated

1525
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,440
180 degrees along the z-axis

1526
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,480
so that is pretty easy

1527
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,359
you have these three rotation options

1528
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,160
over here

1529
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,200
rotate along x y and z and you can

1530
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:13,920
choose the

1531
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,079
angle over here we'll have to select the

1532
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,160
object first which is

1533
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,440
this one then rotate

1534
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,040
twice along the z-axis let's look at the

1535
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,079
top view

1536
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,559
and make sure that it is centered along

1537
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:29,280
the

1538
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,559
x-axis by using this icon center x

1539
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:35,520
so that fixes the centering on the x

1540
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,480
axis

1541
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,799
and i think center on y might not work

1542
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:39,920
because the

1543
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,160
outline of the existing footprint

1544
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,839
doesn't really match

1545
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,960
the actual model that we have so we can

1546
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,079
still try it

1547
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,480
there it doesn't line up so we'll have

1548
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,119
to

1549
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,799
align this manually by using the

1550
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,839
translation in the y-axis which is this

1551
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,119
icon over here now

1552
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,200
we'll have to probably do negative

1553
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,319
translation so

1554
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:05,520
negative 0.1

1555
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,880
and keep doing this

1556
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,160
let's zoom in to verify if it is aligned

1557
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,280
maybe one more step yes

1558
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,079
so that looks good enough so now i can

1559
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:20,960
export it

1560
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,359
let me choose this fusion first of all

1561
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:24,400
let me rename it

1562
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,240
by clicking on it and doing an f2

1563
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:33,040
and let's give it a name

1564
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:38,799
keystone underscore 3024-2

1565
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:42,079
so we select that and

1566
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,240
then we use this option here which says

1567
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,160
export to kaicad and

1568
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,640
it will export as i mentioned earlier in

1569
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,400
two different versions the step

1570
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,680
version and the vrml version so

1571
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,720
click here it wants you to save but

1572
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,000
i don't need to save this

1573
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,720
mesh deviation can be left as it is

1574
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,040
click

1575
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,160
ok crease angle click

1576
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,240
ok and here you can set fresh color so

1577
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,000
here's the original which is the chrome

1578
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,520
color and the new one

1579
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,440
can be set as something else if you'd

1580
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,720
like to

1581
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,160
and for now let's just click ok because

1582
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,359
that color is what we require and same

1583
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:24,799
thing with the

1584
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,520
color for the plastic insulator you can

1585
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,920
set a new color if you want to

1586
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,280
click ok and it has exported and saved

1587
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,920
these two files in this particular

1588
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,520
folder let's open it up

1589
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,559
here these two so i can now grab

1590
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,119
these two and transfer them to my

1591
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,359
project folder so i like to put

1592
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:52,319
these kind of models in within my kaicad

1593
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:53,920
directory

1594
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,799
itself by creating a new folder here

1595
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:02,160
which i like to call

1596
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,839
packages 3d

1597
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,559
and paste my 3d models over here so all

1598
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,760
local models that i need i push them in

1599
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,359
a folder like so within kycat

1600
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:20,880
so with that done we can now

1601
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,319
return back to our kaicad project

1602
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:27,599
and let's check it out first in

1603
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,040
3d view this is what the existing

1604
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,799
footprint looks like

1605
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:38,000
and also if you look at the

1606
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,920
settings in 3d we had to apply

1607
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,960
several rotation and offset

1608
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,040
values over here to make it line up with

1609
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,960
our footprint so

1610
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,319
let me delete this footprint and

1611
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,680
now using this icon i can ask it to use

1612
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,400
the

1613
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,760
footprint from my kaicad project folder

1614
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,039
under tiny blinky

1615
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,880
under packages the wrl

1616
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,680
model like so click ok so there it is

1617
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,680
nicely lined up no need to make any

1618
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,799
adjustments

1619
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:15,280
over here click ok let's save this

1620
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,400
view this in 3d viewer and

1621
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,640
there you have it we have finally

1622
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,640
managed to

1623
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,680
get a much more realistic model of

1624
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,720
our two coin battery retainer with a

1625
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,200
plastic insulator

1626
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,480
so let me close this and

1627
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,920
go back to freecad click ok here

1628
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,039
and i can now close this

1629
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:45,359
without saving it here's my

1630
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:48,720
tiny blinky project in free cad

1631
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,480
since what we have done in kai-cad is

1632
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,920
just changed the 3d model but not

1633
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,799
its position or the footprint it makes

1634
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,240
sense to

1635
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:04,000
kind of just delete this whole icad

1636
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,520
pcb file and re-import it all over again

1637
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,319
choosing this

1638
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,520
and reloading all of the parts open

1639
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,359
there's a new tab so we can

1640
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,799
close the earlier one without saving it

1641
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:25,119
and let's save this as

1642
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,400
our original file

1643
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,520
here's the top view so

1644
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,559
this completes the whole process of

1645
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,440
taking a step model making any

1646
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,400
adjustments

1647
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,200
that may be needed on it in terms of

1648
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,240
position

1649
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,359
rotation translation and so on and then

1650
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:49,599
opening up the kycade pcb footprint

1651
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:52,480
importing the step model aligning both

1652
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,359
of them together

1653
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,400
and exporting it all back again as

1654
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,200
a pair of models one in step format one

1655
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,599
in vrml format and then apply those

1656
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:02,240
changes

1657
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,119
in kai-ked and refresh those changes and

1658
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,400
freecad by

1659
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,240
re-importing the whole file all over

1660
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,839
again

1661
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,200
so that is about all that we can cover

1662
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:13,839
today

1663
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:16,720
in this session there is a lot more that

1664
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,319
we haven't been able to

1665
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:20,720
cover some of them pretty interesting

1666
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:21,680
for example

1667
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,400
using package step up tools in freecad

1668
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,359
you can

1669
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:28,559
create a kai-cad footprint from

1670
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,319
a step model the other thing we haven't

1671
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:32,880
looked at

1672
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,960
is how to actually build a complete

1673
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,480
enclosure i have just

1674
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,559
got you started by introducing you to

1675
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:40,480
the sketcher workbench

1676
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,000
the part workbench and the part design

1677
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,760
workbench

1678
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,799
what i will do though is that on my

1679
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,640
github repository i will

1680
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,720
besides of course posting all of these

1681
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,960
files that we have been using for

1682
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,520
the four sessions up until now i will

1683
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,920
create an additional folder where i will

1684
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,440
add

1685
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,960
my reference files

1686
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,559
i also not covered another important

1687
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,000
function which is to use what are known

1688
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,319
as

1689
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:15,520
shape binder objects and let me try and

1690
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,039
see if i can very quickly

1691
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:20,160
show you the concept here's a

1692
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,079
circuit board and let's say we're trying

1693
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,720
to now build an enclosure for this so

1694
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,559
we go to part design and

1695
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,440
under task we select on creating a body

1696
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,160
and now within this body i want to use

1697
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:36,559
this

1698
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,920
pcb as a reference object

1699
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,960
for building your enclosure so while our

1700
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,520
body is selected we can click on the

1701
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,640
shape binder tool over here it says

1702
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,039
create new shape binder tool

1703
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,400
click on the advanced select object

1704
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,440
click on the pcb and click

1705
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,559
ok what freecad does is it creates

1706
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,079
a linked object that is a replica of the

1707
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,720
tiny blinky pcb so i can hide tiny

1708
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,599
blinky

1709
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,880
the whole object and this is the shape

1710
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,799
binder

1711
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,920
i can now use all of these edges

1712
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,160
as a reference for creating my enclosure

1713
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,880
so with that i think we can call it a

1714
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,280
wrap

1715
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,319
to this session 4 and this whole series

1716
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:27,119
of classes

1717
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:30,160
of introduction to kai-cad and free cad

1718
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:30,480
at

1719
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,839
