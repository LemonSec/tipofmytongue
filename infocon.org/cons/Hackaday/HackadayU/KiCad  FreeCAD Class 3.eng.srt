00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,439
hi this is anul mahidarya and welcome to

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,440
this third session of introduction to

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,080
kai ked

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:16,640
and freecad at hackaday u

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,439
so last week we completed the track

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,000
routing

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,039
of our pcb and in today's session we'll

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,240
see how to add

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,640
dimensions and measurements to a board

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,800
we'll also figure out how to change the

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,359
origin

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,880
for the grid and the drill

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,800
coordinates we'll take a look at

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,640
interactive routing which is pretty

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,559
useful when you're doing complex

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,200
boards we'll see how we can modify the

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,239
edge cuts layer

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,600
by adding a more complex outline as we

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,480
did in the

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,719
schematic we will figure out how to

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,760
archive the footprints used on the pcb

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,960
we'll add them to the custom library and

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,879
we'll see how we can swap out

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,680
the library references from global

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,879
libraries to the

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,760
project library we look at creating keep

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
out areas which are parts of the circuit

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,200
board where you don't want

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,240
either a copper core or tracks or both

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,640
we'll also look at exposed zones which

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,720
is useful sometimes when you don't want

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,360
mask covering on certain areas of your

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,240
board

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,400
kaikad has had a great explosion of

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,040
plugins being added in recent years and

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,880
some of them are really very handy so

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,640
we'll look at few of them

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,159
once we're through with all of this we

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,920
are practically done with

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,240
all of the circuit board design and we

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,920
will see how to plot

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,640
our layout this requires us to create

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,600
gerber files

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,159
and if you also plan to get your circuit

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,040
board assembled

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,880
then you will need position files for

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,439
all of the surface mount devices

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,759
we will view these gerber files in view

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,799
before we

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,079
package them to send off for fabrication

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,759
we'll also look at how we can produce

52
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,920
pdf files equivalent to all of the

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,600
global layers that we have created

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,159
so we can have a visual examination or

55
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,280
someone who doesn't have

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,759
cad can check out the different layers

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,320
and

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,759
finally we look at how we can export the

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,038
pcb into a cad format in preparation for

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:11,920
next week's

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,800
session on freecad so that's the plan

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
for today and if there's additional time

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
left we'll cover a couple of other

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,200
topics like

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,760
advanced interactive routing or how to

66
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,360
create a footprint from scratch for

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,080
example

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,440
so with that let's get started

69
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,080
all right so let me start off kaican

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,200
this is where we

71
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,920
left off last time with the schematic

72
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,720
and

73
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,920
this is where the circuit board was

74
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,959
last time around to add dimensions

75
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,920
you can use the add dimension toolbar

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,040
icon over here

77
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,280
but you need to choose the layer i

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,360
usually prefer to add it on the

79
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
drawings layer or most often on the

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,959
front fabricate layer and once you click

81
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,480
click on the toolbar icon you get a

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,080
crosshair

83
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
if you hover it over a circular element

84
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,200
like a pad

85
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,480
or an arc you get the alignment target

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,800
same also when you align it over the end

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,239
point of line for example

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,800
so let's click on the center of the

89
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,280
mounting pad here

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,599
and here's the center of the other

91
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,560
mounting pad

92
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,319
and that distance is 1.9

93
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,480
then let's add another dimension from

94
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,840
the center of this pad

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,440
to the edge of this

96
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,879
pcb here that is 0.76 inches

97
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,480
and then the overall width of the pcb

98
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,399
is from this corner

99
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,760
to this corner which is 2.8 inches

100
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
then in the vertical direction the

101
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,200
center of this

102
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,599
mounting hole to the center of this

103
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,400
mounting hole

104
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,760
is 1.34 inches and

105
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,319
the overall width is from this corner

106
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,080
to this one over here that's 1.6 inches

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,840
so dimensions can be useful when you're

108
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
trying to share work with others

109
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,439
or if you want to mark the center point

110
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,439
of certain important elements like

111
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,120
maybe for example the center of the

112
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,480
switch next

113
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,000
you like to change the origin the

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,199
absolute xyz origin is

115
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,840
somewhere at the top left of your canvas

116
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,759
over here

117
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,040
and some board houses require that your

118
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,080
origin starts

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479
at maybe the lower left corner of your

120
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,280
pcb

121
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,160
when you import this pcb into freecad it

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,639
helps

123
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,000
if the the grid origin is at the center

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,080
of the board so there are two different

125
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,000
origin settings that you can do the

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
origin point for the grid

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,520
which is done using this toolbar icon

128
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,840
and then selecting the center of the

129
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,720
board we

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,720
know that the board is 2.8 inches by 1.6

131
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,360
inches

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,479
the center is going to be 1.4

133
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,680
in the x direction by 0.8 in the y

134
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
direction and i click there once

135
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,880
and you'll see a crosshair target that

136
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
comes up over there

137
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,280
and will be used as a center point for

138
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,840
this

139
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,560
pcb when we import it in freecad the

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,160
other thing is to change the

141
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,960
origin of the drill coordinates so that

142
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,840
is done using the

143
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,560
auxiliary axis origin toolbar icon over

144
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:24,960
here

145
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,919
so click on it once and depending on

146
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,720
which

147
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
location you want to choose that point

148
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,120
click once and you'll now notice a red

149
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
crosshair over here so that's the origin

150
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
for the

151
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,520
drill coordinates let's look at

152
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,479
interactive

153
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,680
routing let's turn off the layers that

154
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,880
we don't need

155
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,440
we can hide the fabricated layers we can

156
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,360
add the courtyards

157
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,639
we can hide the silk layers and

158
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,479
we can also probably hide the bottom

159
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,960
layer interactive router

160
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,000
settings are accessed from this

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,639
toolbar icon here and there are three

162
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,319
modes highlight correlations

163
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,440
click on ok click on routing

164
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,720
and if i start a track like so and i try

165
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,120
and

166
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,199
move it around it'll highlight all of

167
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,960
the pads tracks

168
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,080
which it is bumping into

169
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,520
the other one is shout like so

170
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
once you select show and click ok and

171
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
start routing it'll now move

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,319
tracks away from the track that you're

173
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,560
drawing to make space for it

174
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,919
like so and you'll notice the other

175
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,800
tracks

176
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,440
get pushed away as it tries to find the

177
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,919
best

178
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,600
possible path to go from

179
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
one location to the other like so

180
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,319
and the last mode is walk around where

181
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,360
it doesn't

182
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,080
move existing tracks but tries to find

183
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,360
the best possible path

184
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,080
from your location to wherever your

185
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
destination is

186
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,440
by snaking around like so

187
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
so very handy when you're trying to do

188
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,000
complex boards

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,039
our board has a plain rectangular

190
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,639
outline but if you want something

191
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,759
more complex let's select the edge cuts

192
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,319
layer

193
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,319
and if you want to add fillets we can

194
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,520
use the graphic

195
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,639
arc circle icon

196
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,240
and arcs can only be drawn in the

197
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,319
counter clockwise direction so

198
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,960
remember that let's select the center of

199
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,440
this

200
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,560
mounting hole move down until

201
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,520
this edge and then draw a 90 degree arc

202
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,160
like so

203
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,120
so that's one part of our fresh edge

204
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,800
let's add another one that is

205
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,080
0.14 inches away from here like so

206
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,960
start here and end it here like so

207
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,840
then let's add another arc over here

208
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,240
0.14.14 start from here

209
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,800
oops i need to drag it down because it

210
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
has to be in the counterclockwise

211
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,360
direction like so

212
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,080
and end it here and then finally i can

213
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,120
use the

214
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,240
line tool to draw a segment from here

215
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
to here and every time you'll notice the

216
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
crosshair comes up when

217
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,759
it aligns with an element

218
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,720
so here's a modified outline we need to

219
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,320
now reduce the length of this

220
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,399
segment so as i showed you last time i

221
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,080
can select it like so

222
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,760
grab the end point and drag it

223
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,880
until it connects here and do the same

224
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,399
with this segment

225
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,680
select it and drag it and then connect

226
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,000
it to this arc over here

227
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,920
now this is our zone so we have to

228
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,320
regenerate the zone by pressing b

229
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,399
that regenerates the zone and if you

230
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,399
look at the 3d view now this

231
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,200
is what a fresh outline looks like let's

232
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,880
quickly do that for the

233
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
top edge of the board as well let's

234
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,160
select the

235
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,560
arc tool select the center of this

236
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,040
and because i need to move in the

237
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,839
counter clockwise direction i draw an

238
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,000
arc like so

239
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,160
and then another one that's

240
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,199
starts from here

241
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,200
and ends there

242
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,640
and finally a third one

243
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,120
over here

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,399
start off here go in the counter

245
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,320
clockwise direction 90 degrees

246
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
click once and then select the line tool

247
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,320
and draw a segment from the end of this

248
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,000
arc to the start point of this arc

249
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,399
so with that we can now once again let

250
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,680
me hide the bottom

251
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,040
select this segment grab it move it and

252
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,000
drag it down like

253
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,959
so and place it here repeat the same

254
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,000
with this edge

255
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,240
and drag it move it here release it

256
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,360
home press b to regenerate the zone

257
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,959
and if you look at the 3d viewer this

258
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,839
is the modified board edge so that's how

259
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,320
you

260
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,399
can create more complex shapes other

261
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,320
than just rectangular shapes

262
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,360
let's look at an important action which

263
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,440
is archiving the footprints on this

264
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,360
board and creating your own custom

265
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,440
project library for footprints the

266
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,760
process is a little bit similar to

267
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,760
what we used in schematic pcv new offers

268
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,399
a way of

269
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,720
archiving your footprints to an existing

270
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,240
library and

271
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
if you recall from last time we have

272
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,839
created a custom

273
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,880
library of our own where we have

274
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,440
stored the two logos that we have used

275
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,160
in our board

276
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,279
the academy text and the hackaday skull

277
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,079
so besides these two we'd like to dump

278
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:02,959
all of the other

279
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,200
footprints into this library and

280
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,360
thankfully that's pretty easy with pcb

281
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,800
new you click on file

282
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,959
click on archive footprints and select

283
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,399
archive footprints in

284
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,959
existing library it asks you to select a

285
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,079
library so

286
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,279
we choose tiny blinky and say okay

287
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,160
and with that done if we go back to our

288
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,519
library editor

289
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,440
and scroll down to tiny blinky you'll

290
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
notice all of the footprints

291
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,040
are now available here

292
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
so the next thing we would like to do is

293
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,519
we have a library full of the footprints

294
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,560
that we are using

295
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,000
in our board but the actual

296
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
footprints already on the board are

297
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
still referencing the global

298
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,000
library so we would like to change that

299
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,680
like we did in schematic

300
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,800
the best way i figured out to do this is

301
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,000
to go back to eschema this tool called

302
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,279
the cv pcb

303
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,519
which i said is a little bit redundant

304
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,680
but this is one situation where

305
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,800
cv pcb is really useful if i go to cv

306
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,560
cvpcb

307
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,000
things are a little bit easier over here

308
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
what i do is on the left i scroll down

309
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,560
to the tiny blinky library

310
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,720
so all of the parts in that library are

311
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
now visible on the

312
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,000
pane on the right side and what i need

313
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
to do is in the center pane

314
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,680
for each part you will notice that the

315
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,240
library is mentioned followed by the

316
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,839
name of the footprint within that

317
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,680
library so the first component

318
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,200
is from the battery library and the name

319
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,880
of the footprint is battery holder

320
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,959
underscore keystone

321
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,160
underscore 3002 and so on and now our

322
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,920
task is to replace all of these

323
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,720
with the footprints over here on the

324
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,279
right

325
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
so the first one is over here already

326
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
battery holder keystone so that

327
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,079
is the same as this we double click on

328
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,200
this

329
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
then we have a through hole capacitor

330
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,279
which is

331
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,800
radial d8 that is this one

332
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,480
then we have a disc which is this one

333
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,760
then we have three leds so that's this

334
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,079
one

335
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,760
item number five once

336
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,720
thrice the logo skull and the logo

337
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,800
blinky are already from the tiny blinky

338
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,959
library so no need to change that

339
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,200
mounting hole is over here

340
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,000
item six use that

341
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,199
four times d out

342
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,720
is a 1x03 pin socket

343
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,199
which is here spi is

344
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:49,279
2x03 pin header which

345
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,800
is here v in is

346
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,040
pin socket 1x02 that's item 8

347
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,800
5 volt is also pin socket 1x02

348
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,320
item eight so this one

349
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,639
resistor through hole is this one the

350
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,199
actual resistor with the length of 6.3

351
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:09,760
mm

352
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,040
same for the second one the

353
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,160
push button switch is here

354
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,399
the dip eight pin package is here

355
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,399
and finally the ldo is the srt223 which

356
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,519
is here

357
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,959
so with that done we can apply click on

358
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,160
ok

359
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,199
generate the netlist although as i

360
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:33,839
mentioned

361
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,399
it is not necessary but i like to do

362
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,839
this

363
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,920
so then we can go back to pcb new

364
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,120
and let's first inspect this is

365
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,680
the battery holder if i click somewhere

366
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,560
over it and

367
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,519
e for edit to check footprint properties

368
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,279
at the bottom you'll notice library

369
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:53,839
reference

370
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,199
is the library's battery and the

371
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,120
footprint is battery holder keystone

372
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,160
3002

373
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,760
1x2032 let's look at

374
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,160
the programming header e for edit

375
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,639
and this library references connector

376
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,000
underscore pin header underscore

377
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,120
2.54 so all of these parts are coming

378
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,920
from different

379
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,040
global libraries so let's update to this

380
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,760
board now

381
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,360
the update pcb from schematic

382
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,240
or load netlist either of the two can be

383
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,560
run

384
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,680
let me choose the use netlist

385
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,880
click on update pcb yes

386
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,920
close and now if we inspect the

387
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,440
battery footprint hover over it e for

388
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,360
edit you'll notice the library reference

389
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,519
is now tiny blinky

390
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,079
and the footprint is battery holder

391
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,360
keystone 3002

392
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,040
1x 2032 and for the spi

393
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,399
header e4 edit and

394
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,800
same library reference is tiny blinky

395
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,440
and

396
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,120
the footprint is pinheader 2x03

397
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,519
so this is how you archive footprints

398
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,160
put them

399
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,399
into your project specific library and

400
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,680
then replace all of the

401
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,399
footprints on your board with the

402
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,600
footprints from the

403
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,399
project library this make sure that if

404
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,759
there are any changes to global

405
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,639
libraries now

406
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,600
they won't affect the footprints placed

407
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,800
on your circuit board

408
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,839
all right let's look at how to add

409
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,759
keep out areas for example here's the

410
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,040
battery footprint and it is likely that

411
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,440
we

412
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,800
either may not find a surface mount

413
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,519
battery clip for this and might have to

414
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,880
use a through-hole version

415
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,639
in which case it may be necessary to

416
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,240
drill a hole over here for

417
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,720
vn but if you do that it's going to

418
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,600
short out with

419
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,519
the ground plane at the back so we need

420
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,880
to add a keypad

421
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,040
under these pads the way you do it is

422
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,160
select the

423
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,600
bottom layer select the toolbar icon

424
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,839
that says add keep out areas click that

425
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,399
once

426
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,559
and then just draw your

427
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,160
keep out area like so so let's

428
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,199
start from somewhere here

429
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,039
it asks you the layer where you want it

430
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,039
to be and

431
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,039
there are three options to keep out or

432
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,400
include tracks to keep out

433
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,039
include wires or to keep out and or

434
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,439
include ports we don't want

435
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,079
any of these three over here click ok

436
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,720
and then

437
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,120
we can draw

438
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,959
the keep out area like so

439
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,440
once you've done that press b to

440
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
regenerate the

441
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,640
zone and this is how it is the area

442
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,240
under the keep out zone doesn't have the

443
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,360
copper port now

444
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,760
and we can quickly do that on the other

445
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
side as well so

446
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,880
let's start here keep our copper boards

447
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,440
as well

448
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,240
select okay

449
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,880
click here click here

450
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,080
click here and double click here

451
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,039
and then press b to regenerate the zone

452
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:09,600
and

453
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,160
here's another keep out area over here

454
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,600
you'll notice that

455
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,160
there is a track going through this keep

456
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,520
out area over here

457
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,760
and if you run drc

458
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,600
it will warn you that there is a track

459
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,840
inside the keypad area clicking on it

460
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,360
will focus where the error is and

461
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,520
in order to fix this we are going to

462
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,480
hide the zone

463
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,120
by selecting the do not show filled

464
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,600
areas and so on like so

465
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,200
and let me delete this track

466
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,919
and just draw a fresh one that

467
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,679
starts off like so and

468
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,919
ends over here let me make sure this

469
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,320
ground is connected to this track

470
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,000
and while i'm at it let me hide the

471
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,440
bottom and the top silk layers and

472
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,200
fab and courtyard as well

473
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,039
and see if any other ground pins are not

474
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,120
connected let me use the highlight tool

475
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,600
the second one from the top and click on

476
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,880
this ground track

477
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,280
so i can notice that these two pads are

478
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,720
not connected with a track and even

479
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,400
though the zone connects them

480
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,039
as i mentioned last time i prefer to

481
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,400
have physical connections between

482
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,039
all paths before i create a zone so

483
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:29,600
let's

484
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,959
quickly add a track there

485
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,360
let's add a track here that connects

486
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,799
this

487
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,960
let's add tracks that connect these

488
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,600
wires from the

489
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,799
ws to l1 to leds like so

490
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,240
and that's pretty much everything

491
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,400
connected to each other so escape

492
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,880
press b to regenerate the zone once

493
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,679
let's

494
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,160
make the zone visible like so and

495
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,679
here we are we can now run the

496
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,760
drc once again run drc and

497
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,919
the error is now cleared let's close

498
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,360
this and save this

499
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,039
so that's keep out area let's also

500
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,600
figure out how to add another zone for

501
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,960
the output tab or the

502
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,840
center pin of the voltage regulator the

503
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,640
ldo

504
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,520
and to do that let me start by drawing

505
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,880
tracks first

506
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,400
and moving this v in track a bit away

507
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,039
from here

508
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,520
like so so that i can make space for the

509
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,120
zone

510
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,399
so i'm gonna just

511
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,159
make it like so and then delete this

512
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,480
track

513
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,559
all right so i have some space here to

514
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,720
draw copper pore for the

515
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,120
for this five volt tab pin on the led

516
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,919
so if you remember add filled zones lets

517
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:58,640
you

518
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,520
create zones we have selected the top

519
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,320
layer

520
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,240
you need to click somewhere once to get

521
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,799
started like so

522
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,880
it brings up the copper zone properties

523
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,159
dialog box

524
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,360
layer front the net is

525
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,559
5 volt we'd like to do corner

526
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,880
smoothing using fillets with a radius of

527
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,880
20ml zone priority of zero and the other

528
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,919
settings as usual click

529
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,039
ok and we can now start

530
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,400
drawing a zone like so

531
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,039
for example

532
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,840
click here once click here once

533
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,200
click once click here once

534
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,960
and once over here and finally

535
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,039
i will click over here so that creates a

536
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,320
zone for the

537
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,440
five volt hide the bottom

538
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,640
layer now if i already have a zone like

539
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,720
so and i'd like to modify it

540
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,039
i can right click on the corner of a

541
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,480
zone like so

542
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,039
and i can select the create corner

543
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,640
option or you can just also press the

544
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,760
insert key

545
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,039
if i do that i get another anchor point

546
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,520
here

547
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,120
which can be used to change the shape of

548
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,600
the

549
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,440
zone for example so i can

550
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,799
do this if i right click on that point

551
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,840
and use remove corner i can get rid of

552
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,320
it

553
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,559
let's take a look at this in the three

554
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,000
dimensional view

555
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,600
so view 3d viewer and you'll notice that

556
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,720
the zone is covered up with

557
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,559
the solder mask which means the copper

558
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,000
is not exposed

559
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,240
but let's assume that we want to uncover

560
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,799
this zone

561
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,080
to do that you select the mask layer so

562
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,799
in this case

563
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,720
the top mask click on the zone

564
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
icon once click add a start point like

565
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,039
this once

566
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,480
and it will show up a dialog box

567
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,559
with the layer already selected and

568
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,240
there's really not much settings over

569
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,320
you cannot add fillets and chamfers

570
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,000
but you can just click ok and let's

571
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,600
draw an outline that matches the copper

572
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,919
zone on the top layer like so

573
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,280
and finally double click here and

574
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,720
what i have here is a mask which

575
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,919
makes sure that the underlying copper is

576
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,880
now exposed if we look at the 3d view

577
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,760
now

578
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,799
you'll see that this is an exposed

579
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,440
zone now so you can add some additional

580
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,200
let's say solder over here if this is

581
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
going to be a high current track for

582
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,240
example or if you're trying to do an

583
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,760
artistic board where you have certain

584
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,720
areas where

585
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,840
you want to expose the copper next let's

586
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,640
look at

587
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,559
plugins plugins are accessed by doing

588
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,240
tools external plugins

589
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,400
most of the plugins are available from

590
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,240
github repositories

591
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,520
and you need to install them in a

592
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,960
specific location on your computer

593
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
in order to find out where you have to

594
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,960
do it you can start off the

595
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,000
scripting console like so this brings up

596
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,480
the

597
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,200
python console let me make sure the text

598
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,840
is

599
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,880
legible like so and

600
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,559
you can run a couple of commands to

601
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,000
figure out where the path is

602
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,120
where plugins need to be saved so we

603
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,960
start by

604
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,279
importing pcb new

605
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,120
and then let's print

606
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,559
for pcb new the

607
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,880
plugin directory search

608
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,000
and press enter so here is a list of all

609
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,720
of the

610
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,279
acceptable folders where i can keep

611
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,080
plugins

612
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,600
i prefer putting it in the dot tricad

613
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,720
underscore plugins

614
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,559
directory so once you copy and put a

615
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,880
plugin folder within one of these

616
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,600
folders

617
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,400
you can then start kaicah go to tools

618
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,039
external plugins and do refresh plugins

619
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,000
and it should appear over here if you'd

620
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,720
like to see

621
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,760
an icon for the tools you can

622
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,799
go to preferences preferences

623
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,080
and under pcb new

624
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,360
action plugins you can check the box

625
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,159
that says

626
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,279
show a button click ok

627
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,400
let's check out some of the plugins that

628
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:40,880
i

629
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,919
tend to use just go them in sequential

630
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,440
order that they appear over here tear

631
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,279
drops tear drops are handy and useful

632
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,760
if you're doing flexible circuit boards

633
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,640
because

634
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,360
it creates a necking area between the

635
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:53,840
track

636
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,880
and the pad so it adds

637
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,840
something like this i prefer 50 for

638
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,880
horizontal

639
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,919
click on set teardrops say okay and it

640
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,279
says it's added 53 teardrops so say okay

641
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,200
and here let me hide the bottom copper

642
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,400
and the bottom silk

643
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,440
and here's the teardrop added to this

644
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,080
pad

645
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,919
you'll notice it doesn't add teardrops

646
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,240
to every pad because if it doesn't find

647
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
enough space to add one it just ignores

648
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,039
that pad

649
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,240
this has been added as a zone over here

650
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,520
and if i click e for editing this zone

651
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
you'll notice that zone priority level

652
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,760
is 100 and this is how the teardrops

653
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,279
plug-in keeps a track of

654
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,039
where the teardrops are so if i want to

655
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:41,679
go back

656
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,320
and delete all of these teardrops i go

657
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,039
to

658
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,960
plugins teardrops and

659
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,840
if i select remove all teardrops it'll

660
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,440
remove the teardrops because

661
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,120
they are all have a zone priority of 100

662
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,240
so let me do that remove teardrops it's

663
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,880
remote

664
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,679
53 teardrops and they're gone now

665
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,640
rounder for tracks creates fillets on

666
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,159
tracks you have to start off by

667
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,000
selecting two tracks first so

668
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,720
let me choose this click here once shift

669
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,600
and click

670
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,720
here to choose these two segments

671
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,039
then i can go to tools rounder for

672
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:21,760
tracks

673
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,559
brings up a dialog box where i can set

674
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:24,880
the

675
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,960
distance from the intersection maybe 1

676
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,279
mm choose the number of segments

677
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,559
and click round so

678
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,080
there it adds a nice fillet over here

679
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,320
and if you like to delete it

680
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,600
you need to select

681
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,919
it like so using the block select then

682
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:46,880
go to tools

683
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,399
external plugins rounder for tracks

684
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,600
and select the

685
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,840
delete option so that gets rid of the

686
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
segments but then you'll have to use the

687
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,880
track option to connect this back

688
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,240
like so next plugin i have

689
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,279
is mask expander again i need to select

690
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,559
a track for this to happen let me select

691
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,520
this track

692
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,559
like so and if i go to tools

693
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,000
plugins and scroll to mask expander i

694
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,840
can set a value

695
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,039
and click ok and what it does

696
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,760
is it makes sure that the solder mask is

697
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,159
removed from this portion of the track

698
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,440
so if we look at the 3d view you can

699
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,080
see the result of this which is over

700
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,360
here you can see this

701
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,039
part of the track has been uncovered now

702
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,919
so that's solder mask expander let me

703
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:44,399
delete

704
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,320
that as well and let's look at

705
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,000
measure length for selected tracks this

706
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,440
is handy when you're trying to do

707
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,200
length tuning if you want to know the

708
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,279
length of an existing track

709
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,520
and then you want to set a new length

710
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,640
for it then you

711
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,960
start off by using this tool click once

712
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,679
i select

713
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,279
the segment if i click on you i select

714
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,360
that particular track

715
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,840
and if if i press i i select the whole

716
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,760
net so that's how you select different

717
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,480
sections of copper tracks so if you want

718
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
to measure this the length of this

719
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,679
segment click on advanced tools external

720
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:22,320
plug-ins

721
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,000
measure length it's five 3.556 mm

722
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,080
at zero degrees if i click on it once

723
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,360
and u to include that track then

724
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,320
go back to tools plugins measure length

725
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,000
and the length of this track is nine

726
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,120
point five

727
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,799
and if i again go back here click once

728
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,399
i for the whole net and tools

729
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,840
plugins measure length will show me the

730
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
overall length for the whole

731
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,880
net generator adds

732
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,120
a series of wires surrounding a track

733
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,480
let me

734
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,559
try and show this here select this track

735
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,240
once go to tools

736
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,039
external plugins wirefence generator

737
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,880
that brings up a dialog box here you can

738
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,320
make some settings

739
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,200
choose which net i like to uncheck this

740
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,720
because otherwise it doesn't really

741
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,320
place wires everywhere

742
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,200
and once you click ok you'll notice that

743
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,000
after a while

744
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,960
it adds up wires but it also wants you

745
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,159
to run a drc

746
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,480
because placing these wires might now be

747
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,520
violating some

748
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,640
drc rules so let's click ok and we know

749
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,760
certain

750
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,240
problems already for example this wire

751
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,760
is too close to the track so let's

752
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,399
delete that

753
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,600
same with this let's delete that and

754
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,039
these two wires because they've been

755
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,559
placed over here on this track have

756
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,520
become 5v

757
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,559
so let's get rid of those two wires

758
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,399
and here we have a series of

759
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,520
wires surrounding this particular track

760
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,640
so that's how fencing works let me

761
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,240
undo all of this go back to home

762
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,760
and let's look at the next plugin

763
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,600
let's look at wire stitching generator

764
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,760
this is different from wire fencing

765
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,399
because what stitching does is sprinkles

766
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:08,960
wires

767
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,279
all over your board so if you want to

768
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,399
connect

769
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,720
a ground plane all over your board you

770
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,440
just select

771
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,760
wire stitching generator for the whole

772
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,480
board

773
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,440
like so set up a few parameters and then

774
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:21,919
click

775
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,600
run after a while it should add wires

776
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,919
all the way about like so

777
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,120
let me get rid of that too

778
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,600
the last one is really a pretty awesome

779
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,240
piece of

780
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,320
code it's the interactive bill of

781
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,000
materials generator

782
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,559
and once you click on it it brings up a

783
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,240
dialog box where you make certain

784
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
initial settings there are three tabs

785
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,760
general html and extra in general you

786
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,320
set the

787
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,279
location you give a name format you can

788
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,960
include track zones and

789
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,919
nets it makes for a more pleasing visual

790
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,120
experience if you do that

791
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
you can sort components in a particular

792
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,960
order you can blacklist certain

793
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,919
components

794
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,360
and so on click on interactive html bom

795
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,039
and say generate bom and it should open

796
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:09,519
up

797
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,640
in my browser like so

798
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,559
and there are lots of visual settings

799
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,480
over here you can look at just the front

800
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,679
side of the board

801
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,000
you can look at front and back both or

802
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,279
you can just look at the back for

803
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,399
example

804
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,799
you can choose a different layout like

805
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,039
so

806
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,760
you can have ungrouped and group bombs

807
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,840
this one shows just a net list so if you

808
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,640
click on one

809
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,840
it will show you where that net is going

810
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,000
like so so let's look at uh

811
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,320
ungroup bomb for example and then this

812
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,720
is a handy table that shows you how many

813
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,960
components on your board and how many

814
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,080
pads and so on

815
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,720
and you can also export this as images

816
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,000
if you want them to

817
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,399
and there are two handy columns over

818
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,760
here in the

819
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,320
bomb list one is called source the other

820
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,440
is called placed

821
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,600
so if you are working on a code and you

822
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,880
placed orders

823
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,919
and parts are on the way then you can

824
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,000
check mark these fields the other column

825
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
is placed as you keep assembling this

826
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,320
board if you already placed a component

827
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,919
you can check mark it

828
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,279
like so and that row gets grayed out

829
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,279
so really handy tool it's not just a

830
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,960
bill of materials but also a great

831
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,320
assembly tool when you're

832
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,960
creating your own handmade circuit

833
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,840
boards

834
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,720
so let's minimize this and go back to

835
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,640
our board

836
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,679
and now we're ready to plot the

837
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,399
final production files that we can send

838
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,440
to

839
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,840
fab house for getting our circuit boards

840
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,559
made

841
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,360
the way plotting works is click on file

842
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,640
click on plot

843
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,120
brings up a dialog box and there are

844
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
some important settings here so i'll try

845
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,440
and

846
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,039
walk you through all of them first of

847
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,039
all you choose a drop down and

848
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,240
choose the format you want i prefer to

849
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,480
first create pdfs check them out and

850
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,480
then create the final girls for the

851
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,519
output directory

852
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,399
i prefer to put the pdfs in a separate

853
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,080
folder so i open my

854
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,800
project folder create a new folder here

855
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,199
called

856
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,119
pdf and

857
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,440
ask it to use that as a relative path

858
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,960
like so

859
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,800
selecting the layers that i need to to

860
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,079
plot the pdfs for

861
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,918
i definitely want the front and back

862
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,719
copper and the front and back silk

863
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,560
i don't need the edge cuts but yeah i

864
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,079
would like to have the

865
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,320
front fabricate layer i'd also like to

866
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,480
plot the border and title wire so the

867
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,480
whole page is printed

868
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,480
i like to plot footprint values and

869
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,760
references i

870
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,480
like to include pcb edge layer from

871
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,440
other layers so

872
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,079
remove this check mark like to include

873
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,000
pads from silk screen so remove this

874
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,800
check mark

875
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,199
check zone fills before plotting for

876
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,000
drill marks

877
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,359
use actual size and then

878
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,680
select plot if i go to my project folder

879
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,520
tiny blinky here's the pdf folder

880
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,839
and here are the layers that it has

881
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:04,720
created the

882
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,079
front and back copper and silk and the

883
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,440
front fabricate layer the one more pdf

884
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,680
file that i like to create is located

885
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,760
under generate drill files

886
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,280
so click on that once and

887
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,560
here's a button that says generate the

888
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,280
map file

889
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,800
what this does is create a map of the

890
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,040
different drill sizes that will be

891
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,000
needed for your

892
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,040
board default settings are okay for this

893
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,359
just click on generate the map file and

894
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,160
close it

895
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,560
and if i go back to my project directory

896
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,200
there will be

897
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,280
a new file here called drill map if you

898
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,320
open it up

899
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,400
you are presented with a list of all of

900
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,320
the drills that will be needed for your

901
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,800
board

902
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,440
and a legend that indicates where each

903
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,079
of those

904
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,680
drills will be placed so this is

905
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,160
also kind of handy and useful to check

906
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,359
before you

907
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,480
send out your file for production

908
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,640
so let me close this let me minimize

909
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,720
this and now we can make the

910
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,160
goldberg so first select the plot format

911
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,520
gerber output directory let me

912
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,000
go to tiny blinky and create a new

913
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,720
folder here

914
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,040
called gerber created

915
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,960
and open that path say yes to relative

916
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,599
path

917
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,920
the layers we need is certainly front

918
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,880
and back copper

919
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,599
front and back silk front and back mask

920
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,480
you need these

921
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,839
six layers you need the edge cuts

922
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,000
and that's it you don't need fabricate

923
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,680
or courtyard layers for

924
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,520
making a pcb we don't want the

925
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,480
border and title bio now we need to

926
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:44,960
print

927
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,079
values and references we don't want to

928
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,920
force plotting of invisible

929
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,520
text we want to exclude pcb layer from

930
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,480
other layers that's important

931
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,680
you need to subtract

932
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,920
solder masks from silk screen this is

933
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,520
important to make sure that if you have

934
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,320
any text

935
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,839
or graphical elements that are covering

936
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:08,160
or

937
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,200
are on top of solder pads they will be

938
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,920
removed

939
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,599
in the plot and finally this is where

940
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,240
the

941
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,640
auxiliary axis as origin is useful if

942
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,320
you set an auxiliary axis

943
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
as origin and you want to use it make

944
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,599
sure you use this

945
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,240
check mark otherwise leave it at as it

946
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,880
is

947
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,920
check zones before filling the

948
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,200
other check boxes as usual are

949
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,680
okay with the standard settings at this

950
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,760
point we can say

951
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,960
plot so that plots all of these

952
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,079
layers as gerber files but we also need

953
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,839
to generate the drill file so

954
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,960
click on the generate drill files button

955
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,079
and make sure that you have selected

956
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,400
excellent format with pth and non-pth

957
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,760
pads club as a single file

958
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,240
for drill origin if you have chosen

959
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
auxiliary in the previous menu then make

960
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,160
sure you choose auxiliary here as well

961
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,560
otherwise leave it at absolute

962
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,440
your drill units in mmo inches zeros

963
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,960
format

964
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,920
and that's about it i think most of the

965
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,640
standard settings are good so just

966
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,440
select generate drill file that creates

967
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,000
a dot

968
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,119
drl file close this close this

969
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,960
and let's just save this so at this

970
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,040
point we have generated the

971
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,480
gerbers and we have generated the

972
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,599
the drill file and the pdf files

973
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,520
the one additional file that may be

974
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,720
needed in case you

975
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,200
want to get your circuit board assembled

976
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,599
then you have to create a position file

977
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,000
and you do that by selecting file

978
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,520
fabrication outputs

979
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,079
and selecting the footprint position

980
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,040
file or the dot pos file so select that

981
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,160
select the directory put it there ascii

982
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,440
format works

983
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,560
millimeter units and depending on the

984
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,640
board house if they want a single file

985
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:02,960
for

986
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,520
parts on front and back or separate

987
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,359
files for front and back

988
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,640
and then we can let's select a single

989
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,520
board file

990
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,920
and then generate the position file and

991
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,800
close this

992
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,599
so that creates the position file let's

993
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,400
look at it

994
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,079
it's in the folder gerber

995
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,960
there are there is one position file

996
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,000
it's

997
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
a text file and certain board houses

998
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,480
want

999
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,839
this formatted with certain headers over

1000
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:34,640
here

1001
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,760
so you might have to modify this file to

1002
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,359
meet the requirements of the board

1003
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,079
housing

1004
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,200
so that's your position file so

1005
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,680
at this point we are done with uh all of

1006
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,880
the plotting let's

1007
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,839
make sure that the files generated are

1008
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:50,960
as they should be

1009
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,200
by verifying them in group view so you

1010
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,079
go to the

1011
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,440
kicad project manager and click on this

1012
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,240
icon which says gerber viewer that opens

1013
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,880
up

1014
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,040
view like so and now you need to import

1015
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,960
all the gerber files that you've created

1016
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,400
file open gerber files choose the

1017
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,359
directory

1018
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,560
choose all of the kerber files

1019
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,160
but not the job file open

1020
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,720
so that's all of the layers here the

1021
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,240
next thing you want to do is

1022
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,960
file import the drill file that's this

1023
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,000
one

1024
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,280
click on that that opens up the drill

1025
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,560
file now let me

1026
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,839
hide the some of the layers here's the

1027
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,760
bottom mask front mask bottom and front

1028
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,640
silk and bottom and front copper so what

1029
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,440
you see now

1030
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,720
is the edge cut layer and the

1031
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,240
drills and then i can enable the

1032
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,240
the front copper on top of the front

1033
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,119
copper layer

1034
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,520
this is going to be the front mask and

1035
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,359
then finally on top of that will be the

1036
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,160
silk layer

1037
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,200
like so all right so let's hide the

1038
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,440
front layers and look at the bottom

1039
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,560
layers here's the

1040
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,240
bottom copper here's the bottom mask

1041
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,280
and finally here's the bottom

1042
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,920
silk which is here let's rename with all

1043
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,880
of the layers

1044
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,560
and once things look golden we can

1045
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,720
close this we can go to the gerber

1046
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,920
folder and select drill

1047
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,680
a bottom copper bottom mask bottom silk

1048
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,800
edge cuts front copper front mask front

1049
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,440
stick

1050
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,359
and create a compressed archive

1051
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,880
like so okay now that we have created

1052
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,920
the global files

1053
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,079
maybe it's a good idea to check out if

1054
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,079
we can actually submit it to a border

1055
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:44,560
house

1056
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,280
and get them fabricated let me open up

1057
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,560
my browser

1058
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,119
and get a new tab and we can try

1059
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,240
submitting it to

1060
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,800
for example osh park they have a nice

1061
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,960
online viewer that lets you

1062
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,440
check your submission before you

1063
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,319
actually

1064
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,280
approve it so let's click on browse for

1065
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:03,920
files

1066
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,280
you can either submit your dot kaikai

1067
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,319
pcb file

1068
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,599
directly or you can submit the zip

1069
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,440
archive that contains all of the google

1070
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,400
files let's

1071
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,599
take the zip archive click open wait for

1072
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,440
aushpark to upload and process our

1073
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,760
design

1074
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,720
and here it is we have the top layer and

1075
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,760
the bottom layer

1076
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,480
and if we continue this we can order it

1077
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,560
out and have it delivered to us in a few

1078
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:30,960
days

1079
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,440
let's minimize this and get back to our

1080
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,880
project

1081
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,040
the next thing we'd like to do is export

1082
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,480
our circuit board

1083
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,680
into a cad format and kaicad offers

1084
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,160
two different options to export your cad

1085
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,599
model you can

1086
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,760
do either vrml or you can do step

1087
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,160
vrml looks pretty because it includes

1088
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,440
the copper layer

1089
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,640
and the cell clears as well the step

1090
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,800
export includes just the bare board and

1091
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,760
just the parts

1092
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,720
but step is more useful in a cad

1093
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,359
environment

1094
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,119
the other thing to remember before

1095
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,800
exporting is

1096
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,240
to recall that we placed the

1097
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,079
grid origin offset at the center of the

1098
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,839
board like so which

1099
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,200
as we noted was at an x y coordinate of

1100
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,680
3

1101
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,480
inches by 2 inches we will use this as

1102
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:22,800
the

1103
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,760
origin for the export of the vrml and

1104
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,000
the

1105
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,040
step files so with that let's

1106
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,040
go to export click on vrml

1107
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,079
provide a destination and if you check

1108
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,480
this option that says copy 3d model

1109
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,079
files to the 3d model

1110
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,200
path then kaicad will include a sub

1111
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,680
folder called shapes 3d which contains

1112
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,400
the different

1113
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,599
3d models for all of your footprints

1114
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,880
that results in a smaller vrml file

1115
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,480
i prefer including and bundling

1116
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,880
everything into one vrml file so

1117
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,240
i usually don't use this check mark

1118
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,920
the other thing to do is provide the

1119
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,000
grid reference point which as you saw is

1120
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,920
x3 and y2

1121
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,880
output units in mm is okay and once you

1122
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,920
click ok

1123
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,839
your vrml file is generated

1124
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,440
next let's export the step format

1125
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,480
once again provide a output path

1126
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,440
choose user defined origin and set that

1127
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:23,760
as

1128
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,280
x equals three and y equals two and

1129
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,599
you can click on export takes a while

1130
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,359
and if there are no errors then you have

1131
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,040
successfully exported your

1132
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,920
step file so having done this let's

1133
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,200
check it out and see if

1134
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,319
those export have been successful here's

1135
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,359
the step file

1136
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,040
and here's the wrl vrml file so let's

1137
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,880
open each one and check it out in

1138
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,720
freecad right click

1139
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,839
open with freecad

1140
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,200
okay so here's freecad let me zoom out

1141
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,400
get an isometric view and this is your

1142
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,680
circuit board in vrml format you can

1143
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,079
see the tracks you can see the self

1144
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,040
legend

1145
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,839
but this is a single object you cannot

1146
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,680
manipulate any of the footprints

1147
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,880
individually

1148
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,000
so let's hide this board by selecting it

1149
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,920
and pressing the spacebar key that's how

1150
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,720
you hide and unhide objects in freecad

1151
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,800
and let's import the step file and check

1152
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,839
that out as well

1153
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,119
file import step open

1154
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,280
and here's your step file and as you can

1155
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,880
see it doesn't have the tracks

1156
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,440
it doesn't have the self legend but you

1157
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,079
can expand the model tree like so

1158
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,440
and look at each individual footprint

1159
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,560
by selecting it i can select the

1160
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,720
radial capacitor and if i press spacebar

1161
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,800
key i can hide it if i press spacebar

1162
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,480
again i can unhide it

1163
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,520
here's the disk capacitor

1164
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,800
here's the led and so on

1165
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,680
the third thing you can do is file

1166
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,480
import

1167
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,760
and get the kicad pcb

1168
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,319
file directly without having done any

1169
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,440
export from

1170
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,640
kaicad so freecad is able to natively

1171
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,119
open

1172
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,480
kaicad pcb files

1173
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,520
takes a while for it to import all of

1174
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,200
the footprints

1175
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,480
once you say okay this is pretty much

1176
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,160
similar to the step file

1177
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,520
you can expand the model tree and

1178
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,040
you can expand the models to

1179
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,119
check out each individual footprint

1180
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,560
and component like so all right so

1181
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,440
let's close this and get back to our

1182
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,520

1183
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,079
okay with that done let's see if we can

1184
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:44,880
make a

1185
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,160
custom footprint the battery footprint

1186
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,319
that we have selected as you remember is

1187
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,440
just a standard

1188
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,720
2032 coin cell battery holder for a

1189
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,599
single cell

1190
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,520
but in this case we want to use two

1191
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,280
batteries so

1192
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,960
let's start off by first searching for

1193
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,480
online and

1194
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,520
i prefer digikey usually i know that a

1195
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,720
keystone has a

1196
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,119
big selection of battery holders and

1197
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,079
retainers so

1198
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,319
let me just look for keystone battery

1199
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,480
okay so under battery products

1200
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,800
and the holders we have about 800 items

1201
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,240
so let's see if we can

1202
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,240
narrow that down we can use the filters

1203
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,599
we're looking for two cells and

1204
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,520
for the 2032 series so scroll down here

1205
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,559
yes 2032 that gives us seven

1206
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,079
options we can apply this filter and

1207
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,599
let's see what we have all right so

1208
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:47,200
3025-2 is through-hole

1209
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,559
and 30-24-2 is surface mount

1210
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,599
so let's open each one in a separate tab

1211
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,880
like so so here's uh 3025-2

1212
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,520
let's get the drawing to start with so

1213
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,359
here's the data sheet drawing

1214
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:09,680
let's save it in our

1215
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,440
datasheets folder like so

1216
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,440
let's check out the 3024 as well

1217
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,200
get the drawing and

1218
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,760
save that as well we'll also need the

1219
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,520
[Music]

1220
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,040
3d step file let's look at documents and

1221
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,200
media on digi-key

1222
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,319
but i can't see 3d

1223
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,520
or cad model over here if i can't find

1224
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,319
it like so

1225
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,240
i usually start off with the

1226
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,160
manufacturer so let's look at

1227
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,920
keystone electronics

1228
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,599
3024-2

1229
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,559
yes it is keystone electronics 3024-2

1230
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,240
so let's click on step to download the

1231
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,040
step file please enter your mail address

1232
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,520
all right i guess we have to do this so

1233
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,319
provide the

1234
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,119
email address submit it check your email

1235
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,240
for the code

1236
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,960
all right so here's my email okay here

1237
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,359
it is

1238
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,599
copy the code and paste it here

1239
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,400
enter code hopefully i can get the step

1240
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,119
file now

1241
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,599
click to download okay here's the step

1242
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,640
file so

1243
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,920
we can add it in the freecad folder i

1244
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,640
guess

1245
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,839
save step five good

1246
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,599
so we have the data sheet and we have

1247
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,440
the step file so we can close all of

1248
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,160
this now

1249
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,080
so let's open up the

1250
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,599
[Music]

1251
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,240
drawing that we downloaded data sheets

1252
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,880
30

1253
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,559
24-2 that's the surface mount

1254
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,800
retainer and here's the information that

1255
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,920
we need

1256
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,040
so there are two square pads of 0.2

1257
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,160
inches and the center pad they

1258
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,880
mention a minimum square size but

1259
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,040
usually it's preferred to add a round

1260
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,359
pad over here of a sufficiently large

1261
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:06,400
diameter

1262
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,960
and the other important dimension is the

1263
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,480
spacing between these

1264
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,839
two square pads so with this let's

1265
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,119
go back to okay let's open up our

1266
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,720
footprint editor like so

1267
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,480
we can scroll down to tiny blinky

1268
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,880
and maybe it'll be easier to start with

1269
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,319
the existing holder and just

1270
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,319
modify it rather than do everything from

1271
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,520
scratch so let's

1272
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,760
select this footprint and save it as

1273
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,880
a different name three zero

1274
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,839
two four

1275
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,000
save it so we have this footprint over

1276
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,720
here

1277
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,240
let me unhide the pads like so

1278
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,720
okay so these two square pads are 0.2

1279
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,240
inches square so let's

1280
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,720
check that out double click on the pad

1281
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,920
it's

1282
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,359
200.7874 mils

1283
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,640
and the other one is the same size as

1284
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:04,960
well

1285
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,359
okay so these pads are the right size

1286
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,400
now let's look at

1287
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,440
the spacing between the two pads it

1288
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,559
needs to be 1.339 but that's from

1289
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,559
one edge to the other edge we need to

1290
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,040
have the center to center distance so

1291
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,680
let me get the calculator and what we're

1292
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,079
looking

1293
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,440
for is 1.339

1294
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,960
less 0.2 and half of that

1295
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,040
is a distance from the origin to the

1296
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,720
center of one of the paths so

1297
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,280
let me copy this so i can just paste it

1298
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,240
directly in

1299
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,920
the footprint editor go back to

1300
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,160
footprint editor double click on this

1301
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:40,720
pad

1302
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,720
and position x instead of 0.50

1303
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,839
needs to be 0.5695 select

1304
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,520
okay do the same for the other one

1305
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,720
the previous one was a negative value

1306
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,319
this one is a positive value

1307
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,119
select okay so that's our pads i guess

1308
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:01,680
it's

1309
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,440
better to reduce the diameter of the

1310
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,520
center one so double click on that

1311
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,400
it's somewhere around 700 mils let's

1312
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,520
make it

1313
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,280
600 there that's nice

1314
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,599
and now finally what we need to do is

1315
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,839
move these uh

1316
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:21,280
silk legend and fabricate layer segments

1317
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,920
so that they don't go over the pad like

1318
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,400
so

1319
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,599
let me get the pads in

1320
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,839
outline mode like so and we can now

1321
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,079
select

1322
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:37,200
this graphic line press m to move it

1323
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,000
and place it here we can then grab this

1324
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,599
segment drag the endpoint

1325
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,680
and place it here i can

1326
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,400
grab this end point or this segment and

1327
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,559
place it here so that's

1328
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,599
done and

1329
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,960
this segment on the silk layer once

1330
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,440
again

1331
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,960
m to move it like so

1332
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,200
select this segment and drag it

1333
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,319
select this segment and

1334
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,400
drag it and finally

1335
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,200
this one selected m for move right here

1336
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,720
select this segment and drag it

1337
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,079
select this segment

1338
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,280
click and drag and leave it so that's

1339
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,559
one side done let's repeat it on the

1340
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,920
other side

1341
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,599
extend it press home let's

1342
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,200
fill up the pads and let's

1343
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,040
save this so we have a footprint

1344
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,920
in which the pads are as per the data

1345
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,400
sheet

1346
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,520
the outline may not be but we will see

1347
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,400
how to do that

1348
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,240
in the next session when we use free cad

1349
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,559
because from this drawing it's not

1350
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,079
really easy to draw

1351
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,119
an outline for a footprint because a lot

1352
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,400
of dimensions are

1353
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,200
missing so not much use we'll have to

1354
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,040
use the step file that we've

1355
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,599
downloaded and from there we can

1356
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,520
probably make our footprint better

1357
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,079
let me close this this one is saved so i

1358
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,359
can close this

1359
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,319
i can now replace this footprint with

1360
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,040
the

1361
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,359
new one that we created so i can click

1362
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,440
on this e for edit

1363
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,960
and here's the change footprint button

1364
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,839
select that the existing footprint is

1365
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,599
keystone 3002

1366
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,799
the new footprint identifier i open and

1367
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,079
i select

1368
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,680
this one click apply click close

1369
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,319
and here's your new footprint now

1370
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:47,760
because the pads have

1371
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,160
moved away from the earlier footprint

1372
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,599
it's best to

1373
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,160
delete a couple of these segments and

1374
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,119
redraw the

1375
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,880
tracks so that they connect to the

1376
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,319
anchor point of the pad

1377
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,799
so hover my mouse over this segment and

1378
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,160
press backspace

1379
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,960
and hold my mouse over here press

1380
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,079
backspace and this

1381
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,440
one i can delete

1382
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,480
okay then let's select the route tracks

1383
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,200
option

1384
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,919
start here

1385
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:21,119
and place a track like so

1386
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,480
start from here place it like so

1387
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,040
let's just regenerate the zone

1388
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,319
now once we have changed the footprint

1389
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:32,960
on the

1390
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,000
pcb like so we are left in a situation

1391
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,480
where the schematic is reporting a

1392
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,480
different footprint from what is

1393
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,200
actually used in the pcb and this is

1394
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,680
where

1395
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,799
back import helps just to show you if i

1396
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:47,599
go back to

1397
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,960
schematic and here in the power supply

1398
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,240
sheet if i double click

1399
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,960
on the battery you'll notice that the

1400
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,680
footprint

1401
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,240
is still being shown as the earlier one

1402
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,119
that we have

1403
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,920
already replaced in pcb new so i can now

1404
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,720
cancel this

1405
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,280
go back to pcb and this is where back

1406
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,400
import helps

1407
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,079
we do that by clicking on file export

1408
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,160
and creating what's known as a footprint

1409
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,520
association file

1410
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,640
click on that click save and that's

1411
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,359
done the next step is to go back to

1412
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:20,559
eschema

1413
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,440
and now use this option which says back

1414
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,359
import symbol footprint association

1415
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:26,400
click on it once

1416
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,640
select the file that was created in pc

1417
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,799
menu open it click ok

1418
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,520
and we are done if we now look at the

1419
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,480
battery symbol

1420
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,319
you'll notice that the footprint is now

1421
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,720
updated to reflect the changes made

1422
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,599
in pcb new so this is how you push back

1423
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,640
changes from

1424
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,720
pcb and import them into eschema

1425
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,200
we can just quickly make sure that we

1426
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,520
make everything up to date by creating a

1427
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,240
netlist

1428
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,799
saving it and i can now leave this sheet

1429
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:55,760
and save

1430
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,359
e-schema and make sure that i also save

1431
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,400
my pcb let's run a quick

1432
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,359
drc on it to make sure that there is no

1433
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:05,920
errors

1434
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,920
run drc looks good close it

1435
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,040
let's check out the 3d view so view

1436
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,599
3d viewer and here's what our board

1437
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,559
looks like

1438
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,280
and we're still missing the 3d model for

1439
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:19,839
the

1440
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,720
battery clip now we downloaded a step

1441
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,240
file so let's see if

1442
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,599
we can use that here i click on this

1443
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,799
footprint e4 edit and

1444
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,000
here's 3d settings i can delete whatever

1445
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,799
is there

1446
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,920
click on open folder navigate to

1447
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,960
where my step file was downloaded which

1448
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,480
was

1449
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,960
in this

1450
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,839
folder under freecad here it is

1451
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,960
oops and seems to be a problem with

1452
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,400
the model because

1453
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,480
the battery clip consists of two parts

1454
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,920
the metal retainer

1455
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,480
and a plastic insulator and

1456
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,839
unfortunately the drawing we have

1457
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:04,960
received from

1458
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,000
keystone shows them separated out in

1459
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,640
space

1460
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,960
so we will not be able to use this

1461
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,559
directly in kai-ked but

1462
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,880
anyway let's just try and place it so we

1463
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,599
get a rough

1464
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,400
idea of how things look like click on ok

1465
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,559
even the orientation isn't as it

1466
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,680
should be and although kaicad offers

1467
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,799
a way to scale rotate and offset

1468
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:30,400
this 3d model it is best to do this

1469
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,480
in freecad so that we don't have to

1470
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,440
fiddle around here

1471
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,440
but for the moment let me see if we can

1472
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,440
just approximately place it so

1473
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,040
i guess it needs to be rotated in the

1474
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,000
x direction 90 oh that's the other way

1475
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,040
around so maybe

1476
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,960
minus 90 yeah so that's the right side

1477
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,280
up

1478
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,480
but now i have to offset it in the

1479
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,839
z direction so let me see

1480
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,280
point one two three four is too much

1481
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,119
four is two less so 45

1482
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,799
45 is about right let's look at the

1483
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:10,480
top view and it needs some

1484
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,839
offset in the x and y directions as well

1485
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:14,240
so

1486
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,640
let's try x first let me zoom in and i

1487
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,520
think it's

1488
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,480
pretty much in the ballpark area where

1489
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,520
it should be

1490
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,280
in the x direction let's try y

1491
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,200
about the same again needs to be

1492
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,319
negative

1493
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:33,920
minus 0.04 all right so we have it

1494
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,520
roughly where it should be but the

1495
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,599
insulator is still hanging in space

1496
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,880
let's just click ok here save this

1497
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,839
and try and view this in 3d viewer here

1498
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:45,440
it is

1499
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,920
all right so we have the the metal

1500
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,359
retainer where it should be

1501
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:53,200
but not the insulator let's save things

1502
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,960
all right so with that we have pretty

1503
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,799
much gone through every

1504
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,680
feature and as i mentioned earlier there

1505
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,319
are a few

1506
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,480
advanced interactive router settings

1507
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,240
that we haven't seen so let's see if we

1508
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:04,880
can

1509
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,960
check those out very quickly if you go

1510
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,319
to route and

1511
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,400
look at the different options available

1512
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,680
you'll see that you can

1513
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,520
draw of course single track as we have

1514
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,440
been drawing up until now but you can

1515
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,280
also draw differential pairs

1516
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,599
in certain cases you want to have

1517
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,599
different tracks have the same

1518
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,000
length so you can tune different tracks

1519
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,680
to have the same length using the tune

1520
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,200
track option

1521
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,400
if you have a bunch of differential

1522
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,240
pairs and you want all of them to be the

1523
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,359
same length then

1524
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,119
you can use the tuned differential pair

1525
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:37,520
length option and then you can fine tune

1526
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,079
the

1527
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,000
length of the differential pairs using

1528
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,359
skew and phase so let's

1529
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:44,400
look at these options quickly in order

1530
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,920
to show you that we'll have to go back

1531
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,400
to

1532
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,559
schematic and at least add a few

1533
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,400
components where i can then

1534
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,040
use it to show you how these interactive

1535
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,440
routing features work so let me start by

1536
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,000
adding

1537
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,240
a hierarchical sheet click here once

1538
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:05,919
click again and give it a name

1539
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:11,440
routing routing

1540
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,760
click ok let me escape creating the

1541
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,200
hierarchical sheets

1542
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,599
feature and double click here to enter

1543
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:18,720
this sheet

1544
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,440
and let me add a couple of components

1545
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,160
quickly so

1546
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,920
a to add parts grab a resistor

1547
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,960
and say okay zoom in a bit

1548
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,240
r to rotate it once click it once

1549
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,280
let me add the values so

1550
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,000
so 10k let me add the footprint as well

1551
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,799
so if for footprint

1552
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:45,440
go to select and choose this actual

1553
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,799
footprint and click on ok all right so

1554
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,000
now let me

1555
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,599
duplicate this c for copy move it down

1556
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:54,880
like so

1557
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,079
copy it once again place it here copy

1558
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:58,960
this one

1559
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,760
place it here now let's draw a couple of

1560
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,400
tracks

1561
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,160
use the track symbol start here end it

1562
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:06,960
here

1563
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,240
start here and end this

1564
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,799
and over here for example this could be

1565
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:13,599
my

1566
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:17,200
differential pair for example

1567
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,839
and over here

1568
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,960
like so okay so with the

1569
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,359
wires drawn let's annotate the four

1570
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:31,280
parts that we've placed so here's

1571
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,799
annotate symbols click on annotate

1572
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,920
and then let's close it for

1573
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,720
differential pairs to work kicad expects

1574
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,079
that the pair of wires

1575
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,039
are labeled in a certain way so we need

1576
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,319
to use the

1577
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:50,400
net label feature and select one wire

1578
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,920
and the options by which you can

1579
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,119
label this is a sum name for example

1580
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:01,039
d for data and then the symbol plus or

1581
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,920
underscore p one of these two options so

1582
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:04,799
let's go with

1583
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:08,079
d plus and click ok

1584
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,319
and place it here and then the

1585
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,440
corresponding

1586
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,480
label for the other wire will be d

1587
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,000
minus or d underscore m since we have

1588
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,799
used d plus

1589
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,680
we'll have to use d minus over here

1590
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,319
click

1591
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:25,520
ok place it here just

1592
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,400
save our schematic create a netlist

1593
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,240
although like i mentioned earlier

1594
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,960
this is not always necessary and now we

1595
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,000
can

1596
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,280
go to our circuit board layout zoom out

1597
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,000
a bit

1598
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,359
and update the pcb by using this

1599
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,880
option click on update click on close

1600
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,440
and i have these four resistors over

1601
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,240
here so let's

1602
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,559
place them somewhere move this and

1603
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,280
rotate it around and place it here so

1604
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:55,839
that's

1605
01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:01,119
d plus the other one so let's

1606
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,319
grab that r to rotate it

1607
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,520
and place it like so and let's take the

1608
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,000
other one

1609
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
r4 click on it aim to move rotate it

1610
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,240
180 degrees and then let me

1611
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,400
kind of place it somewhere over here

1612
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:27,839
and then grab the last one m to move it

1613
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,119
rotate it and

1614
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,839
place it like so over here so with that

1615
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,520
we are ready to now

1616
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,960
draw the tracks let's first do the

1617
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,960
ones that are not the differential pair

1618
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,240
so start here

1619
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,440
and like so

1620
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,799
let me draw the

1621
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:56,640
other one here like so

1622
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,720
now let's say we want both of these

1623
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,079
tracks to be the same

1624
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,640
length we can do that using the route

1625
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,400
tune track length option

1626
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,720
but before we do that we need to know

1627
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,599
the length

1628
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,760
of one of these two tracks so that we

1629
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,760
can set that as a parameter that needs

1630
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,240
to be

1631
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,359
tuned so as we saw in the

1632
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:18,400
plugins we can choose this segment

1633
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,440
then press u to select this whole

1634
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,640
section of track go to tools external

1635
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,920
plugins

1636
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,200
measure length for selected tracks this

1637
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:33,039
piece of track is 23.342 mm

1638
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:35,440
measure the other one so select a

1639
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,160
segment

1640
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,200
you to select the whole section tools

1641
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,520
plugins measure length 21.310

1642
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,720
so they are both of a different length

1643
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,599
and let's say we want both of them to be

1644
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:50,240
one inch

1645
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,640
in length so the way you make that work

1646
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,400
is click route

1647
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,119
click on tune track length zoom in on

1648
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,160
this track

1649
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,079
right click on this segment once and

1650
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:01,359
you'll get the length

1651
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,920
tuning settings click that the target

1652
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,480
length

1653
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,680
that's what we need to set as one inch

1654
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,240
and then you can have settings for a

1655
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,839
couple of other parameters so let's

1656
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,920
select a target length of one inch and

1657
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:14,720
say okay

1658
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,480
and then once i clicked on a segment and

1659
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,760
i moved my mouse a bit

1660
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,799
it tuned it to exactly one inch

1661
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:26,079
you'll notice it says here too short

1662
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:29,920
and here it says as attuned i can

1663
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,240
increase the spacing like so and you can

1664
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,280
see that the

1665
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,839
length has now become too long i'm using

1666
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:36,480
the

1667
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,799
number key one to increase the spacing

1668
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:40,720
and if i press the number key

1669
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,760
two i can reduce the spacing like so and

1670
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,640
i can press

1671
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,559
three to change the amplitude like so

1672
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:52,640
or i can press 4 to reduce it like so

1673
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,680
you'll notice that kakad tunes it to a

1674
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,200
certain length and gives you

1675
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,359
the report that this is tuned to 1 inch

1676
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:00,880
let's then

1677
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,680
repeat it for the other one as well

1678
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,880
click on this segment

1679
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,160
and keep drawing it like this until

1680
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,280
it reports that it has been tuned click

1681
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,799
on it once and that's done

1682
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:14,400
so we have these two tracks that are

1683
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,880
tuned to a length of one inch we can

1684
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,880
verify that by clicking on this segment

1685
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,359
once then you to select the whole track

1686
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:24,240
tools plugins measure length and it says

1687
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,720
this length is 25.4 let's check the

1688
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,440
other one

1689
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,680
click on a segment you to select the

1690
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,599
whole track tools

1691
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,760
plugins length 25.4 and that's how

1692
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,720
track length tuning works let's look at

1693
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,799
differential pairs now

1694
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,880
i select the differential pair routing

1695
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,400
option click on

1696
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,480
one of the two pads where the

1697
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,079
differential pair starts from

1698
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:50,240
like so and you'll notice packet now

1699
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,359
draws a

1700
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,839
pair of tracks instead of a single track

1701
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:54,960
and now i can

1702
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,000
lay it out like any regular track

1703
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,039
like so and that's your differential

1704
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:02,000
track done

1705
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,160
now if you have a whole bunch of such

1706
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,000
differential track and you want all of

1707
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,839
them to have the same length then we can

1708
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:10,000
use a similar process as we use for

1709
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:10,480
these

1710
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,280
individual track lens to tune the length

1711
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:13,920
of this

1712
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,719
differential pair and we can do that by

1713
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:17,679
selecting the

1714
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:20,319
tuned differential pair length option

1715
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,158
once again before we do that we need to

1716
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:24,080
know an approximate idea what

1717
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,000
length we are trying to achieve so let

1718
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,839
me select this segment

1719
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,560
u for the whole track go to tools

1720
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,279
plugins

1721
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:36,479
measure length and this is 100.629 mm

1722
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,040
let's say that our target length is 120

1723
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,080
mm

1724
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,120
so we go to route tune differential pair

1725
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:43,920
length

1726
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,319
right click over here or control l to

1727
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:47,040
get the

1728
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,158
tuning settings and let's say instead of

1729
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:52,799
120 we want to make it 125 mm

1730
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:56,000
so that's roughly 5 inches and once

1731
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,238
again you can set amplitude and spacing

1732
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:01,279
min max values but let's click ok

1733
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,640
and now if you click on

1734
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,920
one of these pairs once and start

1735
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,158
moving your mouse you'll see that it

1736
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:12,158
starts adding meanders over here

1737
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,120
and it keeps providing you a report of

1738
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:15,679
the

1739
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:18,799
existing length so we keep moving until

1740
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:22,560
we hit the target

1741
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,040
like so and if you're in a cramped space

1742
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,238
and you notice that

1743
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,319
you aren't able to achieve it using this

1744
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:29,439
you can

1745
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,560
then change the parameters like the

1746
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,600
amplitude

1747
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,560
like so for example and click it once

1748
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,198
and

1749
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:39,759
you have this differential pair which is

1750
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,359
tuned to a length of

1751
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,279
five inches let's verify it click on

1752
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,479
this segment once

1753
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:48,238
click you go to tools plugins measure

1754
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:49,040
length

1755
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,640
and it's a 127 mm perfect so as of now

1756
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,320
there is no skew in this

1757
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,280
particular pair of differential tracks

1758
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:57,600
but

1759
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,520
if there was then you could also use the

1760
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,040
tune differential pairs q

1761
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,000
phase option to get that sorted once

1762
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,400
again

1763
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,199
you right click you get the target skew

1764
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,239
what's the minimum

1765
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,400
that is acceptable you can then move

1766
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,239
your mouse over here and it'll adjust

1767
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:12,960
the length of

1768
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,679
one of the two tracks until both of them

1769
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,440
have the exact same length

1770
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,320
so that's the advanced options in

1771
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,280
interactive

1772
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,960
routing before i proceed let me just

1773
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,440
delete this whole block because we don't

1774
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,960
really need this let's just

1775
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,440
a demonstration of the features so

1776
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,560
select all of that

1777
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,760
delete click home save it once and

1778
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,440
i'm going to leave the schematic as it

1779
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,360
is

1780
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,679
so that brings us to the close of

1781
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:43,040
session three

1782
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,199
if you have any questions i'd be happy

1783
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,239
to answer them

1784
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:50,159
and we'll meet during the next office

1785
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,080
hours
