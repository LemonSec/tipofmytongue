00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,000
hey everyone this is our

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,559
fourth session at hackaday on quantum

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,440
computing

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,360
i know there are still some newcomers

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,119
today but don't worry we have

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,880
recordings made for

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,000
people to look back so everything is on

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,519
the hackaday

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,560
project you can find the slides and the

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,279
recording

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,880
so we had three sessions in the past

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
these are the concepts that we covered

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,879
before so just to recap

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,079
in the last three sessions we

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,320
talked about some basic concepts for

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,800
quantum computing

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,960
primarily the superposition is a main

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,039
reason for the the second and the third

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,800
interesting aspects of quantum mechanics

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
so interference is

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,479
showing the result so the result of

23
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,240
interference is what we see

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
in measurements and entanglement

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,400
is another strange thing enabled by

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,240
superposition that

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
uh when qubits are entangled their

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,520
results are

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,479
correlated so those are the two main or

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,840
three main things that we

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,159
in the last three sessions if you miss

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,240
them don't worry you can go back to the

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,600
recording

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,000
but those are the fundamental

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,880
basics of quantum mechanics that we are

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,680
using

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,479
in quantum computing so today we're

38
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,920
going to talk about

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,360
actually how do we make use of

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,040
the qubits we've described what

41
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,320
qubit is with

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,159
some mathematics and also just

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,680
conceptually

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,960
is like the classical bit but then

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,040
superposition allows it to be

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,318
at a percentage certain probability

47
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,399
of being state zero and certain

48
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,599
probability of in state one

49
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,640
and we can of course

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,440
describe it differently with a graphic

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,840
view

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,599
so here a graphic representation

53
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,800
of a real number we are all very

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,720
familiar when we were kids we learned

55
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,760
that we can draw

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,959
them in a line and it's just

57
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,400
a real number that you can

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,560
get different lengths for different

59
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,640
numbers

60
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,040
when it becomes a complex number when we

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,840
are talking about complex number we can

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,720
um then represent it in

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,080
card in it that will show you both the

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,040
magnitude and the phase so that's how we

65
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,599
can

66
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,360
graphically represent complex numbers so

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,000
in terms of cubits we can also use

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,640
graphic

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,760
representations so here this is

70
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,640
a geometry that we can use is basically

71
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,239
a sphere

72
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,120
to represent this vector which is our

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,760
qubit

74
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,560
so it has the amplitudes a and b

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,120
for the zero state or the one state

76
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,720
and it's just a three-dimensional

77
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,959
so actually the surface of the sphere is

78
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,200
2d but it's a sphere

79
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,720
and it gives us two parameters

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,920
one is the the theta one is the phi here

81
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,000
so

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,040
the on the block sphere the top one

83
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,799
is state zero and the bottom one is

84
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,879
state one and then any arbitrary

85
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,519
state you can represent it on this block

86
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,120
sphere

87
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,519
so our phi is the arbitrary state

88
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,680
and it has a theta angle away from the z

89
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,879
axis and angle

90
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,879
phi away from the x axis so this allows

91
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,720
us to write down how to represent

92
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,759
the state phi with these angles so

93
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,280
this is a pure this is pure geometry

94
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,880
um and the useful thing that we do this

95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
is that

96
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,160
the angles now is basically in a

97
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,440
polar coordinate and it can give us

98
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,680
these ampules a and b so we just

99
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,560
represent

100
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,919
the amplitudes with these angles in the

101
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,880
sphere

102
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,600
so because it's a sphere it has all

103
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,560
kinds of

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
possibilities this phi can be anywhere

105
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
on this sphere and we will just use a

106
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,199
different number for theta and phi

107
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,199
to give us the amplitude we want

108
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,960
so if you start with any state

109
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,759
you want to change it you want to

110
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,360
manipulate a and b

111
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,120
so basically you're just changing the

112
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,400
location of this

113
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,759
state on the block sphere so that's how

114
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,280
we're doing and last

115
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,600
class at the end someone asked the

116
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,199
question how do we

117
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
obtain the amplitudes that we want

118
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,080
if we represent it this way we can

119
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,240
visually realize that

120
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,479
as long as we can control the angles we

121
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,440
can get

122
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,800
the any number of the

123
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,400
amplitude we want

124
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,880
so as i described earlier the

125
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,000
0 and 1 are defined at those

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,840
two polar positions along the

127
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,960
z axis and then we can write out

128
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,639
mathematically how to find a arbitrary

129
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,560
state

130
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,759
so 0n1 we know that in classical case

131
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,800
we only have these two options but then

132
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,440
in the quantum case we have all limited

133
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,720
unlimited number of

134
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,080
options for a qubit so zero and one

135
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,039
are nothing but two special cases so

136
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,120
classical states are just two special

137
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,759
cases

138
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,039
for a quantum state when

139
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,479
theta is either 0 or 180 degrees

140
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,360
so you can you can just think about

141
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,720
classical

142
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,240
bits as part of a complete qubit system

143
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,240
and then we want to know how

144
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,840
we can manipulate it just by changing

145
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,479
the theta and fine so

146
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,639
geometrically you can just see that we

147
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,759
can use

148
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,880
matrices to apply to

149
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,960
a two by one vector and we can

150
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,919
have a matrix that changes the angle phi

151
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,319
and

152
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,880
another matrix that changes the angle

153
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,599
theta

154
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,240
so that's all that's it this is a very

155
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,020
generalized

156
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,440
[Music]

157
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,360
method to change qubit states

158
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,919
and people can also call these a

159
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,720
universal

160
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,560
gate set so it gives you an unlimited

161
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,599
number of options for your theta and

162
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,840
phi there's infinite

163
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,199
options so this is

164
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,160
all the possible positions you can lie

165
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,960
on a block sphere

166
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,639
but in in terms of algorithms

167
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,160
and computing it would be impossible to

168
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,360
use always a

169
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,800
arbitrary number of possible gates

170
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,560
to apply to your qubit so we

171
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,199
have a set of

172
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,319
simplified or special cases

173
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,080
for these two general matrices

174
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,919
that we use as common gates

175
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,560
the idea of a common gate is kind of

176
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,360
like

177
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,639
um making a metaphor here

178
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,720
coins is partly convention partly

179
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,560
scientific that

180
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,319
these are the smallest number of

181
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,599
uh coins that we could add up

182
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,958
or combine to get any number we want

183
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,919
so that's what all our currency is kind

184
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,440
of using we're not

185
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
uh doing one two three four five six

186
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
which is doing one

187
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,519
two five and then 10 20 because any

188
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,680
combination a small number of them

189
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,200
can let us get a

190
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,640
arbitrary number but then this is again

191
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,320
a very simplified

192
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,080
version here we are only looking at

193
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,440
real numbers and is not doing any

194
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,160
complex

195
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,080
number we don't have complex money

196
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,600
whereas in the cubic case we have

197
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,880
a lot more locations

198
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,519
infinite number of locations that state

199
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,399
can lie on

200
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,720
on the bloch sphere but then the idea is

201
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,240
that

202
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,120
we can have some simple forms of these

203
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,920
matrices

204
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,720
that we can use and combine them to get

205
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,120
to

206
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,480
the positions we want on the sphere

207
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,800
and that will also mean that it's not

208
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,760
continuous

209
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,200
is discrete it can put us to

210
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,240
a place on the blog sphere that's

211
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,200
mostly used some of the places just in

212
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,959
terms of computing will not

213
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,480
always trying to get there so

214
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,920
let me give you some examples of these

215
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,040
commonly used gates

216
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,720
the one set of gates is called the

217
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,560
polygate so paulie is

218
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,680
one of the famous

219
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,920
physicists from the 1960s

220
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,560
so there are a lot of things named after

221
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,440
him

222
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,200
and in the blog sphere we can see

223
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,360
that we can rotate around the x-axis

224
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,480
and the polygame x

225
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,920
is basically allowing us to

226
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,399
rotate along the x-axis by 180 degrees

227
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,040
if your initial state is zero by

228
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,880
applying this gate

229
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,760
it will just flip to one

230
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,279
and it's the same as the the not gays in

231
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,040
classical cases you're just

232
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,800
flipping zeros and ones um so if you can

233
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
rotate around x axis you can also rotate

234
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,000
around

235
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,600
the other two x's so for example y axis

236
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,720
and then also the z axis around

237
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,240
so the z gate and the y gates the i

238
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,880
and minus signs here are just phase

239
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,360
that's

240
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,240
added if you do the math if you want to

241
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,279
use the matrix

242
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,640
generalize matrices and try to

243
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,480
apply a particular

244
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,519
angle like 180 degrees and check

245
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,920
these out you you see you will end up

246
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,120
with some phase

247
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,320
factors added in them so y is

248
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,839
rotating around y axis and z

249
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,959
gates is very commonly used it's just

250
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,519
rotating here you you don't actually

251
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,040
change

252
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,800
the the qubit other than adding a phase

253
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,760
there

254
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,920
um and this is also redundant we

255
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,279
actually just need

256
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,399
x and z the two gates

257
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,440
in order to get a y gate so you don't

258
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,000
have to

259
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
to actually use y so if you don't

260
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,279
believe it try to

261
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,560
calculate it apply a z

262
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,839
and x in series and then see

263
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,839
if you can get this matrix out

264
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,959
and

265
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,160
here is again to show you graphically

266
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,839
how

267
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,560
x is rotating around set is changing phi

268
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,160
and then that uh sorry x is the

269
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,959
z is rotating around z axis and changing

270
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,600
phi ends

271
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,440
x is rotating around x changing theta

272
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,560
and i would highly encourage you to

273
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,600
i told people to bring paper and pen to

274
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
this class

275
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,760
to check if this is the case just try a

276
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,320
matrix

277
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
multiplication and

278
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,399
see if this is the case

279
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,399
and i hope that everyone has paper and

280
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,720
pen by their desk

281
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,320
i would be surprised if you don't have

282
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
it on your computer on your desk

283
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,600
another very useful gate is

284
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,200
the hard mart or h gate tatama is again

285
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,560
a person's name is

286
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,000
a two by two matrix that has a

287
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,519
square root of two for all the

288
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,800
elements and they're

289
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,079
almost a um

290
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,240
so the quad quadrants are almost

291
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,440
identical except

292
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,480
the last one has minus sign here

293
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,320
so i would like to have you guys

294
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,040
try to do this matrix at a

295
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,279
multiplication onto

296
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,880
either the zero state or the one state

297
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,959
just try it out to see what you get

298
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,120
and do people still remember how to

299
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,199
multiply matrices

300
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,880
you can comment here in messaging

301
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,760
um just reading messages here

302
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,880
see if there's something

303
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,040
okay i can answer some questions as you

304
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
guys try it

305
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,839
so first one from

306
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,440
bob equation makes zero the equation

307
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
makes zero and one vectors look

308
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,880
orthogonal but the sphere shows some

309
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,600
yeah so they're on the pole so don't

310
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,399
consider

311
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,680
the block sphere as any geometrical

312
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,480
representation or any physical geometry

313
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,760
of anything

314
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,120
and also don't think about as

315
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,279
a physical qubit that's actually

316
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,959
flipping

317
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,760
it is just a mathematical representation

318
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,040
for you to visualize it

319
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,399
and yeah and i also

320
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,680
commented on that thank you

321
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,480
when you say gate is it the amount of

322
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,160
voltage that applies no

323
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,560
is a different type of gate uh so this

324
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,279
is

325
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,480
a common conventional

326
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,519
naming after the classical

327
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,240
logic gate this is the quantum logic

328
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,120
gate which is

329
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,240
just a operation that you apply

330
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,639
to your components

331
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,920
in your algorithm so it has nothing to

332
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,480
do with

333
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,519
uh voltages although

334
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,800
it does it actually yes in

335
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,839
in some sense uh if you build a certain

336
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,480
type of hardware that uses voltage to

337
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,680
control

338
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,880
the qubits then it is dependent on the

339
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
voltage but it's not like a one-to-one

340
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,639
mapping to

341
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,680
your physical circuit and

342
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,680
algorithm so i'll get back to these

343
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,920
let's review the answers i hope you guys

344
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,199
get

345
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,560
finished so what

346
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,839
i expect you to do is to do this matrix

347
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,680
application

348
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,040
to the vector if you start with zero

349
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,240
then you should get this vector out

350
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,759
so that's putting zero and one equal

351
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,639
probability and we call this we

352
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,639
simplified it as a plus sign

353
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,000
it's a new new state if you use

354
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,480
one as your initial state then you will

355
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,279
get

356
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,480
again equal probability but with

357
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,600
minus sign and as we previously talked

358
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,000
about

359
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,759
amplitude that they could be

360
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,600
plus minus or even complex so

361
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,360
these are two again polar

362
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,360
states and if you represent them on the

363
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,800
block sphere

364
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,639
they are in between the zero and one

365
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,160
state

366
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,440
and it's pretty intuitive that

367
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,119
you're just changing the axis from here

368
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,319
to this one and in a way that uh

369
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,160
you could say that if you start with a

370
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,599
classical

371
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,039
zero one case then

372
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,520
the hadamard gates could put your system

373
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,319
in a

374
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,799
quantum mechanical case when zero and

375
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,679
one are in

376
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,119
superposition and here are some other

377
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,960
commonly used gates they are all derived

378
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,640
from the z gate they just

379
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,840
a subset and

380
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,120
they can rotate around the z axis by

381
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,840
different degrees

382
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,480
so these are all for single qubits

383
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,160
and i wanted to show that

384
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,360
the block sphere when you first learn

385
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,400
about

386
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,360
this quantum gate and manipulation of

387
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,160
qubits

388
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,880
is an easy tool for you to visualize

389
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,280
what's happening to your qubit

390
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,480
and here is a short video from ibm

391
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,360
a long time ago they were trying to show

392
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,039
that

393
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,320
in terms of bits so you only have

394
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,360
two options but then in the classical

395
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,760
you know quantum bits then you will have

396
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,480
all these

397
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,240
different options that could be

398
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,720
represented on blocks here

399
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,559
but we already see that we're already

400
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,160
using a three-dimensional object to

401
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,160
visualize these this two by one vector

402
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,880
if you had more qubits that would be

403
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,600
multi-dimensional

404
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,919
and as humans we wouldn't be able to

405
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:44,960
visualize it

406
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,640
so this graph here is trying to

407
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,039
put a five qubit into a sphere but this

408
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,960
is a multi-dimensional sphere so it

409
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,280
doesn't actually help us

410
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,320
so block sphere is a nice

411
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,039
representation when you're only using

412
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,400
single qubit

413
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,679
but then if you scale it to multi cubits

414
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,080
it's

415
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,120
not going to help so that's that's that

416
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,440
and

417
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,559
when we go to multiple qubits we will

418
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,720
not be using block sphere anymore

419
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,240
unless you're looking at them

420
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,120
individually

421
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,120
so a gate

422
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,440
or quantum operation is just a matrix

423
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
that you can apply to your qubit

424
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,600
which are represented as vectors

425
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,120
there's no requirement of how the

426
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,559
matrix looks like except it needs to be

427
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,640
unitary

428
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,760
so those of you who study maths would

429
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,600
know what unitarity means

430
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,280
if not here is the definition

431
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,520
but don't worry about it so much why do

432
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,120
we need

433
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
gates to be unitary that's more

434
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,240
important

435
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,640
it's because we need to make sure that

436
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,000
the quantum gate is

437
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,240
reversible having matrices being unitary

438
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,559
allows it to be reversible and what does

439
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,919
it mean it just means that

440
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,039
when you apply your gate to your qubit

441
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,400
and when you do a reverse of it and

442
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,480
you could reverse back to where you

443
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,240
started

444
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,000
so unitarity guarantees your matrix to

445
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,200
be reversible

446
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,240
and also that could allow the

447
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,360
probabilities to add up to one

448
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,039
and the reason uh the definition of

449
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,760
unitarity is

450
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,120
basically the is called a u is a

451
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,240
dagger dagger means the complex

452
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,320
conjugate transposed

453
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,400
and you if you time these two you will

454
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,159
get the

455
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,200
identity matrix and that's that's all it

456
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,760
means

457
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,960
that's unitary so you can try this math

458
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,919
later if you like

459
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,159
okay so we have like eight minutes left

460
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,840
i do want to point to you

461
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,880
where you can

462
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,720
have more

463
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,919
[Music]

464
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,200
understanding of gates and so you can

465
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,640
actually get hands-on

466
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,320
with this exercises we developed

467
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,679
microsoft so this is a tata

468
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,240
a set of cutters that you can use to try

469
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:45,200
learning these concepts we talked about
