2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,639
welcome

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,759
everyone and welcome back to

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,080
people who have been following this is

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,320
our 17th session

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,320
and also so about nine sessions ago we

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,800
started

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,400
some coding exercises so

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,359
is we have all of the recordings

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,159
posted on hackaday this is the quantum

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,040
computing through

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,480
comics class and all of the slides and

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,559
past recordings are there

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,040
and you can jump around you don't have

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,120
to follow from the beginning

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,960
in order because we also have repeated

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
content maybe it helps you if you

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,559
say looking at groovers we had a

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,519
theoretical group

20
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,440
class cause several uh sessions

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,840
pass there are several sessions in

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,000
between them you can skip

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
so uh all of the titles are there and

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,560
the content are listed on

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,600
the hackadays slides so you can see what

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,799
are the relevant

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,640
materials do you want to

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,280
look if there's no special events like

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,720
last week we have

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,759
a 30 minute to an hour

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,880
discussion on one topic and we use the

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,840
microsoft's

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,880
q q sharp dot as well as

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
the quantum catalyst for

35
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,680
down quite a lot of classes so far

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,759
already and uh for people who have been

37
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,360
following i i really would

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,479
say congratulations to

39
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,360
follow uh to this point because we have

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
already covered a lot of the basic

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,920
concepts

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,640
linear algebra and with the coding and

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,759
we talked about

44
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,119
quite a few different types of

45
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,799
algorithms and

46
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,200
for people who have seen like grover's

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,239
algorithm deutsch hosa algorithm

48
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,440
and some of the other

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,400
algorithms that uses entanglements like

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,920
communication algorithms

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,520
and also interference that you

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
kind of have probably have a fear of how

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
used for computing could be

54
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,959
and you can see the power of quantum

55
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,239
computers when

56
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,440
is using all of the basic concepts

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,200
superposition entanglement and

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,440
interference that we can really harness

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,319
to make algorithms that's more efficient

60
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,599
for certain tasks

61
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,959
than classical computers and it's also

62
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,319
very nice that

63
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,280
i'm getting feedback from learners

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,560
telling me where

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,400
quantum computing clicked for them

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,680
because

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,200
at the very first time when you look at

68
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
it it might not be immediately obvious

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,080
but then after

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,760
several classes some people really

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,560
understood oh this is how it works and

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,120
um

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
then it becomes there's this there's a

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,599
learning curve but then it becomes

75
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,519
easier for them after that point

76
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,840
so thanks for the people who have been

77
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,120
giving me feedback

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
so today we're going to talk about

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,959
schwartz as a

80
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,400
one of the most famous algorithms and

81
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,080
uh that's also kind of if you look at a

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,560
lot of

83
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,519
learning materials

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,519
is not taught early because it all

85
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,000
it really is using a lot of the concept

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,879
that we learned

87
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,920
before um so if you're following

88
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,080
up to this point pat yourself on the

89
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,760
shoulder you're really getting is no

90
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,680
longer really introductory

91
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,720
anymore you're looking at in that is

92
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,000
using

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,040
these concepts and can really show

94
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,159
the power of quantum computing uh by

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,439
using these special

96
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,959
properties for quantum

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,319
in quantum mechanics yeah and schwarz

98
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,319
algorithm is also one of the useful

99
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,360
algorithms

100
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
not just academic for academic training

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,920
it actually has a application that could

102
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
be very very impactful

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,720
short you can even find his own

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,000
explanation of his algorithm

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
this algorithm is invented by peter

106
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
short

107
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,880
in 1994 and there is a nice

108
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,280
two-minute video on youtube peter shaw

109
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,000
himself

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,600
explaining it so in fact uh and now uh

111
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,360
a minute and a half into the video

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
he's kind of summarized everything that

113
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,000
we learned in the past

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,560
and then he just used a couple of

115
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,880
sentences summarizing uh how

116
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,479
really schwarz algorithm works but he

117
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,720
caught it i think it's being modest he

118
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,199
called it

119
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,759
quantum algorithm in general but it is

120
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,960
really using

121
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,639
interference and entanglement so i

122
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,320
recommend this video very short very

123
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,639
succinct

124
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,080
but at the first time when you look at

125
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,240
it may not have seemed that he's

126
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,800
really explained much but then after you

127
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,320
go through short's algorithm a couple of

128
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,960
times

129
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,680
just and go back to this video you will

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,160
see

131
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,639
that's actually exactly what's happening

132
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,000
it's a great video i don't know why

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,039
people are downloading

134
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,199
there's always people giving but

135
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,560
let's just take a look what's source

136
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,080
algorithm

137
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,800
uh used for and how does it work

138
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,960
are we gonna spend a couple of classes

139
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
discussing this

140
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,800
just like how we did with groovers um i

141
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,680
think for

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,000
a lot of these algorithms the very first

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,320
time you see it might not be obvious

144
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,800
but after a couple of times you see the

145
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,759
pattern

146
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,360
so schwarz algorithm is used

147
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,479
for and also is

148
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,880
a potential threat to the current rsa

149
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,280
encryption scheme this is

150
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,479
our encryption methods to

151
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,680
encode messages um i'm not an expert in

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
cryptography

153
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,960
and there are a lot of already existing

154
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,280
write-ups and

155
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,720
documentation about uh specifically how

156
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,680
rrsa works so we're gonna do an overview

157
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,240
just

158
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,039
for the sake of the level of this class

159
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:29,440
with

160
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,759
doing um we will do a very short

161
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,840
overview of this

162
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,199
and uh so how rsa works is it

163
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,240
uses a public key and a private key

164
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,680
for message exchange and it's relying

165
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,880
some mathematical facts so

166
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,400
here bob has a public key and

167
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,319
he uses this public key e

168
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,520
to encrypt a message

169
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,599
using this m to the power of e mod n

170
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,479
and n is a number and turned out the

171
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,160
number needs to be really

172
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,319
really large we'll talk about it in a

173
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,520
bit so

174
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,720
n is public e is public

175
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,440
so he does this encryption and then

176
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,319
sends the message to alice

177
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,039
she then uses a private key to decode it

178
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,000
so c to the power of the mod n will give

179
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,479
her

180
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,759
the original message but it really

181
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,479
relies on

182
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,440
really large so the few uh mathematical

183
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,000
effects that rsa is using is basically

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,039
these

185
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,080
four equations e

186
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,280
to the power of e

187
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,400
and mod n will give you the original

188
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,479
message so you can

189
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,000
check the math that's how it is and n is

190
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,440
a very

191
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,120
large you can create by multiplying two

192
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,520
also pretty big could be big numbers

193
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,639
p and q and these

194
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,039
two numbers are unknown so if you know

195
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:15,840
these

196
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,759
if you created this number and using

197
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,919
these two numbers you know what it is

198
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,199
and you will get

199
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,240
doing multiplication is very easy

200
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,360
but if you just know n if it's

201
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,759
really big it's very difficult to

202
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,720
factorize

203
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,399
and get to these two numbers

204
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,120
and there's another number involved r

205
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,000
that also

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,519
relies on p and r p and q

207
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,880
and then you will need this e times d

208
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,200
mod r equal to one to be your condition

209
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,480
so this is

210
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,760
uh basically how this whole

211
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,959
rsa is using four

212
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,640
facts and publicly known numbers are n

213
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,920
and e but the other four p q d and r are

214
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,120
private

215
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,120
so if you want to uh to

216
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,640
decipher your message you need to

217
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,240
have a you need to have

218
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,120
the private key d but you also have to

219
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,600
know

220
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,839
uh p and q in order to get

221
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,880
dnr so if n is really really large

222
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,480
is invisible to factorize classically we

223
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,760
don't have any

224
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,240
uh algorithm that is efficient in

225
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,760
legitimization within a reasonable

226
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,800
amount of time

227
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,240
is not impossible but it's just relying

228
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,480
on the fact that we create a super huge

229
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,440
end

230
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,839
and then rely on the fact that no

231
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,440
classical algorithm

232
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,399
can break that and that's how we've been

233
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,279
creating

234
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,399
encrypting messages so you can you can

235
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,200
already sense the potential threat here

236
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,320
and especially with quantum computers

237
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,120
coming in

238
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,320
there could be algorithms as we'll see

239
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,000
short algorithm very efficient

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
way to break the factor

241
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,839
of n so let's

242
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,760
look a little bit more so here's that we

243
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,279
have

244
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,720
uh p uh giving it a number

245
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,279
or q these are not very big numbers

246
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,959
because we're trying to use it as an

247
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:33,839
example but

248
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,519
in real case they will have a lot of

249
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,959
digits and

250
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,600
in consequence the large number n will

251
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,160
have

252
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,920
many many many many digits

253
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,880
and then uh if we know if we have p and

254
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,200
q

255
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,640
we'll get r and then we need to

256
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,079
create uh two numbers

257
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,680
e and d that are relative primes to n

258
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,279
and for which e times d needs to be

259
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,640
one mod r so say if you

260
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,440
have e is public so you have e equal to

261
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,079
13

262
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,399
then you have d

263
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,680
for knight 9477 in order to satisfy

264
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
this so this means mod

265
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,160
is if you divide

266
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,360
r by e times d the remainder of that

267
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,399
equals to 1.

268
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,920
that's just end is this number

269
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,959
so say if you have a message just call

270
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,279
it

271
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,959
one two three you can encrypt it

272
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,200
by doing this mathematical calculation

273
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,880
what's the remainder of this division

274
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,519
if you want to divide m by m to the

275
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,120
power of e

276
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,279
then you get this number here

277
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,880
so if you then this is a

278
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,639
encrypted message you send to to alice

279
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,200
and if alice wants to decrypt it she

280
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,360
would do this

281
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,839
cipher which is this number

282
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,760
and you also want to know the remainder

283
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,360
of the

284
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,800
division dividing m by cipher to the

285
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
power of d

286
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,360
and you get one two three back as the

287
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
original message so that's just a

288
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,600
numeric example to show you how this

289
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,760
works

290
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,839
so you can imagine if n is really big

291
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,519
then rsa

292
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,480
can be secure but then sure comes along

293
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
saying if you have a

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,079
quantum computer then i can really

295
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,480
break it very efficiently and not

296
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,519
surprisingly

297
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,079
as we have seen earlier all these very

298
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:52,800
useful

299
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,079
quantum algorithms are using

300
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,920
entanglement and

301
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,959
interference we are doing that

302
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,160
with shorts algorithm again so we

303
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,240
this class we look at this at a very

304
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,000
high level and in the next

305
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,040
maybe one or two classes we will go into

306
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,240
details i'll just walk you through the

307
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,480
setup here

308
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,360
basically what a short algorithm does is

309
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
having these several steps

310
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,160
you have a bunch of qubits that you're

311
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,279
pulling

312
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,519
and you make them into superposition so

313
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,120
this is pretty

314
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,279
normal by now if you have followed

315
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,320
previous classes

316
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
we're always putting all of the qubits

317
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,720
into circular position

318
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,519
and then you can entangle these input

319
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,839
qubits and output qubits so you tango

320
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,399
all of your your qubits you have all

321
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,440
these

322
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,720
interdependent qubits and with all of

323
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,160
the possible states

324
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,440
in superposition and then the next

325
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,480
step is having some

326
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,480
periodic states being the

327
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,680
overall system state in superposition

328
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,639
and because it's periodic and turns out

329
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
that the periodicity

330
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,240
is the number r then you can do

331
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,360
a quantum fourier transform

332
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,959
to obtain the number r

333
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,399
so this is a very very clever part the

334
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,440
quantum forward transform so

335
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,240
for people who who have learned other

336
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,880
types of

337
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
fire transforms in other applications

338
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,680
this is exactly the same

339
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,360
idea is that if you have something in

340
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,720
a periodic arrangement

341
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,680
but you don't know what the periodicity

342
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,040
is

343
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,000
you can do a transf fourier transform

344
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,040
you can obtain

345
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,399
a new set of uh functions

346
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,120
in order to give you the periodicity r

347
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,240
now this is how short's algorithm

348
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,480
would look like again not looking at

349
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,079
details this is one step zooming in

350
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,000
so it's got all these input qubits

351
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,279
like what we see in deutsch hosa

352
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,079
algorithm

353
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,480
guru's algorithm you have a bunch of

354
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,639
input qubits and a bunch of output

355
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,480
qubits

356
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,440
and this is the oracle that you always

357
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,240
need for this kind of interference

358
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,880
algorithms you want an oracle that takes

359
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,600
both of

360
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,480
both input and outputs and we're talking

361
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,040
about

362
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,160
a lot of qubits here because

363
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,199
n is large and you need to have

364
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,720
a number how do you know how many qubits

365
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,639
you need so basically you're looking at

366
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,240
the binary

367
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,240
system so 2 to the power of

368
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,240
number of qubits needs to be larger than

369
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,160
the number squared and then how many

370
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,600
output qubits do you need to put in

371
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,759
all number of qubits it needs to be

372
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,959
larger than

373
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,279
n minus one in the next class i will

374
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,240
show you some uh

375
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,519
detail exactly look at

376
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,440
what happens in these boxes

377
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,399
you're putting all of these things so

378
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,000
this uh each gate

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
is what's giving you the superposition

380
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,160
of all the all the possible

381
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,480
qubit states and you feed everything

382
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,279
what happens

383
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,240
is that you have all possible states

384
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,880
f of x is the um

385
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,480
you have the encoded x here so you will

386
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,040
have a function of f of x that equals

387
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,720
to a to the power of x mod n

388
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,360
and a here is a guess so

389
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,519
in the factorization of

390
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,519
n you classically probably just have to

391
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,040
guess

392
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,240
one by one is two

393
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,880
of a prime number of um

394
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,079
and that is five a prime of number of n

395
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,679
you keep guessing

396
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,079
um in schwarz algorithm we also need to

397
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
do some guesses

398
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,319
but it it will speed up using the rest

399
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,240
of the circuit

400
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,359
so you will have in this box

401
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,480
the entanglement of all these f of x

402
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,960
states with all the possible x

403
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,400
and then afterwards after this box

404
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,960
there's some something happening here

405
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,880
what you were left with

406
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,640
is a periodic set of states

407
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,720
and f of x equals to f of

408
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,760
x plus r this means this is a periodic

409
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,240
state r is the periodicity so

410
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,520
x is here adding a periodicity or pitch

411
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,760
of r you get the same thing adding

412
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,440
another r you get still get the same

413
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:05,840
thing

414
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,679
this is what a periodic state looks like

415
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,000
so after this box you get this periodic

416
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,280
states remaining

417
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
then you feed all of them into the

418
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,960
second box here

419
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,080
this is the quantum fourier transform

420
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,480
as i mentioned it transforms

421
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,400
the state or the superposition of all

422
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,360
these periodic

423
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,160
states into another superposition of

424
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,120
states but then

425
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,919
is a function of periodicity how do we

426
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,440
think about this

427
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,480
and there there are actually quite a few

428
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,919
analogies we can make but i

429
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,200
got especially inspired by the

430
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,480
one minute explanation from short

431
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,320
that this box

432
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,559
you can think about it like hey so what

433
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,000
what is the grading

434
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,679
so i'm stirring kind of new words to

435
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,480
people but

436
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,120
we have seen this before remember the

437
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,720
double slit experiments

438
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,320
we did quite a few classes ago when

439
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,280
we're talking about measurements

440
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,559
we have these double c

441
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,480
experiment that directly shows you the

442
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,960
effect

443
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,160
of quantum interference

444
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,320
remember that we had an electron beam

445
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,200
which is itself quantum mechanical

446
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
and then you're shooting that onto this

447
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,240
screen that has two slits

448
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,480
if you block one of them you get this

449
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,160
distribution of electrons

450
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,280
behind the screen behind this one slit

451
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,480
but when you unblock this one is not

452
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,400
as people classically thought that will

453
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,240
show two peaks like this

454
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,400
what happens is interference happens and

455
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,520
then you get constructive

456
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,520
interference even behind

457
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,280
this blocked region and then destructive

458
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,679
interference contributes to these dips

459
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,880
and dips could even appear behind the

460
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,600
slits

461
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,320
where you would expect more electrons

462
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,480
this is a direct manifestation of

463
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,919
quantum interference

464
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,200
and in the quantum fourier transform we

465
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,720
are using this exact

466
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,440
type of interference instead of having

467
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,080
two slits

468
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,200
now we have a

469
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,120
large number of slits it could be

470
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,360
infinite number of slits

471
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,799
and you have this basically the

472
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,120
periodicity are

473
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,679
so this is like a great thing you're

474
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,760
shooting electron beams again

475
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,640
but it can go through all of these slits

476
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,799
and it could be infinite

477
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,080
and you don't even you don't really know

478
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,200
the gratings

479
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,720
uh periodicity but then you can observe

480
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,440
the interference patterns afterwards and

481
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,080
this

482
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,640
can be i think by now it should be kind

483
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,400
of a

484
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,600
familiar phenomenon that you can think

485
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,799
about waterway

486
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,080
for sound waves if you have a lot of

487
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,640
them

488
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,080
interfering you will get this

489
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
interference patterns which are also

490
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,840
periodic

491
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,280
you can observe this and you know that's

492
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,400
the

493
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,400
after the interference these patterns

494
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,440
will have a periodic pitch that that is

495
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
proportional to one

496
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,159
of our so it is what this slit this

497
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,039
grating does is a forward transform it

498
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,480
transformed

499
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,799
from

500
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,520
this race into a reciprocal space

501
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
so if you measure if this is what you

502
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
can measure

503
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
you would know the is proportional to

504
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,480
one over r so in

505
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,919
this way you can infer r so that's what

506
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,200
exactly

507
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,559
uh the q of t the quantum fourier

508
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,480
transform in short star room does and

509
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,200
it's really

510
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,320
super cool it can be used in all kinds

511
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,039
of

512
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,919
situations when you want to find the

513
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,559
phase

514
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,559
and find the periodicity of your setup

515
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,280
so that's how this is done you just pass

516
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,000
through all

517
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,159
of your qubits and then it does this

518
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,679
transform and gives you

519
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,559
what you are looking for and that is

520
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,760
very efficient

521
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,520
you can do this if we had a working

522
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,200
quantum computer that's capable of

523
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,960
running shorts algorithm

524
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,760
then we'll be able to factorize this

525
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,039
large number n

526
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,480
very very fast and then our rsa

527
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,000
encryption will be broken

528
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,640
that's why we we're looking at it and

529
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,480
that's because we encrypt things

530
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,320
more securely perhaps using quantum

531
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,640
algorithms

532
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,600
that's a really quick broad overview and

533
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
also i'm

534
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,240
going to recommend some other videos

535
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,799
that kind of at similar introductory

536
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,840
level

537
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,120
there is one on uh is

538
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,559
also using drawings called the

539
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,960
how quantum computers break encryption

540
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,919
so it's a

541
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,000
a pretty fun short video that shows you

542
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,960
more details than what i just talked

543
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,240
about today

544
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,640
but we're going to go into that later

545
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,200
there's another one

546
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,240
by series by pbs and it's also a very

547
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,919
nice high-level

548
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,720
uh description about schwarz algorithm

549
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
and how the forward transform works

550
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,880
and how what they are using instead of

551
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,919
using gratings

552
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,640
is looking at the face is kind of a

553
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,679
clock that is

554
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,559
pointing at different directions based

555
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,440
on how

556
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,760
many remainders you have so

557
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,159
because schwarz algorithm needs probably

558
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,279
several iterations

559
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,400
in one's understanding to to get it

560
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,400
so if you want before we talk about it

561
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,360
next week

562
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,679
you should take a look at some of the

563
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,799
existing materials

564
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,320
there are a lot of mathematical

565
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
descriptions too we're going to go into

566
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,159
some of that next week

567
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,679
and a lot of math i'm trying to

568
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,880
not bog down by the maps but we're gonna

569
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
look at some maps next week

570
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,960
so yeah today is a quick class uh all of

571
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,600
the

572
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,720
hacker all of the recordings are on

573
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,919
hackaday project

574
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,120
this is a frequently asked question

575
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,960
all the recordings and slides are posted

576
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,919
and you can also find it on youtube i

577
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:40,720
also want to

578
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,640
get a sense here because i have been

579
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,720
getting a lot of questions from

580
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,000
people who are interested in quantum

581
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,520
having a career in quantum

582
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,240
and i wonder if there's any interest

583
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,279
that we can do

584
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:01,120
a q a session in

585
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,919
that i can answer questions that people

586
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,440
have about

587
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,240
uh getting a career getting a job in

588
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,840
quantum computing

589
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,240
so if yeah if you're interested feel

590
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,960
free to

591
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,520
let me know and post questions in the

592
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,640
chat

593
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:24,799
if this is something interesting
