easy to source components and 3d parts

entry-level printers complicated physics

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,359
aside ramen pie provides valuable

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,160
information about a wide range of

materials information that is relevant

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,539
and useful for a wide range of people

10
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,729
Raman pie can serve many functions it

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,260
can serve as a learning tool for

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,530
education and do-it-yourselfers it can

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,960
also serve as a useful tool in everyday

Things imagine a home with a ramen pipe

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,200
derivative designed to interface with

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,309
the homes incoming water supply this

18
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,110
device could run the family living in

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,149
the home if there are any contaminates

20
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,070
or dangerous compounds entering the

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,320
water supply it could warm you

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,449
immediately via text message a voice

23
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,699
alert in the home tweet or a complete

report shared on sites like Claude Lee

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,049
this could be potentially life-saving in

26
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,150
certain areas where the water supply is

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,909
questionable such a derivative would not

28
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,310
require much beyond a simple flow cubed

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,610
inserted into the qubit tray a

30
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,049
continuous monitor of your home's water

31
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,939
supply seems like a logical progression

32
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,889
for smart homes of the future
