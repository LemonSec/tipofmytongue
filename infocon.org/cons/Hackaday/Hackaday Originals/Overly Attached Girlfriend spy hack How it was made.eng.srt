1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,030
building the spy car was a lot of fun

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,769
and it turned out to be pretty easy too

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,420
i went to the toy store one of my

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,980
favorite places in the world and picked

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,650
up this intruder which is a car that is

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,529
able to broadcast a video feed and audio

7
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,960
is controlled by your phone but it

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,460
turned out it was too slow and

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,930
cumbersome it wasn't going to work for

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,980
what we needed so I toured apart and

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,430
mounted the bits and pieces on top of a

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,290
much much smaller but much stronger and

13
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:41,370
much faster lossy 4 by 4 car truck thing

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,010
anyway it was very fast and it was able

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,680
to carry the components pretty well the

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,489
only thing I had to add was a

17
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:51,600
microcontroller that would pull the

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,370
headlights of the intruder and when the

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,210
headlights would turn off the

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,710
microcontroller would turn a servo that

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,480
lifted an arm that deposited the GPS

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,980
device on the frame of the automobile

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,968
that the car was under
