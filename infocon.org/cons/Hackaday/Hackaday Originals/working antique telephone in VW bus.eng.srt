1
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,910
this is caleb from hackaday and I drive

2
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,690
this beautiful beast here the 1976 VW

3
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,070
microbus camper it's comfortable it's

4
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,590
spacious it sleeps four adults and it's

5
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,660
a pleasure to drive but like most old

6
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,579
vehicles like this it can get pretty

7
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,340
noisy once you reach about 40 or 50

8
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,160
miles an hour the road noise the engine

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,469
and the wind all combine to make it

10
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,870
nearly impossible to hear my kids in the

11
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,469
back yelling at us up in the front to

12
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,629
solve this for our next trip I'm going

13
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,400
to temporarily install a telephone

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,150
intercom system back here so that they

15
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,650
can converse with us on another

16
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,229
telephone up front let's get started the

17
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,119
circuit for this is extremely simple if

18
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,520
you cut open a standard telephone line a

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,710
standard for wire telephone line you'll

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,950
have four different colors inside you'll

21
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:36,979
have a red yellow black

22
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:42,640
and green we are not going to use the

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,860
black and green for this project though

24
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,890
so all we need are the green and the red

25
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,120
let's say you have a phone on either

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,480
side

27
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,720
if you take a standard cable and cut it

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,919
open you can discard the black and the

29
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:17,130
yellow we will have green and we will

30
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,710
have read you can actually go ahead and

31
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,350
connect the green from one side of the

32
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:31,680
cable to the red of the other but on

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,450
this side it's going to be a little bit

34
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,190
different here we're going to go to

35
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,390
negative or ground and a vehicle and

36
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,650
then from positive we're going to come

37
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,470
in and we're going to put a resistor and

38
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,220
then connect to the green i'm using a

39
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,630
680 ohm resistor because i'm at 12 volts

40
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,260
in a vehicle here this will allow your

41
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,080
two phones to communicate it won't make

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,580
them ring but you'll be able to talk

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,470
from one side to the other no problem

44
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,660
all right now that everything's wired up

45
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,640
let's give it a test can you hear me now

46
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,450
everything seems to be working pretty

47
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,570
good
