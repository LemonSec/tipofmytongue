00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
this is caleb with hackaday now I've

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,200
already had a lot of fun with the

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,359
developer kit from oculus rift that I

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,730
got the virtual reality headset and I've

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,990
been watching and it seems a lot of

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,309
other people want to try attaching

7
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,410
different sensors to there's things like

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,890
the Razer Hydra or web cams but

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,900
attaching things to the rift is proving

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,640
to be a bit problematic people are

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,970
resorting to things like duct tape I

12
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,529
thought it would be nice to maybe have

13
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,960
some clip-on faceplates or attachments

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,340
so you could attach your things nice and

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,149
easy without making a mess so I designed

16
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,270
some the first one I designed goes on

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,739
the velcro on the back of your head

18
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,040
looks a little bit like a bow tie this

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,140
is for people who are using motion

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,350
sensors or heavy objects kind of like

21
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,850
the Razer Hydra though it's not very

22
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,700
heavy this just slides on your velcro

23
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,170
and then I have velcro straps that I can

24
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,730
feed through these holes to attach the

25
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,739
Razer Hydra here on the back the second

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,330
item I created for the rift is for the

27
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,760
people that want to add cameras and

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,700
stuff to the front this is a clip-on

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,939
detachable faceplate it just snaps onto

30
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,979
the front of the rift in the tension

31
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,990
holds it pretty tight it doesn't wiggle

32
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,030
free on its own I imagine you have to

33
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,500
put something pretty heavy on there for

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,409
it to wiggle free this is actually built

35
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,180
modular you see I've got a little rack

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,369
on there for web cams might be a little

37
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,220
too small or something but you can strap

38
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:40,890
anything to that or you can feed velcro

39
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,920
through here to attach things directly

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,890
in the center of your vision all of

41
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,720
these will be available for free at

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,130
thingiverse you'll see the link down

43
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,810
below be sure to leave me a comment

44
