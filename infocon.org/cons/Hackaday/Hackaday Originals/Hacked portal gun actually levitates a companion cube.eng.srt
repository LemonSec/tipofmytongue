00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,799
welcome back the enrichment center

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,450
reminds you that the weighted companion

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,740
cube will never threaten to stab you and

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,960
infest cannot speak in the events that

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,000
the weighted companion cubes does face

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,670
the enrichment centre urges you to

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,340
disregard its advice like most of the

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,990
ideas that we see come along this one

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,300
started with wouldn't it be cool if and

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,550
it was wouldn't be cool if we can make a

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,320
work in gravity gun now of course we

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,970
can't make a real working gravity gun

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,740
but we could make something that looked

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,320
like it was working there was already a

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,660
portal gun available to purchase was

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,610
very good looking much better than I

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,230
would have been able to make myself and

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,120
so what I did was I started trying to

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,320
think of ways that I could levitate

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,420
something in front of it there's already

21
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,149
products out there that do this

22
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,930
levitating magnetic blurbs we got this

23
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,270
tore out the coil and mounted it on the

24
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,539
portal gun pull the magnet out of the

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,469
levitating globe it created our own

26
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:03,899
companion cube this is just a foam

27
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,150
companion cube where the magnet mounted

28
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,580
on the top once it gets to the correct

29
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,540
distance from the coil a microcontroller

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,070
takes over and holds it there levitating

31
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,040
in space this would make a good piece to

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,720
put on display because you can't move it

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,950
you can't pick it up and wave it around

34
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,119
as soon as you move it too much the

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,770
field breaks and it drops but overall we

36
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,869
think we pulled it off pretty well this

37
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,479
is Kara for hackin AECOM we'll see you

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,440
next time

39
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,710
[Music]

40
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,710
excellent
