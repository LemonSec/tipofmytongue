00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
this is kaleb with hackaday and i get a

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,710
lot of comments and emails asking me

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,569
about my workbench usually they're

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:07,950
telling me I should clean it up and it's

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,480
too cluttered but sometimes they're

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,460
asking what specific things they see in

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,519
the background or from or what they are

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,660
so I figured I would just take a few

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,380
moments to explain this workbench was my

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,330
grandfather's he built it himself and I

11
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,310
grew up playing on this workbench as did

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,920
my brothers my workbench functions not

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,130
only as a surface to do projects on but

14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,560
also as a gallery I try to put as many

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,360
pieces of projects that I do up here

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,510
whether they were successes or failures

17
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,920
it helps remind me of the things that

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,350
I've pulled off and keeps me inspired to

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,230
keep doing better I also think it's

20
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,489
pretty fun that people can watch my

21
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,110
videos and pick out things in the

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,760
background that might make them curious

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,460
or that they have possibly seen before

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,300
and recognized from our previous videos

25
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,320
another question I get asked frequently

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,320
is why I don't clean up the set before I

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,350
do videos the fact is this is actually

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,229
my workbench I work here I'm probably in

29
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:05,880
the middle of a project whenever I

30
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,890
decide to stop and start filming and

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,470
honestly I think showing that it's a

32
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,420
real workbench works better
