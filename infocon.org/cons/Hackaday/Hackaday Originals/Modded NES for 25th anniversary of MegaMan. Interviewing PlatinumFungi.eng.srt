1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
this is Caleb with hackaday and today we

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,470
have the great honor of having Ryan

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,080
Fitzpatrick also known as platinum fungi

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,940
in the workshop with us hey guys

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,599
and he created this stunning

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,940
modification of an NES with with Megaman

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,770
on it it's a homemade oh man themed NES

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,210
I just saw it on the internet yesterday

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,650
I had to get him in here for an

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,600
interview and so let's just jump to

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,250
looking at how beautiful this thing is

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,840
before we even start to talk

13
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,800
so Ryan yeah tell us a little bit about

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,239
this I mean it's just it's just

15
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,970
beautiful how did how did you make it I

16
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,130
mean is that laser-cut on the top there

17
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,670
or what no a lot of people think that I

18
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,330
used lasers or some type of you know

19
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,509
very easy but a professional cutting

20
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:23,030
machine and I took the exact opposite

21
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,970
path I took the very long laborious

22
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,360
everything's done by hand the design the

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,920
outer edge that entire thing was cut

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,720
with a dremel and then all of the edges

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,020
were filed and sanded all by hand and it

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,940
definitely took forever a laser cutter

27
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,679
would've been a lot faster but I wanted

28
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:46,850
to do everything by hand you know I

29
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,090
really wanted to try to make a tribute

30
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,039
piece and art piece to Megaman to the

31
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,170
anniversary that I actually created very

32
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,110
nice very nice and what features have

33
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,640
you added I know there's more than just

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,920
the Megaman on top and the color so tell

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,450
us a little bit about all the stuff that

36
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,580
you've done to this sure okay yeah

37
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,190
obviously the character on the top

38
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,788
backlit the cartridge door has special

39
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,670
decals that I made to celebrate the 25th

40
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,610
anniversary in the Megaman games when

41
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,099
you would pause the game it would show I

42
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,420
think it was in Mega Man 1 it would show

43
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,890
his head and then it would show right

44
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,239
next to that the number of extra lives

45
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:24,980
he had and so this is you know just kind

46
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,890
of a little play off that the power led

47
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,989
has been changed from red to blue to

48
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:32,840
match the color scheme of course and on

49
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,810
the on the side in the back i actually

50
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,140
made custom AV port decals since the

51
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,459
original colors would have looked really

52
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,050
bad with this you know nice blue and

53
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,910
everything so those are now color

54
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,489
matched as well and finally the awesome

55
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:47,360
paint job

56
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,269
i hired my good buddy custom nes guy

57
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:52,580
he's really big on youtube and he's on

58
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,190
facebook etc and he used automotive

59
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,860
paints and clear coat and just painted

60
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,540
the thing exactly how I asked him it's

61
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,940
hard to tell but all of the edges even

62
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,730
have a slight black outline to really

63
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,620
kind of help the colors pop and you know

64
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,650
look just fit the look so oh well that's

65
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,989
that's very nice it's kind of hard to

66
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:13,550
describe just how

67
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,320
perfect this finishes and how straight

68
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,630
these lines are you'll have to see in

69
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,150
the photos it looks really really great

70
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,070
now this isn't your first one and I'm

71
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,200
sure this isn't your last what about

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,360
playing now yeah I definitely learned a

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,760
lot on this one I've done a couple

74
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,320
before this that were much more

75
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,600
simplistic this was the first one where

76
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,960
pixel per pixel I tried to recreate the

77
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,160
original character art and so as I said

78
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,020
I learned a lot and I really want to

79
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,850
continue to celebrate the 25th

80
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,200
anniversary Mega Man this year since

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,330
Capcom is doing it all here I'm going to

82
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,030
as well and so I don't want to divulge

83
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,900
too much information but maybe you'll

84
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,850
see some other Mega Man characters

85
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,260
getting their own custom NES systems and

86
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:06,110

87
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,380
the Megaman games oh very nice now

88
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,430
