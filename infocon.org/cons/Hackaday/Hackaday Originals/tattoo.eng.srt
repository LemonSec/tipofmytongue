1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
okay we are somewhere on the road in New

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,290
Mexico and during the Southwest tour

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,820
we've been hitting different

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,320
hackerspaces at each one I've been

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,650
gathering parts for stuff I have a 3d

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,580
printed jacket a logo piece from a

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,560
little handheld fan that's like the

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,869
battery holder piece some batteries a

9
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:30,960
whole handful of DC motors contact

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,690
switches some guitar strings I'm gonna

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,630
make a tattoo gun like a jailhouse

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,649
tattoo gun

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,430
we'll see if I can make this work as far

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,219
as tools I have my little Leatherman

15
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:50,280
multi-tool scissors stuff electrical

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,809
tape a little bit of wire and a lighter

17
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,580
and pen we'll see if this works

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:02:21,569
[Music]

19
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,349
this is where I'm at so far use the fan

20
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:31,989
kit battery holder a switch DC motor all

21
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:35,260
just taped together and I made this

22
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,049
little what cog that's hopefully going

23
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:41,469
to be a cam shortly I don't know if

24
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,930
that's gonna work I have some guitar

25
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,299
string here that'll go from that down

26
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,980
the barrel of a this pen to make the

27
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,019
needle that actually stabbed you for the

28
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,120
tattoo gun

29
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:45,710
[Music]

30
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:53,489
okay so it's done here it is you can see

31
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,409
I had to replace the cam with a

32
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:56,760
different system the old one wasn't

33
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,209
working but fire it up it goes the

34
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,650
needle goes in and out I don't know if

35
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,639
you can make that out in the video but

36
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,530
the needle is going in and out of that

37
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,180
chamber it actually does work on a

38
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,540
second it actually does work breaks the

39
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,690
skin we sanitize this with some hand

40
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,860
sanitizer and I did my arm here if you

41
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,539
can see that it's kind of bleeding a

42
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:25,860
little bit we'll do a little bit more

43
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,980
here

44
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,739
[Music]

45
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:37,069
you see it start to bleed there again we

46
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,300
used hand sanitizer

47
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,919
you wouldn't actually want to use this

48
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,449
for tattoos they're gonna be really

49
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,219
cruddy quality you want to go to a

50
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:45,319
professional tattoo artist if you want

51
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:49,339
to tattoo but just to show that it could

52
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:52,719
be done that's a hack on the road

53
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,250
