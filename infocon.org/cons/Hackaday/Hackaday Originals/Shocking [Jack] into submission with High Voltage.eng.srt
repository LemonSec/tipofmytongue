1
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,210
this project involves working with high

2
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,550
voltages intentional misuse of voltages

3
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,199
like these could cause injury or death

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,570
do not try this at home hi I'm Jack

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,080
Buffington for hackaday calm recently

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,480
we've been having a rash of techno

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,070
groupies hanging around outside of

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,530
hackaday headquarters somehow our

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,229
location got out and ever since we've

10
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:42,690
had a bunch of people milling about

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,510
we've decided to do something about this

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,710
here to show me what we've come up with

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,979
is hackaday hackaday headquarters head

14
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:55,619
of security Vlad hey Vlad how you doing

15
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:01,689
yeah all right then so Vlad why don't

16
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:03,640
you show show the audience what you're

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,640
wearing here today this is the the

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,200
hackaday stun glove and Vlad's very fond

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,950
of this he came up with this and I'll

20
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,320
just show you the parts of what we have

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,980
here this this is a rubberized glove

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,600
this is to protect your hand from any

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,490
sort of electrical current coming

24
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,220
through it here we have what I

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,870
originally thought were called metal

26
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,020
studs but as a little bit worried about

27
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,850
searching that on the internet but

28
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,310
eventually I found out that they're

29
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,540
called metal spikes or leather spikes

30
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,920
coming off of the leather spikes are

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,950
some well insulated wires that come up

32
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,600
round over his shoulder and down to a

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,060
disposable camera on his hip when it's

34
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,060
action time Vlad just needs to push the

35
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,530
energized button on the flash unit and

36
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,979
he's ready to go so here's the part that

37
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:05,140
I'm not so excited about we're going to

38
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,610
demonstrate the stun glove and you know

39
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,080
you know we want to be cautious about

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,409
this we want to be careful and I'm just

41
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:16,540
going to take a moment here to get ready

42
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,090
and yeah not terribly excited about

43
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:33,370
oh yeah well thank you thank you very

44
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,900
much you can go now ah so that actually

45
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,760
really hurt now we'll take you into

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,530
another room and we'll show you how this

47
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,860
is constructed I have right here the

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,660
stun glove that we used in the other

49
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,860
room and as you can see has two studs on

50
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,799
the outside of it just to give you an

51
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:02,380
example of if you thought that this

52
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,140
maybe wasn't a real thing here's a

53
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,989
regular kitchen knife I'm going to touch

54
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,230
it against both studs here if you can

55
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,579
see that let's go to a closer view so as

56
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,049
you can see it actually does produce

57
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:20,500
some pretty good sparks and I will

58
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,360
attest to the fact that it really does

59
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,980
hurt when you get hit with it it

60
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,420
actually left some marks on my arm

61
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,989
pretty much what we have our leather

62
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:31,690
spikes I screwed up in the other room

63
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,660
and I called a metal spikes but the joke

64
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,980
was supposed to be that I was searching

65
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,859
for leather studs on the Internet until

66
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:40,299
I figured out that they are leather

67
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,150
spikes but you can't help that kind of

68
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,560
stuff when you're nervous about Vlad

69
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,620
being in the room you kind of flubbed

70
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,220
things so let's take some other gloves

71
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,730
and make a stun glove out of them I'm

72
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,590
going to do this with some green gloves

73
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,090
just because I figure they're a little

74
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,970
bit easier to see than hackaday black

75
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,900
these are rubberized gloves and that's

76
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,419
to protect us from the high voltage that

77
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,220
will be contained in the glove

78
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,600
decide which hand you have or you want

79
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,880
to use and we'll take the other glove

80
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,200
we're going to cut a strip out of it

81
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,430
you want to make sure that this strip is

82
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,400
wide enough that the leather spikes

83
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,040
can't ever curl and touch each other

84
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,620
just to keep the corners from ever

85
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,270
rolling up I'm going to round them off

86
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:59,309
now we're going to poke some holes in

87
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:03,489
the material so that we can pass our

88
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:06,189
leather studs or our leather spikes

89
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:08,860
through them here is one of the leather

90
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,839
spikes so you can see we've got a

91
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,469
cone-shaped piece and a screw and they

92
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:17,379
just read together like that going to

93
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:21,209
pass the screw through the material and

94
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:28,029
loosely thread on the spike do the same

95
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:31,719
for the other one so now we have a flap

96
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:34,599
with two spikes on it next I'm going to

97
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:41,349
take my cable strip maybe half inch off

98
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:45,339
of it now we're ready to attach the wire

99
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:48,189
to the metal spike I'm going to take it

100
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:51,249
and lay it on either side of the screw

101
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:54,389
here and I'm going to twist the ends

102
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,149
finally tighten it up well just do that

103
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,439
for the other one and then we'll

104
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,619
continue on alternately what you can do

105
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:06,039
is use a crimp terminal like this one

106
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,069
here I know I have both studs attached

107
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,769
to the wires what I'm going to do now is

108
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:14,709
figure out how long of a wire I need to

109
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,739
get to my hip holster so what I'm going

110
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:19,889
to do is just hold this in my hand

111
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:25,029
measure up my shoulder and down to my

112
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:28,769
hip leaving a little bit extra for

113
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:32,769
wiggle room and we're ready to attach

114
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:36,249
this to the glove what I'm going to do

115
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:40,300
is use a glue called e6000 as you can

116
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,969
see on the close up here e six thousand

117
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,909
is one of my favorite glues I intend to

118
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,829
use it for almost everything for most

119
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:50,199
things it's pretty good glue it takes a

120
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,059
while to set up so don't expect it to

121
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:54,819
harden up quickly like epoxy we're going

122
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,819
to take some e6000 and liberally put it

123
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,729
all over the back of this patch that we

124
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:03,699
made sure to get lots around the wires

125
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,780
help hold them in in

126
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,950
around your edges now place this on to

127
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,389
the glove right above the fingers making

128
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,940
sure to get your your wires oriented as

129
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,350
you would like them because once the

130
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,930
glue dries you're stuck and when I made

131
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,360
the other glove I use some tape to hold

132
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,669
this in place as it was as it was drying

133
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:30,760
so I'll just do that now what I do is

134
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,570
take this tape off after a couple of

135
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,350
hours when the outside glue has dried

136
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,370
now we're going to work on the business

137
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,360
end of the stun glove what I have here

138
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,180
is a disposable camera that i bought

139
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,700
from the drugstore it doesn't have to be

140
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,310
as a disposable camera if you have a

141
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,320
unused regular camera that will work

142
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,270
just as well as long as it has a flash

143
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,680
first thing I'll do is peel off the

144
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,590
labels so they can get it the releases

145
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,640
now we have the releases exposed and as

146
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,850
you can see on the close-up camera

147
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,040
pretty easy I can just take a

148
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,820
screwdriver and pry them so that it

149
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,590
opens up there you go

150
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,980
now the very first thing that we will do

151
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,860
once we get it open is remove this

152
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,800
battery right here it's just a regular

153
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,710
old double a battery and what this does

154
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,050
is keep us from shocking ourselves while

155
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,430
we're working on it just take this film

156
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,920
and get rid of it and we're going to

157
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,250
pull electronics out so now what we have

158
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,620
is we have the exposed circuit board

159
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,850
with the flash we're going to be working

160
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:12,160
with this capacitor right here our leads

161
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,040
will go across the two terminals but

162
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,290
before we go any farther I'm just going

163
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,090
to short across these terminals in case

164
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,760
there is some sort of charge still in

165
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,400
the camera in this case there was not so

166
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,130
now it's safe to work with this so now

167
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,680
I'm going to attach my wire to the leads

168
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,340
of the capacitor this one and this one

169
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,770
right here before I do that I'm going to

170
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,760
use my dremel tool to cut a small hole

171
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,090
for the wires to come out of uh from the

172
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,230
front of the camera

173
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,610
now we're ready to solder I'm going to

174
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,010
put some solder on the leads of the wire

175
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,860
just to get it started I'm going to make

176
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,880
sure it wicks in through everything you

177
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
want to make sure that you have a good

178
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,220
solder joint between the terminals and

179
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,070
your wire just give them a light tug if

180
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,510
you don't they'll pull right back off

181
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,500
now just going to fit everything back

182
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,240
together again I want to make sure to

183
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,250
put our battery back in you'll probably

184
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,079
hear the flash charge when you do that

185
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,540
so beware yep I can hear that charging

186
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,860
it is now live so be careful there we go

187
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,850
and this this done glove assuming the

188
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,920
glue is dry is ready to go there you go

189
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,920
so just so you guys can see here's the

190
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,660
knife I've been using the discharge to

191
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,779
stun gloves to make this sparks it's

192
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:01,480
actually blowing small bits of the knife

193
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,279
away each time i discharged it there is

194
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,100
some power here so be careful so there

195
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,839
you go this is Jack Buffington for

196
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,600
hackaday calm with the stun glove
