00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,779
this is Caleb from hackaday and today

2
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to make a light saber bug

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,810
zapper

4
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,990
I've heard people joke many times but a

5
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,759
light saber would make a perfect bug

6
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,040
zapper maybe the ones from the movies

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,830
would but the common misconception is

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,150
that people think they could use that

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,699
bulb out of one of the household porch

10
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:41,920
bug zappers to make a lightsaber and it

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,379
would work the problem is the bulb

12
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,970
doesn't actually do the zapping it just

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,280
attracts the bugs what does the zapping

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,860
in a bug zapper is a fine mesh of wire

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,690
that electrocutes the bugs whenever they

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,859
come in contact with it here is a toy

17
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,570
that's been on the market for a while I

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,629
found this at Walmart that works on the

19
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:03,670
same exact principle but in a handheld

20
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,810
device what I want to do is gut this and

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,390
combine it with this to give us that bug

22
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,979
zapping light saber

23
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,570
you

24
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,930
you

25
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,320
so as you saw what I did was I removed

26
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,510
the mesh from the racket

27
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,090
I put the fine mesh on the inside then I

28
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,190
used an electrical cord that I cut up as

29
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,020
a spacer so that the outside mesh

30
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,030
wouldn't touch the inside I wired them

31
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,320
back to the controller and just duct

32
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,680
tape this on but now what we have is a

33
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,220
functional button zapping lightsaber it

34
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,500
only took about 20 minutes to make

35
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,830
Oh
