1
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,180
good in the day bad at night these

2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,850
garden gnomes have a surprise in store

3
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,740
today I'm going to take 2 common lawn

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,080
ornaments and combine them to create a

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:38,760
new more evil gnome okay let's get

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,270
started

7
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,420
I have here a box of garden gnomes that

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,239
they caught in China and cryogenically

9
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,210
preserved put them in a box you can get

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,309
them at Harbor Freight for 3 for about 6

11
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:50,930
bucks

12
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,510
and I also have here want to roll off

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,219
the table at the moment I have two solar

14
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,930
lights that I bought from Home Depot and

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,870
they are about 250 apiece and they'll

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,179
make a great power source for our nose

17
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:16,580
we have three gnomes first guy has a

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,330
watering can got this guy he's a little

19
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,080
perv he seems to like doing strange

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,369
things with vegetables this guy

21
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,710
he's holding a hoe but maybe we can

22
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,119
pretend this an axe because that's

23
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,159
slightly creepier all right the first

24
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,530
thing that we're gonna do is we're going

25
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,940
to take a cordless drill we're going to

26
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,729
drill holes into his eyes what I'm going

27
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,890
to use to drill the eyes is a special

28
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,460
type of bit that's designed for masonry

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,670
and for glass and what it has is a

30
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,720
carbide piece here instead of a fluted

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,250
spiral that you would find in most

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:09,720
drills see that end I've found that this

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,630
works great for masonry and not at all

34
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,079
really for glass so for glass what you

35
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,810
really want to use is a diamond bit I'm

36
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,880
going to start by drilling a hole

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,260
through each of the gnomes eyes the key

38
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,609
here is you want to go slowly with not a

39
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:31,440
lot of pressure so that you don't crack

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,190
it make sure that your drill bit doesn't

41
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,430
walk

42
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,650
with not very much pressure

43
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,040
okay so there's one hole and we'll just

44
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,150
do the other now our gnome has holes

45
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,700
where his eyes are the next thing we're

46
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,500
going to do is take a section of wire

47
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,140
and strip the ends off and to do that

48
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,319
I'm going to use a wire stripper tool

49
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,580
what this is is it's sort of like

50
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,680
scissors that has a notch in each blade

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,579
and if you carefully close these you can

52
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,079
strip the insulation off without

53
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,360
actually cutting through the conductor

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,260
inside just put the wire here and just

55
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,720
strip a small section off of each just

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,480
like that now we'll take an LED and cut

57
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,849
the lead short an important thing to

58
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:43,209
know about an LED is that if you see

59
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,579
here on this video just cut the

60
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:48,069
reflection and if I can catch it again

61
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:51,340
here there there's a flat spot next to

62
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,739
one of the LEDs what this is doing is

63
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:57,220
indicating the polarity of the LED you

64
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,169
can also see that the wires on the LED

65
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,840
are one one is longer than the other

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,859
this also indicates the polarity we're

67
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,180
going to pay attention to that when we

68
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,940
attach the wires in our case we're going

69
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,049
to connect the flat lead to the white

70
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:16,750
striped wire now I'm going to take my

71
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,209
soldering iron and apply a little bit of

72
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,510
solder to the leads of the wire the

73
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,680
white wire will go on the flat side so

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,150
I'm just going to add a little bit of

75
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,130
solder to my soldering tip

76
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,530
they're going to touch the wire to the

77
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,440
led very carefully and just bring the

78
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,510
soldering iron down to touch it the way

79
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,570
you want to do this is touch your

80
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,900
soldering iron to the lead itself and

81
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,240
then bring the solder in to touch it

82
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,360
this pre pre heats the conductor that

83
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,690
allows the solder to wick in much better

84
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,970
now I'm going to take the gnome that I'm

85
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,490
going to put this in I'm going to

86
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,190
measure a length of wire that should go

87
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,280
to the eye and out of the bottom of the

88
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,250
gnome just a little bit and cut it off

89
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,250
there so now we have one LED complete

90
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,900
I'm going to do the other LED just the

91
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,050
same way now this is all ready to go now

92
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,540
I'm going to take the gnome I'm going to

93
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,640
thread the wire down through the eye

94
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:35,730
hole out of the feet and with the LED in

95
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,530
position I'm going to take some hot glue

96
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,640
keep it locked into place just apply a

97
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,460
little bit around the eye and we'll do

98
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:55,640
it with the other eye so now we have our

99
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,250
wires coming out of the feet of the

100
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,470
gnome and I'm going to go ahead and

101
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,740
strip the ends of those as well and

102
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,050
attach them together so that the LEDs

103
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,500
are wired in parallel I'll go ahead and

104
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,250
strip them I'm stripping a longer length

105
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,370
here because I want to twist the twist

106
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,250
three wires together and just make it a

107
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,040
lot easier and I'm going to do this with

108
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,780
the additional piece of wire that goes

109
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:29,690
through the solar light as well before I

110
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,700
go doing this I'm going to cut some

111
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,870
sections of shrink tube that I can slip

112
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,910
over the wires to keep them from

113
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,950
touching after I have soldered all this

114
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,340
together so once again I touch I touch

115
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,100
my soldering iron to the wires and bring

116
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,700
the solder down and let it wick in there

117
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,220
we go we have it soldered now I'm just

118
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,400
going to take and fold these over like

119
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,130
this slip the heat shrink tubing over

120
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,900
top of all that now there heat shrink

121
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,600
tubing is in place I'm going to shrink

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,960
it with a lighter and what you don't

123
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,060
want to do is hold your lighter there in

124
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,000
place for a long time and really cook

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,160
the heat shrink tubing you just want to

126
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,770
move it around let it shrink when you

127
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,390
see that it's shrunk in a certain

128
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,130
section it's time to move on

129
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,720
there we go now the top side won't have

130
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,030
been shrunk yet so I'll just hit that as

131
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:42,800
well great and we'll do the other one

132
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,620
there we go now we're going to move on

133
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,490
to our solar light the first thing that

134
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,360
we need to do is drill a hole in the

135
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,700
clear part so that we can get the wire

136
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:07,680
out of out of the solar light going to

137
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,130
go ahead and slip the wire through this

138
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,110
hole now now I'm going to take the

139
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,980
remainder of my solar light and take it

140
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:23,930
apart there you have it there's the

141
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,120
battery is in here and we have one small

142
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,010
circuit board it doesn't really have all

143
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,560
that much on it the solar cells are here

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,110
I have four solar cells each solar cell

145
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,049
produces about 0.5 volts so altogether

146
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,409
this is producing about 2 volts right

147
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,450
here in the center is a cadmium sulfide

148
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,090
cell and what this is is a

149
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,060
light-sensitive resistor in case we're

150
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,120
going to remove the circuit board you

151
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,710
want to be careful that you don't wiggle

152
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,340
the wires too much otherwise they will

153
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,240
break off from the circuit board now I

154
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,050
have the LED exposed now I could leave

155
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,380
the LED in here but will get longer

156
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,070
runtime if I take it out what I'm going

157
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,380
to do is just heat both leads up at the

158
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,440
same time and get them red-hot and then

159
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,730
I should be able to just wiggle it out

160
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,180
of there with my soldering iron now I'm

161
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,750
going to quickly strip

162
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,720
the end of the wire that I just slipped

163
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:37,910
through the solar lights enclosure I'm

164
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,719
going to tin it

165
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:46,359
I'm going to apply a little solder to

166
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:49,899
the end of it one more thing you need to

167
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:55,389
drill a little hole through here so that

168
00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:00,269
can sneak the wire through there as well

169
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,049
just connecting to the board

170
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:20,160
so now I'll just reattach the screws

171
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:23,740
again making sure to not wiggle the

172
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,569
wires too much because otherwise they

173
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:32,130
might break and we'll reattach this to

174
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,790
the top of the solar light but as you

175
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,339
can see here we've now have a garden

176
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,980
gnome one solar light and when it loses

177
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:48,220
its light eyes light up red one

178
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,110
interesting suggestion that came from

179
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,870
our writer Mike Nathan was that you

180
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,180
could make the gnomes so that they are

181
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,000
only evil when somebody gets close to

182
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,420
him by having a passive infrared sensor

183
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,329
so whenever they detect motion the eyes

184
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:07,930
come on and when it stops they're off so

185
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,720
from a distance it doesn't seem evil but

186
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,029
get close and you make them angry so

187
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:14,980
there you go this is Jack Buffington for

188
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,350
hackaday comm with a simple project that

189
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,360
you can do in an evening it takes a good

190
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,199
gnome and turns it pure evil
