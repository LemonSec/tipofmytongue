00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
this is Caleb with hackaday as soon as I

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,370
saw the Thor movie I knew I needed that

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,500
hammer but hey this is hackaday right I

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,540
can't just have the same crappy plastic

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,830
hammer as everybody else

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,349
I mean Thor's hammer Mjolnir can summon

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,790
lightning and you know what

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,140
so can mine 80,000 volts worth

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,550
when I decided to do this project

10
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,430
I contacted Stacy Alam she makes Tesla

11
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,050
coils and donates them to educational

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,640
groups she's really cool you got to

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,620
check out her channel when I asked her

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,600
to do was to make me a tiny Tesla coil

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,190
that could fit in the head of my hammer

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,470
she did it worked out great as you can

17
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,000
see works pretty well when I got it I

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,920
built the hammer around it it's a foam

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,070
head so it's fairly light PVC handle

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,810
with some nice leather woven around it

21
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,880
and the battery at the bottom that can

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,280
pop out to be recharged it's a pretty

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,550
fun toy and it turns heads everywhere I

24
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,729
go I'd love to have more ideas of cool

25
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:22,869
stuff I could build so be sure to

26
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:24,400
comment and let me know if you have any

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,590
also be sure to subscribe for more hacks

28
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,400
just like this

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,030
but you know what

30
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:50,020
so can my hammer 80,000 volts
