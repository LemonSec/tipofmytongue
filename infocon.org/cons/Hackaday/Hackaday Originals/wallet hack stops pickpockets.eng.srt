2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,880
here's a real quick act to make sure you

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,860
are never the victim of a pickpocket

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,639
it's a wallet alarm let alarm there goes

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,949
off when your wallet is removed from

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,869
your pocket I'm going to show you how to

7
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,449
make this it's really quick and easy to

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,369
do this hack you're going to need a

9
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,929
wallet in desperate need of cleaning a

10
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,369
magnetic alarm I had these sitting

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,480
around from having kids in the house

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,649
they just use a magnet and a reed switch

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,320
and a strong magnet I'm going to start

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,879
by opening this up and checking app see

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:45,510
what I've got

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,969
here's where the batteries go here's the

17
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,460
magnetic reed switch the buzzers here

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,050
the container is very nice for it it

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,699
amplifies it to be really loud so I'm

20
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,079
going to try to salvage that with and

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,870
remove as much of the case as possible

22
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,430
I'm probably also going to have to move

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,640
this reed switch so that it'll be at the

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,438
bottom of my pocket where it's easiest

25
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,140
to put a magnet and place the wallet

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,850
back on top of it here's the final

27
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,280
product hot glued into my wallet as you

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,200
can see I left the piece where the

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,520
batteries are intact

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,350
I left the buzzer intact but moved it

31
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,270
sideways because that reduced some of

32
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,270
the width and then I simply added wires

33
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,250
to extend out and place the magnetic

34
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,869
switch at the spine of my wallet so you

35
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,340
can see here to the very spine this

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,380
allows the switch to be at the edge so

37
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,119
that I can flick it on and off with my

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,040
finger very easily in my pocket looks

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,259
fairly thick but if you compare it to

40
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,390
the stack of stuff that I cleaned out of

41
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,340
my wallet that really needed to come out

42
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,340
it's about the same maybe even thinner

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,280
so I don't even notice it in my pocket

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,700
after that you're going to need a strong

45
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,439
magnet that you can hot glue to a safety

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,200
pin and stick in your pocket or in your

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,630
purse and that will disable the alarm

48
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,119
whenever you put the item back in your

49
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,420
pocket

50
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,180

51
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:12,959
the final product works pretty well you

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,239
might be asking yourself why I insisted

53
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,160
on shoving all of that into the wallet

54
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,720
instead of letting the wallet be thin

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,940
and putting it in my pocket or in a

56
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,260
purse or something like that

57
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,300
and the reason is that I wanted the

58
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,640
wallet itself to make the noise so that

59
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,290
if a pickpocket pulled it out of your

60
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,420
pocket they'd want to drop it

61
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,040
immediately and get out of there they

62
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,750
wouldn't want to hold on to it it would

63
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,300
shock them and hopefully be successful
