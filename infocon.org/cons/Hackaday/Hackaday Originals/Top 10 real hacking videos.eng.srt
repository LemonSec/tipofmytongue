1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,460
this is Caleb with hackaday and in this

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,710
video we are going to be sharing the top

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,980
10 best hacking videos now these can be

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,309
documentaries TV or movie that show what

5
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,429
hacking really is we pose the question

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:15,960
to our community and these are the

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,779
answers we came out with number 10 the

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,439
KGB the computer and me made in 1990

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,300
this is a true story about Clifford

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,400
Stoll who found a hacker in his system

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,099
and tracked him back to Germany this is

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,529
a made-for-tv movie so it is really kind

13
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,370
of cheesy to watch but it's true it's

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,500
all true it's an amazing story and it's

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,739
really interesting number 9 is BBS the

16
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,710
documentary Jason Scott takes us through

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,899
eight episodes discussing the rise and

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,239
fall of BBS systems sprinkled in there

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,640
are numerous accounts of interesting

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,530
aspects of hacking a number 8 is

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,870
unauthorized access released in 1994

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,270
this documentary shows all kinds of

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,879
hacking from lock-picking to dumpster

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,790
diving computer hacking is you would

25
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,619
guess as well it's a great documentary

26
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,490
and fun to watch too number 7 we've

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,950
included the show the secret life of

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,439
machines while not explicitly about

29
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,659
hacking you'll learn more about hacking

30
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,280
watching this show than you would many

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,229
other sources with the word hack in them

32
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,320
it details how machines work in

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,240
different ways and they even recreate

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,740
the functions of machines with some

35
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,750
improvised materials such as sprinkling

36
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,490
magnetic powder on some scotch tape to

37
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,500
make magnetic tape just like in your

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,570
tape cassette player if you recall what

39
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,640
those were very interesting show and

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,750
really a great resource for a hacker at

46
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,680
it they always have to hack something

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,320

it's a blast to watch it's a lot of fun

62

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,960
as well the number four we have the

64
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,380
documentary triumph of the Nerds it was

65
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,540
released in 1996 and covers the history

66
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,610
of computers how it started from hackers

67
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,470
and their garages and at universities

68
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,750
and now well they run the world

69
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,370
computers are everywhere everything we

70
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,200
do is connected to a computer and those

71
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,450
nerds or hackers are now some of the

72
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,030
most powerful and richest people on the

73
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,390
planet number three is the secret

74
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,370
history of hacking this documentary

75
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,890
covers people like John Draper kevin

76
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,680
Mitnick the woz that are most

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,470
influential in the early hacking scene

78
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,660
in america the the kind of hacking that

79
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,800
we think of where people are breaking

80
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,080
into computer systems or tricking phone

81
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,420
systems it's a must watch if you want to

82
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,560
know what you're talking about whenever

83
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,700
it comes to hacking and hacking culture

84
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,200
number two we have hacks by Christine

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,870
Bader released in 1997 this is an

86
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,269
excellent documentary that shows how

87
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:38,220
hacking isn't just about one thing or

88
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,170
two things hacking covers so many

89
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,790
different areas it's almost impossible

90
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,420
to define a number one we have hackers

91
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,550
are people too

92
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,780
this video was released the most

93
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,300
recently in 2008 and I think it does an

94
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,250
amazing job of showing what the hacker

95
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,739
community is really like it may not be

96
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,810
as educational as the others but since

97
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,450
it is the most recent it really really

98
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,430
shows what's going on now in the hacker

99
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,660
community the friendships the

100
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,390
experiences at the cons tons of

101
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,830
interviews with people that are in the

102
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,660
hacking community this is really a great

103
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,930
one and I recommend it to anybody

104
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,149
one thing that I found incredibly

105
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,079
interesting was the fact that the one

106
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,418
produced in 2008 was the most gripping

107
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,090
for me because it was the most relevant

108
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,560
this got me thinking and I have to say I

109
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,389
am so excited to see

110
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:28,650
it's going to happen in the next 10 to

111
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,680
15 years what the documentaries my

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,330
children are going to be watching that

113
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,270
have things like virtual reality and 3d

114
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,729
printing and and all the projects coming

115
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,669
out of crowdfunding there's a lot of

116
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:43,439
very exciting stuff going on right now

117
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,240
that I think we'll be hearing about in

118
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,539
the future as huge steps in hacker

119
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,150
culture I know we missed some pretty

120
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,770
good ones so be sure to leave me a

121
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,199
comment letting me know what

122
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,430
documentaries movies or TV shows you

123
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,830
think are a must watch for anyone

124
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,628
wanting to learn what hacking really is
