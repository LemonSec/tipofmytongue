1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,490
this is Caleb with hackaday now the

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,200
project I'm about to show you is easily

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,700
one of the coolest ones I've been able

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,039
to do unfortunately it was also one of

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,300
the most frustrating because I was

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,849
unable to capture the effect on video

7
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,370
I'll tell you more about that later what

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,859
I built this time was a living night

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,590
light out of glowing algae

10
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,730
bioluminescent dinoflagellates occur

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,560
naturally in the ocean and glow

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,269
extremely bright they look like a blue

13
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,430
or green glow stick sometimes there's so

14
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,410
many of them an entire shoreline will

15
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,590
glow bright blue it's wild it's crazy to

16
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,170
see and I wanted a piece of that in my

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,219
home this was my idea for how the lamp

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,649
would look I got this Klein bottle it's

19
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,000
really cool you have to check out the

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,520
link for these it's a continuous surface

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,510
that theoretically has no volume of

22
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,629
course you can fill it up with stuff and

23
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:54,300
I have 3d printed a custom stand for it

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,789
let's hold it up make sure it doesn't

25
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:57,620
get knocked over

26
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,070
now the algae only illuminates whenever

27
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,319
it's agitated so I figured I would take

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,619
the idea of a stirrer that you would use

29
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,689
in chemistry and apply this to the Klein

30
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,409
bottle to do this I've made the lower

31
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,200
part of the base here I threw a tiny

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,750
servo in there which not sure if you can

33
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,979
see that and I printed out this wheel

34
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,240
with two magnets on it I'm going to drop

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,460
a BB into the Klein bottle and we will

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,640
move that BB around with the servo to

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,299
agitate the algae

38
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:49,220
now I have a suspicion that this and the

39
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,920
BB as you saw aren't going to be strong

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,090
enough to really get a good light going

41
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,300
so as a backup I've taken this stolen

42
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,280
this from my children it creates a

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,440
tornado in here with a little um you

44
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,240
know like a DC motor with a paddle on

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,550
the end of it extremely simple but I

46
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,930
actually think this is going to end up

47
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,660
being more effective this is just so

48
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,640
much prettier though so we'll give it a

49
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,300
try okay I've been playing with this for

50
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,980
a couple days now and this stuff is

51
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,980
really really cool it looks just like a

52
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,160
glow stick blue glow stick whenever you

53
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,850
shake it up it's truly beautiful this

54
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,360
container the BB I was using just swirl

55
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,610
it around just didn't agitate it enough

56
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,310
to really get it glowing you could kind

57
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,080
of see a swirl on the bottom but it just

58
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,320
wasn't enough to really get it go this

59
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,460
one worked fantastic except it has a

60
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,520
leak so in between each time I wanted to

61
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,590
try to film I had to put it back in

62
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,030
these containers that it came in which

63
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,680
aren't as pretty but they do the job

64
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,050
that brings me to the next problem I had

65
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,420
I couldn't film it the camera that I'm

66
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,880
using right now to talk into just

67
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,410
wouldn't pick it up it was too dark in

68
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,840
the room and the algae doesn't glow

69
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,300
quite bright enough to pick up on the

70
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,450
camera and this camera wouldn't pick it

71
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,839
up either and neither would my

72
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,380
point-and-shoot so I borrowed this guy

73
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,840
and it picked up it a little bit but I

74
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,480
couldn't quite get the exposure how I

75
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,400
needed it to show off it was still

76
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,060
pretty blurry

77
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,930
until finally I borrowed this one which

78
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,950
seems to work okay

79
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,340
I've had this in place a few weeks now

80
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,140
and I can easily say this is one of the

81
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,800
coolest things I have ever seen the

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,650
algae pulses and lights up with every

83
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,660
step I take across the room coming to my

84
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,430
side of the bed just the vibrations of

85
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,290
my feet hitting the floor enough to

86
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,320
agitate it I can lay here and reach up

87
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,990
and give it a few taps and it lights up

88
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,750
for 30 seconds pretty bright and then

89
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,570
after that individual algae particles

90
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,520
will light up like fireflies in the mix

91
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,190
in here for easily a minute afterwards

92
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,430
it's just so freakin beautiful I can't

93
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,620
believe it I've bought some microalgae

94
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,360
food and I plan on keeping this alive as

95
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,120
long as possible be sure to leave a

96
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,620
comment letting me know of any other

97
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,390
cool ideas you might have that I could

98
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,250
try with this stuff and also subscribe
