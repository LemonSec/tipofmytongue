1
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,190
this is the Taser drone a standard

2
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,579
parrot ar.drone quadcopter that's been

3
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,940
modified to pack a punch to make the

4
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,010
Taser drone what we did was we took the

5
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,239
indoor hold a var drone we've lined the

6
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,899
edges with aluminum foil tape as you can

7
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:00,760
see here there are two of them if you

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,790
bridge those you get shocked by the

9
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,430
flash circuit from a disposable camera

10
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,050
they'll be stuffed inside the shocks

11
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,060
pretty unpleasant I'll show you how it

12
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,670
works it'll make a jump and it'll

13
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,020
certainly make you try to get away from

14
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,399
the drone when you see it coming
