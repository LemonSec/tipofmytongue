00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
this is Caleb with hackaday and today

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,250
I'm really excited to show you my giant

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,980
fire-breathing purr on a planet I love

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,519
this thing

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,349
not only because it's over six feet tall

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,540
and a little bit ridiculous like myself

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,150
but it breathes fire I've made several

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,500
fire systems for it

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,449
only two have survived and not become

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,359
flaming balls of failure so let's jump

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,580
to it let's see some fire well the

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,130
outdoor flame system is using compressed

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,710
air and creamer to make flames that go

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:35,760
six to ten feet in the air the indoor

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,920
flame system uses you tane in a can and

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,980
a servo for actuated of course I call it

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,300
into orbit at sport room that has a

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,309
20-foot ceiling so you wouldn't really

19
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:50,250
want to use these in your house to build

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,050
it I first started by building a frame

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,459
out of this blue foam board you see

22
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,440
after that I used expanding foam to

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,039
create the the fleshed-out kind of shape

24
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,250
i sculpted it with a razor and then

25
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,720
added a little more expanding foam to

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,490
give the lips that crazy look that I

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,210
like a little bit of spray paint

28
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,080
finishes the job

29
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,070
and there you have it that's the final

30
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,700
plant more details on how I constructed

31
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,990
this and how I made all the flame

32
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,150
systems and the ones that failed as well

33
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,640
