1
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:40,379
right up<font color="#CCCCCC"> next is Alvaro he's gonna be</font>

2
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,710
talking about lasers and how to shoot

3
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:47,849
them at things as part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEF CON</font>

4
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:49,230
laser competition he also reverse

5
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,039
engineers drones he actually submitted

6
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,199
to talks and well he's keeping cutting

7
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,550
out don't they he's submitted to talks

8
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,320
the other one about<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse engineering</font>

9
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,930
drones which you can also see an

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,290
hackaday<font color="#CCCCCC"> i oh that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cool he</font>

11
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,850
reverse engineered the protocol and uh

12
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:10,408
slaves them now and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get</font>

13
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,530
those little tiny<font color="#E5E5E5"> $20 ones he also does</font>

14
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,909
the laser<font color="#CCCCCC"> turret stuff and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think I've</font>

15
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,720
killed enough time for Alvaro welcome

16
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,720
Alvaro to the stage

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:28,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font>

18
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh backwards just do that sorry all</font>

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:45,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">right sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the wrong spot</font>

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:45,810
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do it I'll play sorry</font>

21
00:01:47,460 --> 00:02:05,530
keynote huh yeah are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing better</font>

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:02:09,190
thank you that I worse though hello i'm

23
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,320
alvaro<font color="#CCCCCC"> i make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a robot sometimes so um</font>

24
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,910
talk today's about some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

25
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,700
learned making later laser shooting

26
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,560
robots why at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're shooting</font>

27
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,970
robots to you shouldn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to ask</font>

28
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:25,269
but because they're awesome um this all

29
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,640
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2006 right out of high school I</font>

30
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:29,560
found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> about def con first of all and</font>

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,738
then I found out Def Con has this robot

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,500
competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON bots which back then</font>

33
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:38,530
was autonomous robot that shoots bb's

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,769
add these targets and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had no idea</font>

35
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">about robotics or computer vision or</font>

36
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:49,090
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> because like I'll try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it why</font>

37
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:52,360
not so so I went that happened 2006 come

38
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,430
fast forward 2014 they brought it back

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,140
that the Sun was with lasers so the

40
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,970
rules of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Def Con</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bots competition is</font>

41
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,000
filled an autonomous robot with a name

42
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">and mechanism and a laser and softer to</font>

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,040
accurately aim and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shoot at moving</font>

44
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,410
eliminate targets so these were little

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,179
ping-pong balls on a train track that

46
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:14,109
we're moving around and then the robot

47
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,190
had to find them and shoot them um so I

48
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,140
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yesterday but another</font>

49
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,140
disclaimer i<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have no idea what I'm</font>

50
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:27,779
doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all stuff I've learned and</font>

51
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:29,980
yeah so I started what service you know

52
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,620
like okay I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move webcam and a</font>

53
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,780
laser have some hobby servos this was

54
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,140
cut with balsa wood with a knife

55
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,640
um yeah it my mechanical I'm an

56
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,220
electrical engineer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I write code for</font>

57
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,010
living so<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of making these projects</font>

58
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,600
was to learn about mechanical things

59
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,160
which I know nothing about and computer

60
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,109
vision which also knew nothing about so

61
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,130
this is more of a learning project so

62
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:59,080
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you a webcam with a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

63
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:01,859
on top but kind of moved so yeah service

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,170
are really easy to use but when you

65
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">targets about 10 meters away a little</font>

66
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,730
bit of movement it's going to be half a

67
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,920
meter and you can't really shoot things

68
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:16,810
that way so here's some of my early

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,659
concepts I was like okay could i use

70
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,430
gears could I use like pulleys I'm doing

71
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,010
some math trying to figure out if the

72
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,350
targets 10 meters away a stepper motor

73
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,729
1.8 degree that's gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 30</font>

74
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,310
centimeters it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> good enough so i</font>

75
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:31,599
need to do some reduction well then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

76
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,940
found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> about laser cutters and I'm</font>

77
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,910
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoo tech</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shop has laser cutters</font>

78
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,840
let me see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can use this to my</font>

79
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,540
advantage so here I am testing cutting

80
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,710
the stepper motor mounts here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

81
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:49,810
more testing one thing I learned was try

82
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,049
it out on cardboard first with laser

83
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,050
cutter because you run out of material

84
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,919
pretty quick when you're making mistakes

85
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:06,990
so yeah be careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

86
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:11,620
pulley system<font color="#E5E5E5"> here of pulley and the</font>

87
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:14,710
camera so these were more complicated i

88
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:17,380
thought i bought these different sizes

89
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:21,099
and i had these little drive belts but

90
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:24,100
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't fit so I had to</font>

91
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:27,160
cut the belt and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then super glue it back</font>

92
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,800
together to size instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,210
move<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around and I found out</font>

94
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can super google the belts and I</font>

95
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,460
mostly work I'll stay together for long

96
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,000
enough until the competition then they

97
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:42,310
break but you just bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> super glue so</font>

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,560
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I learned laser cutting then I</font>

99
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,060
said oh let me start doing some CAD 2d

100
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,650
CAD

101
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:51,830
um forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> a witch cat program in use but</font>

102
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,570
okay let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me start making a little more</font>

103
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,969
complicated things laser cutting is

104
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,469
awesome lesson learned so you probably

105
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't even tell which when I made it by</font>

106
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:05,930
hand and which was the laser cutter um

107
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:09,990
but yeah this was the laser cutter one

108
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:12,389
so just learning of here it is with

109
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,480
stepper motors so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have I found this</font>

110
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:17,880
super cute little tiny stepper motor and

111
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,350
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bigger one and I found out that</font>

112
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of these can't even lift their own</font>

113
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,470
weight so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can move one direction</font>

114
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,960
and then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay up there so read a</font>

115
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,340
sign again I didn't calculate you how

116
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,169
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> torque the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing hat or anything</font>

117
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,840
until I go just plug it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work no</font>

118
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:36,930
doesn't do that so think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much</font>

119
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,049
the thing with otherwise it probably

120
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,639
won't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so belts were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

121
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,100
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try on gears I hear all these</font>

122
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,229
great things about gears um they'll hold

123
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,950
things up and everything but they're

124
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:52,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">really expensive but there's programs</font>

125
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:56,039
out there with open oh no what's called

126
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:58,020
a openscad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess s CAD there's some</font>

127
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,599
scripts it'll make the gears for you

128
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,280
just give it a few parameters and you

129
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,060
can release<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company which is really</font>

130
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,400
cool so here's some more you have your

131
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,270
stepper motors and some gears just

132
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,130
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> them out now once i move into</font>

133
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,219
gears there's no more just winging it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

134
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,300
had to actually measure where things

135
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,100
you're gonna be otherwise it's not going

136
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,800
to fit if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll jam</font>

137
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,389
if they're too far away this is not

138
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,510
great so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had to do some math</font>

139
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:31,139
and well too bad so here's the first

140
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:32,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">prototype with full with just gears and</font>

141
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,510
actually work<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty well there was some</font>

142
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,270
backlash um and again when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have the</font>

143
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,680
1.8 degree micro or steps it was a

144
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">little too much i tried microstepping</font>

145
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,130
which is great but they're not

146
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,810
guaranteed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen so if you're trying</font>

147
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,350
to keep absolute positioning and you

148
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:52,800
have no feedback yeah it's it's not the

149
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:55,800
best but the mechanics were working<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

150
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,740
all right next next step let me try to

151
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,949
do some 3d modeling um

152
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,949
so yeah I tried it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this was</font>

153
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:12,060
autodesk fusion I i<font color="#CCCCCC"> switched to use</font>

154
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:16,400
gearmotors so these are like 1000 to 1

155
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:19,520
or 500 to 10 reduction and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have toy</font>

156
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,190
wheels so now it's a friction drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

157
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,210
had that problem earlier with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> motor</font>

158
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:30,120
not being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold up itself so</font>

159
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:33,718
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a little some ball</font>

160
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,310
bearings in this little table so most of

161
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,630
the way it's supported there and then I

162
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">just have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to move a side by side and</font>

163
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:43,049
then this other motor here just moves

164
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:46,560
the holder for the camera again lace

165
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:49,079
your cutting great yay I have to keep

166
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,800
the laser in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the camera mounted together</font>

167
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,870
the first generation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

168
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,339
the targets somewhere I can move<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

169
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,529
camera to point towards it and I know

170
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:01,560
the laser is hitting a certain pixel

171
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:02,790
position so I sasa picked the laser and

172
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,390
the camera don't move relative to each

173
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,589
other it's very easy to hit targets

174
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,899
unfortunately a lot of these webcams are

175
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,820
terrible for staying in one place the

176
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,600
best one I found had a tripod mount but

177
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,010
the front still moved so a sauce that

178
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,180
didn't move too much it was fine but

179
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,540
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> great for precision</font>

180
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:24,660
precision work so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my next</font>

181
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,209
generation I have wheels and everything

182
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,670
I know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see there's a very big big</font>

183
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:31,709
flaw in my plan here I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

184
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,920
anything going down the middle very

185
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:37,020
stable so whenever this guy moves it

186
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,849
just pushes this right<font color="#CCCCCC"> out it just falls</font>

187
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:45,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">right out so not very good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then here's</font>

188
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:47,790
your motor oh yeah limit switches so

189
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,189
hopefully you have open loop control and

190
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,819
you have cables in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back it'll just</font>

191
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:57,410
keep going tangled self up and break

192
00:09:52,820 --> 00:10:00,240
yeah it's bad so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to add little</font>

193
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:02,670
push buttons here to basically detect

194
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,040
why nots move too far and it needs to

195
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,930
stop weeks i had a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times for just</font>

196
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,839
kept spinning except there's a webcam

197
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:13,310
there so it gets expensive real quick um

198
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,500
next generations like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

199
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:20,500
slipping off so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me put more wheels</font>

200
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:23,300
around it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have pieces of the</font>

201
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:26,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">wood big enough so I had to make them to</font>

202
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:33,380
several smaller pieces glue and epoxy

203
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:35,120
are your friend they you have your parts

204
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,150
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite fit just put more glue more</font>

205
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,040
epoxy and it usually ends up working out

206
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:48,430
so here's two generations of the thing

207
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:51,530
yeah I made two because things break so

208
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,969
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is what I actually took to</font>

209
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:56,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> competition so I got a smaller</font>

210
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:58,070
webcam because back then my computer

211
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">vision skills were worse than they are</font>

212
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's already saying something</font>

213
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,650
so we got a smaller webcam less pixels

214
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:09,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I could process them faster and that</font>

215
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:12,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually became a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem oh you had so</font>

216
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,660
tolerances I don't know if you notice

217
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,480
there's little shrimps of paper all

218
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:20,540
around here I laser cut this all in<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

219
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,550
piece so the pieces fit together great

220
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,959
but there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of play in</font>

221
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,939
between and you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

222
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,980
friction to hold something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in place and</font>

223
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:32,060
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> movement it just kind</font>

224
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,680
of ruins your day so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to put pieces</font>

225
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,479
of paper there to kind of hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

226
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,280
place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's actually rubber bands</font>

227
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:42,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">going around the the main circle in the</font>

228
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,990
middle because the laser the laser

229
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,670
cutter leaves a lot of little dust and

230
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:50,900
we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do friction and guess thus it</font>

231
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:54,050
just slips and then again that bed so

232
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,790
yeah this was the Deaf<font color="#CCCCCC"> khambhat 2014 we</font>

233
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,880
got first place so we got a quadcopter

234
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,349
out of it so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind of fun fast</font>

235
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,160
forward to<font color="#CCCCCC"> last summer or this summer</font>

236
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:06,890
yeah 2015 I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> improve things so</font>

237
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,219
it was fun last year but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn</font>

238
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:12,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">something new and the motor is they work</font>

239
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,980
great but they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> really slow so what's</font>

240
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,800
faster than motors mirrors and

241
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,750
galvanometers with this system I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

242
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,010
point a laser wherever I want and like

243
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,769
sub-millisecond which is super cool and

244
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a lot</font>

245
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:29,129
on you could do I don't know if you guys

246
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:31,979
saw Theresa hackaday logo we projected

247
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:36,959
up there yesterday that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was me playing</font>

248
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:39,989
around with stuff problem is mounting

249
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,559
optics is not easy right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now this is a</font>

250
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:45,660
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my first step at home I just</font>

251
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,939
kind of hold it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hope for</font>

252
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:51,238
the best the webcam was on a tripod over

253
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:53,519
there I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about opening though</font>

254
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:57,089
and open beam is awesome you just get

255
00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:00,389
this extruded aluminum parts and you

256
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:04,709
it's great<font color="#CCCCCC"> I made my prototyping so much</font>

257
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:06,989
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my cad by hand</font>

258
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:09,540
because it was easier than trying to it

259
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:12,119
in software and I had to make a little

260
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,589
amount because I have these<font color="#CCCCCC"> Galvan</font>

261
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:15,569
motors which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> from ebay by the way</font>

262
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:18,959
you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole acer projecting</font>

263
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:21,329
system for about 80 bucks on ebay and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

264
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:26,160
comes with the motors the driver is

265
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:30,299
pretty cool so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I made my precision mount</font>

266
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:34,019
with a more wood I basically printed

267
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:35,129
this out to size I taped it on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

268
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,649
piece of wood and then I drilled through

269
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:40,549
it and then cut it which is because I

270
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:42,689
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a laser cutter at the time</font>

271
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:44,459
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of what it ended up</font>

272
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:49,219
looking like you have your your mirrors

273
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:53,609
here you later these are the two galvo

274
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:55,589
drivers and the webcam oh yeah open

275
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,170
beams awesome already<font color="#E5E5E5"> said that so here</font>

276
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,459
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see these come with a kit you</font>

277
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically give them a differential</font>

278
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:04,229
voltage and you can move<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Maris</font>

279
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,869
wherever you want so the main difference

280
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,649
from this<font color="#CCCCCC"> system and the previous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font>

281
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:12,899
now the camera the laser are not aligned

282
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:15,179
at all the camera does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> move the</font>

283
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,649
laser does so the math is completely

284
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,679
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I would move the camera</font>

285
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:21,419
and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center the target now I know</font>

286
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">where the target is and I have to hit</font>

287
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the laser with it which was a whole</font>

288
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:27,569
other problem I had to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with this</font>

289
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:30,989
calibration routine to get pixel values

290
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:32,729
and laser positions together but I if I

291
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:34,949
have time I'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but i probably</font>

292
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,689
don't you can ask me about it later<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

293
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:38,669
tried different designs like a vertical

294
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:40,040
mount at laser and just to make a

295
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:43,410
compact

296
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:47,189
this is my test<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up at home I didn't</font>

297
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,839
know how big<font color="#CCCCCC"> the competition area was</font>

298
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:53,459
going to be so I just used<font color="#E5E5E5"> my living</font>

299
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,989
room here it is I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

300
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,118
picture because you can see the green

301
00:14:54,989 --> 00:15:00,420
laser beam actually shooting I had some

302
00:14:57,119 --> 00:15:01,860
targets as a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun so when building</font>

303
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,469
robots test them out especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

304
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,699
your competition you test them a lot

305
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,009
before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> competition a lot of people</font>

306
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:13,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">had trouble they showed up and then it</font>

307
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:16,739
didn't work you news really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad so this</font>

308
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,660
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the brains of my system stm32</font>

309
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:22,139
discovery board great for prototype

310
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">prototyping i use it has two dax so i</font>

311
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:30,480
can use the dax I to control<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the two</font>

312
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:32,399
mirrors I made oh oh yeah so I'll go

313
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,850
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that I had to make this forward</font>

314
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,970
to go from the analog 03 volts coming

315
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:41,339
out of the DAC on the stm32 and make

316
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:44,220
into a plus or minus or<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

317
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,660
differential voltage 0 to 15 volts for

318
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,220
the gala controller so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to make</font>

319
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,929
this little bored this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> second</font>

320
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,779
generation because the first I did all

321
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:53,790
the math I did my op amp calculation i

322
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:58,139
put the resistors in and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was not</font>

323
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:59,669
quite right so use potentiometers don't

324
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:03,029
just you've put the resistors on your

325
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:06,149
prototyping because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to mess around</font>

326
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:08,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it a lot because it's ebay parts</font>

327
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:12,059
they're cheap they're not as advertised

328
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:14,669
so yeah so you have your microcontroller

329
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:16,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">i just wrote some code to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a USB</font>

330
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:18,149
serial terminal and I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

331
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:21,119
x<font color="#E5E5E5"> and y position and then it would go</font>

332
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:26,040
that direction so it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

333
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:27,899
use open beam as well it packs you can

334
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,980
take it apart<font color="#E5E5E5"> in pieces thank you to</font>

335
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:33,869
evil mad scientist for the awesome boxes

336
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:37,439
I'd had to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vegas and an airplane</font>

337
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:40,110
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> laser shooting robots which is</font>

338
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:41,488
complicated but<font color="#E5E5E5"> TSA doesn't always care</font>

339
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,259
I was freaking out but they didn't even

340
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:46,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">open my bag is I was kind of sad I</font>

341
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:50,309
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show them some robots but you</font>

342
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,880
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so this is it a hotel in Vegas</font>

343
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:55,130
once we got there

344
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,480
always breaks Paris like i said before

345
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,660
you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or three of</font>

346
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,540
everything from experience things break

347
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,730
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single time so yeah bring spares</font>

348
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,260
oh I do have a picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

349
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,410
competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is this year</font>

350
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,180
you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> here are the little targets</font>

351
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,720
and there's a train track and they're

352
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,920
moving around this year you didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

353
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,350
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> target with the laser</font>

354
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,329
because that's easy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to hit the</font>

355
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:23,849
target<font color="#CCCCCC"> the laser and then send serial</font>

356
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:26,310
data over the laser at 9600 baud with

357
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:29,159
your ID that way they knew hit hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

358
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:33,179
targets unfortunately I didn't test that

359
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:36,480
part that well and my laser was

360
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,040
modulating but for some reason I still

361
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,050
haven't figured out why things to do my

362
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,750
power supply<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I started transferring</font>

363
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:46,110
the data it would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> brown out and the</font>

364
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,910
targets were in detecting the hits and

365
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,490
this was working<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine the first day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

366
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,630
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> second round we</font>

367
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,860
just stopped working so we're like

368
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,650
hitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the targets but not really</font>

369
00:17:52,860 --> 00:18:00,240
hitting them and yeah so test everything

370
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:03,810
out before going yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> something will</font>

371
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:08,700
usually go wrong so plan plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ford still</font>

372
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:10,679
it's a ton of fun yeah other lessons I

373
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,950
learned I don't know if we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> time for</font>

374
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,470
them but computer vision stuff I thought

375
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was going to be crazy hard it kind of</font>

376
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">is but it's not as hard as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought to</font>

377
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,810
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just opencv</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I started doing</font>

378
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,790
it all in C C++ but then I found out you

379
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,800
could do it in Python and it's actually

380
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:32,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty fast because all the computer</font>

381
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,620
vision it still happens to see pythons

382
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,670
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> gluing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff together and one of</font>

383
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,120
the most important<font color="#E5E5E5"> things i learned</font>

384
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:42,300
between last year and this year was only

385
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,699
doing the math on the area of the screen

386
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,280
that I need so<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year we had a 720p</font>

387
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,870
camera and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty slow we had</font>

388
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,360
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second delay because of all the</font>

389
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:55,530
image processing we were doing this year

390
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had a full 1080p image I would find</font>

391
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,860
the targets and I already know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

392
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:02,040
target kind of is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to move</font>

393
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:05,070
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole scene so I can just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

394
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,899
my target detection on a small area

395
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,460
around

396
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:13,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">um it and it just made a huge difference</font>

397
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:16,070
just with the image processing I didn't

398
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about service efforts and gear</font>

399
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,580
motor controllers<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a great talk</font>

400
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,639
yesterday at motors so I would you

401
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,460
brought you guys already know<font color="#E5E5E5"> laser</font>

402
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,410
voltages so when you buy a not super

403
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,620
cheap like fifty dollar laser online and

404
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:32,810
they tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> three volts don't put more</font>

405
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,149
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> three volts I put more than three</font>

406
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,919
bolts<font color="#CCCCCC"> and died within like a second</font>

407
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:42,590
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I bought it so I had to order more</font>

408
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:45,860
be careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> um software stuff yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did</font>

409
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:49,310
all my firmware for the stm32<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's i use</font>

410
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,689
the GCC compiler it's all online all the

411
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:53,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the code for this stuff is online</font>

412
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,520
that the thing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cad files might be if</font>

413
00:19:53,870 --> 00:20:00,889
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give your interested just let me</font>

414
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:04,100
know the software all the computer

415
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,810
vision i did in python and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know</font>

416
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,320
how much time we have if anyone has any

417
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:13,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions but that's been some of my</font>

418
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,389
experience making laser shooting robots

419
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:26,559
let's have one more round of applause

420
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,559
for Alvaro<font color="#CCCCCC"> by 80</font>
