00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,390
the hacker channel and then also through

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,010
been building FPGA system CP LD systems

7
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,420
since 1979 so he's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the business</font>

8
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,480
for quite a while worked on the very

11
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,570
a lot of experience in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FPGA space</font>

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,300
and somebody who has absolutely warmed

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,350
my heart as a serious fpga enthusiasts

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,350
so Monty

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,670
ah ok very good I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about my</font>

16
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:18,250
projects here okay there are some of

17
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,170
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen all of them are</font>

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,909
open source hardware so all the design

19
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,869
files everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from manufacturing is</font>

20
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:28,270
available from download com github all

21
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:32,289
the same RFP shave ice<font color="#CCCCCC"> is officially</font>

22
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:40,600
baseboards so I have to know press the

23
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:49,380
tab and it doesn't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see I only</font>

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:52,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">have one slide to the tap you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

25
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,479
only have one slide so I have to use

26
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,630
this what I have on the screen my talk

27
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:04,539
was about past<font color="#E5E5E5"> present and future of a</font>

28
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:11,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">pjs and if you look closer top left you</font>

29
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:14,590
see wave which is called monkey motivate

30
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:18,578
which talks about industry trends in

31
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:21,150
electronics and if you look on the time

32
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:27,459
scale you see that the time of officiers

33
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:30,430
depend at 2007 and we are now in 2015 so

34
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:34,420
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not using FB chase today you</font>

35
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:37,120
cannot use<font color="#E5E5E5"> them oops you cannot use them</font>

36
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:40,708
in the Golden Age of fpga we are already

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,680
past that and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next wave is ending</font>

38
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:48,430
2017 so it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I didn't</font>

39
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,730
believe but all I know about past

40
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:55,780
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannot deny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this wave</font>

41
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:57,069
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't exist it takes some work</font>

42
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,889
knowledge to understand that mr.

43
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:08,260
nauseous she did change every 10 years

44
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:12,880
this wave is done by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Japanese dr. Mackay</font>

45
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:17,858
modem which is very big guy in the

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:20,590
electronics industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so and it's a it</font>

47
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:22,370
was used by some presentation ice

48
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,240
keynote

49
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:31,740
aren't I links bird by the events of

50
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:34,290
presentation on new technologies iffy

51
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:37,380
features are in the past wave the

52
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:41,130
question remains<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is now if you look</font>

53
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,140
on the screen until 2017 we have the

54
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:48,299
wave is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> system-on-chip or system</font>

55
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:50,220
in package so it does include large

56
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,080
processor base plate complicated

57
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,960
pedophiles it trans include processors

58
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,770
which include the cpu and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> pga one</font>

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:01,530
die or they may include devices which

60
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:05,550
include the same devices in single

61
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:10,680
package so with system in package the

62
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:15,540
next wave which should start<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 2017 it</font>

63
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe have different name but by them on</font>

64
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:27,630
a list on by 22 horizons they have

65
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:29,340
called it hyper flexible super

66
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,560
integration whatever it does mean

67
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,590
something is happening it should happen

68
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:41,220
in 2017 or some days some years after

69
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:43,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sorry it's notifying what it is but</font>

70
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:52,020
it may be the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> Intel did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

74
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:06,150
the news about Intel having a new

75
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:09,080
technology coming out it's called the

76

high cost of wafer bonding<font color="#CCCCCC"> ganzer</font>

83
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:50,059
through-silicon vias and that the first

devices which come out we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

88
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,469
it's very surprising the best

<font color="#CCCCCC">acknowledgement it come so quickly after</font>

90
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:20,319
our interlude bioterror so one more

91
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:20,319
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can explain it this sorry</font>

94
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:39,009
do promote system-on-chip devices and

95
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:42,050
tools are on this accolade project<font color="#CCCCCC"> link</font>

96
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:45,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">system on chip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from savings on this one</font>

97
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:51,819
I'm sorry on this one and on this one's

98
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:51,819
there are three projects make more and

99
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,999
on the top layer some minimum and

100
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,789
maximum parameters was a speech aids

101
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:04,999
which really scale from very low very

102
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:07,430
small devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> devices to high</font>

103
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:10,219
powered devices and the price range very

104
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,800
large so it covers very much the last

105
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:19,248
spectrum of different type of electronic

106
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:21,860
things it simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> motomiya short it will</font>

107
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:26,899
look so very amazed that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a</font>

108
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:36,610
nice if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have two more minutes yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

109
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:36,610
oh it's can you see this no

110
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:47,550
I did rise for different flows for fpga

111
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:50,789
design flow number a we take a board

112
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:55,110
which can run lineups we are an open

113
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:57,330
source tool chain we write we create two

114
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,790
files first file as three lines of

115
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:04,080
source code second line has two lines of

116
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:08,660
course and then we hit make and we get

117
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:13,380
this to be running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this spj in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> linux</font>

118
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:17,130
compiling and programming the second

119
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:21,330
fpga on this board this was floor number

120
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:25,280
one slot number 2 is<font color="#CCCCCC"> X eiling's system</font>

121
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:29,070
design flow and try to it very quickly

122
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,370
you start by taking a library say you

123
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:34,740
created library component saying you

124
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:39,000
create lots of metadata you have to say

125
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,220
use a manual version number a lot other

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,910
information single package trees as the

127
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:49,350
IP core as a library component<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

128
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:51,630
start again<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hardware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> designer you</font>

129
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,610
put the component onto the converse you

130
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:57,620
make some mouse clicks and connect

131
00:08:53,610 --> 00:09:01,890
things you export it to software tools

132
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,500
you create first<font color="#E5E5E5"> boot loader since I get</font>

133
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:08,550
crazy boot file see in a cop is a boot

134
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:12,180
file to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> microSD card ready curve you</font>

135
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:16,579
plug the SD card to the device and you

136
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:20,780
run it it was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> short version of the</font>
