13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,970
of my life and I'm here today to talk

14
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:33,060
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> creative process and action I</font>

15
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:35,039
was a sassy child I was the kid who got

16
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,560
kicked out of class for speaking my mind

17
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:41,130
too grown-up about subjects that were

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,780
apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> off-limits the kids I got</font>

19
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,208
<font color="#E5E5E5">kicked out of class ones for doodling</font>

20
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,020
which was apparently considered a waste

21
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:51,869
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and disrespectful to my peers I</font>

22
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:55,130
thought silent reading was too quiet so

23
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:58,200
I socialized in the bathroom instead

24
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:00,539
even at age nine you could say I was

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,929
already becoming the architect of my own

26
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:06,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">education I felt rules and regulations</font>

27
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:11,068
warranted regular review I spoke up

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,760
often and maybe a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> too often now</font>

29
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:16,560
reactions to my sassiness were not good

30
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,108
they ranged anywhere from year long

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,720
battles of wills with my teachers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

dismissive<font color="#CCCCCC"> response of oh she's an</font>

33
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,380
artist like that was a bad thing well I

34
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,590
am an artist and it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I see</font>

35
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,660
and feel the world very deeply my cell

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,970
the elderly person on the street

41
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,100
struggling with the zipper of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

42
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:51,090

inventions that could help<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I try to</font>

always create new things my work as an

<font color="#E5E5E5">that inner spunk that inner staff that</font>

49
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,269
drives me to question why do we do the

50
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:14,549
things we do how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that way</font>

51
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:16,530
and what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it this way we need</font>

52
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:20,010
that spunk to push boundaries push

53
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,110
limits and think differently

obvious but without expanded and

83
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,900

88
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,160
need to think to the very core of a

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem and think about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people you</font>

90
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,500
are creating for and then begin dreaming

91

up new solutions it's the fun part the

92
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,690
magic part that anything is possible

about whether you're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> is too out</font>

there or even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the right direction you</font>

judgment to enjoy the fun of creating I

00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:05,849
know you will get this as we're all here

100
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,729
together at this conference sharing our

can shed the self-judgment the faster

103
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,780
the ideas will come I had to blast

104
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:17,729
through my own self<font color="#CCCCCC"> judgment when I</font>

105
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,109
began the studio with my partner to

106
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:21,510
create a hand drive wheelchair

109
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,659
created a hand drive wheelchair

wheelchair and allows it to be powered

112
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,638
in a rowing motion this motion is good

113
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,990
because it's better for

114
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're back as allows you to sit up</font>

115
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,469
straighter it uses bigger muscle<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups</font>

116
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:40,159
so it's more efficient for your body and

117
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:42,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">it also keeps your hands cleaner</font>

118
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:44,520
traditionally lever power wheelchairs

119
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,438
come as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> all-inclusive kit meaning</font>

120
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,909
they're built into the chair and because

121
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,610
of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost anywhere from two to</font>

122
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:52,289
ten thousand dollars but because our

123
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,539
hand drive wheelchair attachment is

124
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:57,180
almost entirely 3d printed and

125
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,800
completely open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> I lost fifty</font>

126
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,270
dollars to make which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is less than one</font>

127
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,960
percent of the cost of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> competitors</font>

128
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,609
on the market when my partner Nathaniel

129
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,438
and I began this project some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

130
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,819
first fantastical thoughts were to

131
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,830
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wheelchair</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that could go up and</font>

132
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,199
down curbs or stairs or to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a</font>

133
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,520
wheelchair with a deployable ramp but as

134
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,800
we thought very<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadly about a</font>

135
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,120
wheelchair users experience we<font color="#CCCCCC"> realized</font>

136
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,520
most of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas when involve a</font>

137
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,729
complete redesign of a wheelchair which

138
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,779
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost prohibitive for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the users</font>

139
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,359
the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've researched and learn</font>

140
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,650
about wheelchair user the more we

141
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,050
uncovered a basic need for wheelchair

142
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,929
speed and comfort and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the need to keep</font>

143
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,430
user costs low it was then that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> began</font>

144
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,879
to focus in on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lever power</font>

145
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,979
wheelchair even though Nathaniel and I

146
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,500
were zeroing in on a direction we kept

147
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:45,900
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions why does the lever</font>

148
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,120
power wheelchair cost so much clearly

149
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,128
there's a gap from maker to user if the

150
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,099
price has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been so high that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most people</font>

152
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:57,899
power wheelchairs cheaper and accessible

to all how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make them faster can</font>

154
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,969
we make them look great sometimes asking

155
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:04,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most obvious of questions can lead</font>

156
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:06,539
to a breakthrough you have to keep

157
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a problem</font>

158
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:10,949
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are solving the right</font>

159
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:13,169
problem for the right reasons this is to

160
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:14,490
say there's great value in taking time

161
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,799
with this beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> phase of the</font>

162
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,479
creative<font color="#CCCCCC"> process to really ponder a</font>

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,810
problem instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately looking</font>

164
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,270
for a solution as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> poet Rilke said</font>

165
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,779
and letters to a young poet live the

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:30,419
question perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> then gradually without</font>

answer being<font color="#E5E5E5"> an innovator a creator a</font>

maker is all very romantic<font color="#E5E5E5"> we portray it</font>

170
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,719
as this dream job full of fun toys great

inventions and lots of cash<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in</font>

hard work the creative process is bumpy

174
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,909
coming up with a new idea is the fun

175
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:56,729
part because there's no responsibility

176
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:59,339
yet it's just an idea and anything is

177
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,929
possible but letting that idea grow and

178
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:04,529
stand up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the test of what really is</font>

179
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:06,208
possible is tough you need to be able to

180
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,969
separate yourself from your idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let</font>

181
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:11,279
it grow people are always going to make

00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:14,189
suggestions make improvements and even

183
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,619
criticize your ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes your idea</font>

184
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:19,289
will change beyond recognition right

<font color="#E5E5E5">before your eyes you need to be strong</font>

186
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:22,949
enough to realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these criticism</font>

187

00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:30,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">let go of a design for example with the</font>

190
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,879
hand drive we really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

191
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:35,909
spring steel for our Springs because it

192
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,409
was sleek and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked the look of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it we</font>

193
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,240
kept trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it for the springs of</font>

00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,099
the ratchets but every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single time</font>

195
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,240
something different went wrong and they

196
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,730
were i were there<font color="#CCCCCC"> bent or they were</font>

197
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,279
springing in the wrong direction it was

198
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,379
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the angle just right we</font>

199
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,600
tried long spraying short<font color="#CCCCCC"> Springs tight</font>

200
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:53,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">Springs loose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Springs the annoying part</font>

201
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,579
was that the spring steel was so hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

202
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,009
cut that every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single time we screwed up</font>

203
00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:02,670
it was a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> process to cut the right</font>

204
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:05,310
piece again it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing how willing</font>

205
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,550
we were to ignore the obvious the spring

206
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,439
steel wasn't working after working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

207
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:13,229
it for a full month we<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally had to</font>

208
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:15,269
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go it felt devastating to work on</font>

209
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,139
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for so long and just abandon</font>

210
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:20,569
it giving up is hard but necessary

211
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:23,069
failing is part of the creative process

212
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:25,380
over time failure becomes less<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

213
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:29,219
personal stab and more of an inspiration

214
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,740
to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> again in fact during the</font>

215
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,139
brainstorming process maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one out</font>

216
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,360
of every<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 ideas actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has potential</font>

217
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,149
as this idea develops there will be

218
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,189
complications every step of the way

219
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:42,839
don't give up we are on our sixth

220
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:44,790
prototype of the hand drive and have

221
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">been through hundreds of sub prototypes</font>

222
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:50,240
we've printed so many parts that it's

223
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:53,220
amazing our 3d printers aren't on fire

224
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,800
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outside one my view our sub</font>

225
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,640
prototypes as failures but we see them

226
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,010
as necessary

227
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,569
very steps to an end it was through all

228
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,430
these sub prototype failures that we

229
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:07,290
made important discoveries about force

230
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:09,989
design and material to use speaking of

231
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,819
force I was lucky<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to be invited</font>

232
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,640
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> White House to present the hand</font>

234
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,500
day long the hand drive worked just fine

235
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,360
for all the Senators and<font color="#E5E5E5"> scientists but</font>

236
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:27,290
naturally as soon as President Obama

237
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:30,570
tried it it broke what a powerful man

238
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:34,560
when things fail don't give up keep

239
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:36,360
moving forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> failing</font>

at other times our strengths<font color="#CCCCCC"> flip flop</font>

we all see the world differently and

critical it was for wheelchair to be
