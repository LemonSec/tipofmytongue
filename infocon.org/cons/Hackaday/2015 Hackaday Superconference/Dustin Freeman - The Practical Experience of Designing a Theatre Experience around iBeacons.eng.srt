00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:36,300
our next<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaker is Dustin Freeman</font>

2
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:39,719
Dustin's background is in math and

3
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">theater and he's combined these with</font>

4
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,930
works as a spatial interaction engineer

5
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,579
at occipital<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he makes a structure</font>

6
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,039
sensor it's really great I just had a

7
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,539
preview of it so definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> participate</font>

8
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,449
with him afterward in the question and

9
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer his time when not working though</font>

10
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,699
has spent creating immersive interactive

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,289
theatre experiences and this is what

12
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:09,960
he's talking about today please welcome

13
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:12,330
to the stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dustin Freeman uh check</font>

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:20,548
check I assume everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> can hear me well</font>

15
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:23,130
out there fantastic ok let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> open this</font>

16
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,470
up so today I'm going to talk about a

17
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">really practical experience of like the</font>

18
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,650
previous sock this is really practical

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,869
of designing an immersive<font color="#E5E5E5"> theater</font>

20
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,670
experience around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I beacons which are</font>

21
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,860
localized beacon which give you a rough

22
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,299
measure of how close you are to them if

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,979
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a device that can sense them</font>

24
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,530
and this is done<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a theater</font>

25
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">company called floodlight this project</font>

26
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,200
was by me Dustin and the guy on the left

27
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,610
josh marks now Josh mark is all dolled

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,979
up in this photo<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he's primarily</font>

29
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,689
works as an actor and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're an</font>

31
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,398
background is pixels literally so that's

32
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,750
why my photo looks different right now

33
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,570
he's an associate professor of act of

34
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,570
acting at San Jose State I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spatial</font>

interaction engineer by day at occipital

36
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,329
in soma and I work on computer vision or

37
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,919
at least not on the core of computer

38
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,530
vision itself but on making computer

39
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,670
vision usable to hack with

40
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,810
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> project has nothing to do with</font>

41
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,589
computer vision it has a lot to do with

42
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,850
immersive<font color="#E5E5E5"> theater and improv</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> theatre now</font>

43
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,600
I got to talk a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about flood</font>

44
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,010
light um but I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend as</font>

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,810
much time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> theater philosophy part</font>

46
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,220
of this I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move right into the</font>

47
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,670
practical experience of dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

48
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,980
hardware sensor so<font color="#CCCCCC"> floodlight is</font>

49
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,359
primarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh's project he looks at</font>

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">theater experiences that you wander</font>

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,580
about wander through interact with

52
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,620
rather than sit and observe passively

53
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,540
the idea is that to be immersive you

54
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,910
should feel like the main character the

55
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,179
agency means you're able to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

56
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,470
and have an effect on the show and feel

57
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,720
that you have an illusion control even

58
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:59,730
though and the the mechanics of the show

59
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,230
itself may be really controlled another

60
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,399
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is particularly important is</font>

61
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,679
a sense of secrecy your exclusivity

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,989
which leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a sense of intimacy with</font>

63
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,980
the show itself now that's some

64
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,019
philosophy that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to put</font>

65
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">onto the side I'll get back to you later</font>

66
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:16,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">and deal directly with ibeacons so I</font>

67
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:20,459
begins are a close-range proximity

68
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,690
protocol it's defined by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

69
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,260
got a few ibeacons from a company called

70
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,690
webel who sponsored us they gave us some

71
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">ib consider the brand x y find it so</font>

72
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,829
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the size of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beacons in</font>

73
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,679
my hand if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a device in this case</font>

74
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:37,049
i used an iphone 6 i can ping the

75
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">ibeacons in a surrounding area and get a</font>

76
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:43,680
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how close I am to them</font>

77
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:45,390
practically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got a iphone to beacon</font>

78
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,730
distance of plus or minus fifty percent

79
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,149
within a range of five centimeters to 10

80
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,858
meters so it's not perfect and the

81
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,570
Restless talk is basically how do you

82
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:59,640
deal with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> now in an ideal world so</font>

83
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,989
so so here's like a first a really basic

84
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,119
thing you could do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do with</font>

85
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,970
this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have a bunch of I beacons</font>

86
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,320
and say a museum and instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

87
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,530
an audio tour where you click through

88
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,608
the audio tour plays at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific</font>

89
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,470
time when you're next to a certain

90
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:15,120
painting that would be a really basic

91
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,200
thing you could do we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

92
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,160
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more interactive</font>

93
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,488
where you're able to have an effect on

94
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,359
the world at its most<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

95
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:27,388
choose your own adventure style

96
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:30,359
experience one annoying thing we noticed

97
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,439
is that if my experience involves me

98
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,499
moving objects around because we can

99
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:38,099
embed these beacons and objects is that

100
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:40,560
if on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left you see there's two</font>

101
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:43,020
beacons about a meter and a half apart

102
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,069
from the phone on opposite sides the

103
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,719
phone for<font color="#E5E5E5"> three meters apart from each</font>

104
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:47,340
other and that looks the same to the

105
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:49,620
phone the<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone being the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> God in this</font>

106
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,498
sense or the observer in a sense that

107
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,810
looks the same as them being adjacent so

108
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:56,789
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a scripting scenario</font>

109
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,409
or a scripted scenario where I bring an

110
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:01,650
object and I put it next to another

111
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:08,759
object we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> no idea if someone's</font>

112
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:11,549
done that um another thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> no die</font>

113
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,340
just go quiet okay haha another thing

114
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,590
thats related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that let's say</font>

115
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">I wanted to I want to do a trigger when</font>

116
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,919
someone is looking some at something I

117
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,000
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

118
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,219
they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at something we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,539
really get<font color="#E5E5E5"> there look vector they could</font>

120
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,439
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> walking by something they could</font>

121
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:29,039
actually looking in the opposite

122
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,990
direction and backing into it so this

123
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,400
entire project was basically how to

124
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,029
write software to deal with the

125
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:40,919
uncertainty that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> harbor gives us so</font>

126
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:42,659
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the layout of the speakeasy well</font>

127
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,068
it's called the speakeasy it's a bar

128
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:46,379
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this show in during</font>

129
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:48,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">the day the bar was nice enough to offer</font>

130
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:52,379
their space<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us when it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't open</font>

131
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,688
and it was nice because it was a it<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt</font>

132
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,969
like a real space it didn't feel like

133
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:58,560
one of those spaces that you set up

134
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:59,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything in and the players that go</font>

135
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,259
into the space know that everything

136
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:03,719
that's in the space is there for a

137
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,159
specific reason so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> should play</font>

138
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:06,629
through the experience like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an RPG</font>

139
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:10,500
player where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab everything that</font>

140
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:11,969
isn't nailed down so this bar was fully

141
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,229
stocked there was like booze behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

142
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:15,330
and everything we didn't tell people not

143
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:18,330
to drink it and they didn't so that's

144
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,830
good so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you had this in a</font>

145
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,000
video game environment right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

146
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,250
say you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a scripting</font>

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,479
experience in a video game environment

148
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,159
with objects and you have you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas</font>

149
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,979
like the back room or behind the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar and</font>

150
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:33,899
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just define like rectangular prism</font>

151
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,789
volumes that when the player enters that

152
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:38,879
volume then you'll start a certain

153
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:40,009
trigger or you'll move the state of the

154
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,349
story to another point

155
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:44,210
or you'll change some variable this is

156
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:47,449
we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really know at any given</font>

157
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:51,739
time where the person is let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

158
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:53,479
put a beacon on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door from the book</font>

159
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,490
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the perspective of the phone as</font>

160
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,710
they hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with them you know that</font>

161
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,050
they saw the door<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the door went</font>

162
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,619
missing so there's you don't know if

163
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,749
either they backed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the door or</font>

164
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:08,149
you just lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> the signal for that one</font>

165
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:11,419
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame or they went through</font>

166
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:13,159
and if you see the door<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see the</font>

167
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:15,649
door and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then see the door again they</font>

168
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:17,058
might have gone through and then backed

169
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:18,919
out or they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be going through</font>

170
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:21,889
slowly and you lost signal briefly and

171
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:24,049
then you you saw the door again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

172
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:25,039
back inside now hypothetically you could

173
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">just double or triple the number of</font>

174
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,120
beacons and do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice</font>

175
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,770
locational triangulation thing but we

176
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,379
only had access to this space for half

177
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:36,080
an hour to set up in so we brought this

178
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:39,919
plan down in a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper brought it</font>

179
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,539
home and printed it off and what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

180
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">is we did something called a wizard of</font>

181
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:46,878
oz technique um how many people have

182
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,499
heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> The Wizard of Oz technique cool</font>

183
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,469
a couple of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is really</font>

184
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:52,639
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to prototype how you think</font>

185
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:56,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">something should work without getting</font>

186
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">your head stuck down in code so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I if I</font>

187
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,349
if I went and just coded up what I

188
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,330
thought would a be a nice scripting

189
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:04,128
system for this environment I would have

190
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,808
all sorts of implicit assumptions of how

191
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:07,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">people would move around how people</font>

192
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:10,759
would behave how I would play it if I

193
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,709
was playing it right so what we did is

194
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,930
myself and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh iterate through about</font>

195
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:17,240
four different schemes of how we ran the

196
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,459
logic of a script and the way we did

197
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,769
that is we print off this this floor

198
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:24,439
plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we take like a board game piece</font>

199
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:26,120
and one of us would move the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board in</font>

200
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,219
peace around and the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> person would</font>

201
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,499
act as<font color="#E5E5E5"> The Wizard of Oz as the man</font>

202
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:32,360
behind the curtain reading the script at

203
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:34,219
what they thought was the correct point

204
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:40,430
and that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that's how we</font>

205
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:41,569
prototype behavior so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

206
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:44,779
live environment that responded to the

207
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:46,459
user we want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be open how many</font>

208
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">people over over her I've heard of those</font>

209
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:51,349
like escape the room games yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

210
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a little bit like that there were</font>

211
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,850
objects defined

212
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:58,490
clues to read but but what both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

213
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of cared about is not I mean I find</font>

214
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">those experiences a little bit frantic</font>

215
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,260
and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically just kind of try to</font>

216
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:04,790
pound through all the puzzles as quickly

217
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,930
as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to make something</font>

218
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,550
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more relaxed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

219
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,638
narrative we also notice that there was

220
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,620
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lag to the beacon</font>

221
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,930
detecting you like sometimes if you

222
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,100
walked by it quickly like maybe two or

223
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,760
three seconds so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage</font>

224
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,019
people to be slow and contemplative we

225
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,459
want there to be compelling choices we

226
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,760
also wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be kind of ambiguous at</font>

227
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:30,290
the end so i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you what</font>

228
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,959
the start looks like and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is me</font>

229
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:40,069
playing through with the GoPro let's see

230
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:41,180
how do I know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great so I don't</font>

231
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's audio for this but that's</font>

232
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">fine so the conceit is you show up at</font>

233
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:48,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">this environment Josh welcomes you says</font>

234
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,779
he's really busy the this bar is

235
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,899
undergoing renovation he send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

236
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:56,240
upstairs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go get this painting and to</font>

237
00:09:53,899 --> 00:10:01,190
bring it back down to him and he gives

238
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,089
you this phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some a headset and</font>

239
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,699
you put your<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff to put the earphones</font>

240
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,600
in and stick the phone in your pocket

241
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:06,949
now what's cool about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> design of this</font>

242
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,449
for us is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I work on visual</font>

243
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:10,099
augmented in<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual reality during the</font>

244
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:11,149
day so there's really nice to design

245
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,430
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had nothing to do with</font>

246
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:16,610
like rendering anything it was pretty

247
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,050
much all audio cues we got three voice

248
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,569
actors who are friend of ours to record

249
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:24,800
a bunch of audio triggers maybe there's

250
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:27,800
about 70 in total and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got people to</font>

251
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,479
put it in their front pocket here now

252
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,810
big mistake both of us are<font color="#E5E5E5"> men who</font>

253
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,130
typically wear pants and women who

254
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,510
showed up would sometimes have pucks

255
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,370
were too small for a phone or it

256
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,130
sometimes wear a skirt and so they would

257
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:42,350
put the foam behind them in a backpack

258
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,839
or sometimes would hold in their hand

259
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,839
and since we actually calibrated all the

260
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,389
trigger radiuses based on it having be

261
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,889
next to your leg they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> messed up</font>

262
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:56,720
some of our triggers so make sure you

263
00:10:51,889 --> 00:11:00,199
test<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a variety of ways so after</font>

264
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">you after this intro finishes then you</font>

265
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:04,579
get sent up and he'd say i'm going to

266
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:06,140
i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read instruction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going</font>

267
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:06,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">to not read i'm going to speak</font>

268
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,660
instruction

269
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:12,830
to live he'd say live as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go through</font>

270
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience he pretend that he was a</font>

271
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:19,240
live off after a while you'd realize

272
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,240
that clearly these are pre-recorded

273
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:30,809
so if you memorize the map from before

274
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:34,079
you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're entering the door</font>

275
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:37,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the speakeasy there be a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> options</font>

276
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,748
you could go to from here there be clues

277
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,889
and audio that would entice you to move

278
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:46,790
toward an object or pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up an object</font>

279
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:46,790
there was also this on the table on the

280
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:53,519
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see so there's a lamp there that</font>

281
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:59,730
we had a that we had a beacon in little

282
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:09,079
trigger certain behaviors in the cash

283
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:11,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">register was also a beacon and here's a</font>

284
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:15,269
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a manifest that have a bunch of</font>

285
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,559
clues and an extra information so what

286
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,329
was cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the beat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I beacons as</font>

287
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:23,339
well is we're actually able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> embed</font>

288
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:24,779
them in objects so<font color="#CCCCCC"> josh sends you up to</font>

289
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,889
get this painting for him and he says

290
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,139
it's very important that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go get the</font>

291
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:30,410
painting and ignore any other

292
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,149
distractions<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see in the room and</font>

293
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,738
this here's this book on this table here

294
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:37,110
and as you approach the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book it actually</font>

295
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:38,610
starts to whisper at you touch the book

296
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,139
touch the book touch the book touch the

297
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,850
book and if you come within another

298
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,249
radius threshold it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually begins</font>

299
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:49,319
speaking to you and gives you hints to

300
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:50,759
turn to different pages so here's but in

301
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:52,649
this in this video<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't see us</font>

302
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:55,679
follow the branch the book you just go

303
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:57,449
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the painting and head out and so</font>

304
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,549
it's also nice is I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that showed</font>

305
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:00,660
you those little hexagonal units there

306
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:01,860
were the ibeacons you actually can take

307
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,629
this apart in the circuitry inside is

308
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,519
pretty small so we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

309
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:07,439
unobtrusively stick them inside the

310
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,929
binding of a book stick them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back</font>

311
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:17,339
of a painting and it worked super well

312
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:23,279
the yeah let me just let me just skip

313
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:24,509
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of this yeah so here's</font>

314
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,139
the layout of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the beacons in the</font>

315
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:31,139
space and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> radius is the approximate</font>

316
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:36,119
trigger threshold so where the book was

317
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:38,879
which is which is here we add a large

318
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:39,790
threshold that entices you to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

319
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,890
the book

320
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">then a small threshold which which is</font>

321
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:47,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">where the book starts starts talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

322
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:49,180
you now one thing that's interesting if

323
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,550
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with physical objects as</font>

324
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,959
opposed to again as opposed to a 3d game

325
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,540
in a 3d game environment you get

326
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything that</font>

327
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,510
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you wouldn't need to be</font>

328
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">guessing this stuff with physical</font>

329
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,170
objects and sensing you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

330
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,400
know what the user is doing so you have

331
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,160
to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> your scripting system so that</font>

332
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,230
you guess so we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

333
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,150
close to the book we fantasize about

334
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,700
maybe lining the book with tin foil so

335
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,230
that you notice so that you know if the

336
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,410
user to open the book or not and put a

337
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,660
beacon inside that didn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> out who</font>

338
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,939
is too hard that we couldn't reliably do

339
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,800
it so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we like the way the</font>

340
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,480
scripting system knew that if you

341
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">interacted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and were chosen to follow</font>

342
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,140
the path of the book is the book would

343
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,630
tell you to open it turn to a certain

344
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:36,160
page and then bring it and then on the

345
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:40,030
page would say go to go to the couch

346
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:43,390
actually go to this lock box here so

347
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:45,220
then we can't we can't just in the audio

348
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,020
tell people to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the lock box</font>

349
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,310
because then that means they might they

350
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,870
might accidentally hear it when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

351
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,540
wat when they're walking by here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

352
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:55,330
that just<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't make sense you're not</font>

353
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,349
your you have the user hasn't show or

354
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,460
the player essence shown that they

355
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:02,620
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to fall the path to this</font>

356
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:05,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular book um another thing here</font>

357
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we had to trigger is the lamp on on</font>

358
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,650
the table here<font color="#E5E5E5"> had its own beacon and</font>

359
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,719
the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you read the</font>

360
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,540
manifest here you fun at the lamp was

361
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,300
magical was magic a magic lamp not a

362
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,589
wishing lamp though and if the painting

363
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,589
was actually curse and if you brought

364
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:24,760
the painting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lamp then you purify</font>

365
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:27,550
it and purify the curse but we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

366
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,840
initially we had the lamp here and if

367
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">you if you just brought the painting</font>

368
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,120
straight out sometimes the the phone

369
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,470
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the playlist viewpoint would</font>

370
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,140
see the lamp and the painting at the

371
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,060
same time and assume that you'd that you

372
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,170
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> purify the painting when in</font>

373
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,119
fact that might might not have been

374
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,790
users intentions so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

375
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,120
shove the lamp as far away from your

376
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,680
exit route as possible so again really

377
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,480
interesting stuff really interesting

378
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably had to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would not</font>

379
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,089
be a problem at all in a 3d

380
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:57,249
virtual game environment but totally our

381
00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:02,730
problem in real space with sensors that

382
00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:05,139
are imperfect so initially I thought the

383
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is our first draft of the script we</font>

384
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:11,110
wrote together is about 15 pages in a

385
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:15,339
Google Doc that had this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rough</font>

386
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,990
notion of triggers like so certain

387
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,179
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen when you're closer certain</font>

388
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,319
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> will happen you go out of range</font>

389
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:21,939
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wrote this and then agreed on this</font>

390
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:25,300
and then my assumption is the programmer

391
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:29,559
was to convert this into a one or a

392
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:31,839
couple finite state machines um quickly

393
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,300
it became apparent that that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

394
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,709
work very well because again we didn't

395
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:42,639
know what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were where people were</font>

396
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:45,579
at any given time<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote something</font>

397
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,009
that spat out HTML so I could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

398
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:49,748
the so it was so I brought over<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

399
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:52,029
kind of XML format that spattered HTML

400
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:53,889
so that it was actually readable as a

401
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:55,869
web page but also I could parse it in a

402
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,879
script<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually run the run</font>

403
00:16:55,869 --> 00:17:00,389
the game that ended up<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

404
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:06,099
clumsy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ended up like with to JSON</font>

405
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:09,429
files<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks on the Left defines all the</font>

406
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:12,730
beacons and their<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs and their trigger</font>

407
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:14,289
range so here for example here's the

408
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:18,390
beacon that's built into the painting

409
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:22,390
and here's this<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's electronic ID uh</font>

410
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:23,679
and here's a book and here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book</font>

411
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,289
and we need that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have like an in</font>

412
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,760
range and then we have a really close

413
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:30,510
range threshold and these have to have

414
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,890
to be all determined empirically

415
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,850
empirically not because there's perhaps

416
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,169
is because there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

417
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,740
antenna<font color="#CCCCCC"> variance but also as there's</font>

418
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:40,240
variance in how you'd orient your body

419
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,350
towards it and also variance and when we

420
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,720
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want these triggers to go off</font>

421
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,949
so you rent around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and walk closer and</font>

422
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,270
farther<font color="#E5E5E5"> from each of these objects and</font>

423
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,909
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested what the right range was</font>

424
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,010
and what we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that was actually</font>

425
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:53,529
all for holding holding the phone like

426
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,700
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our hand and going around and</font>

427
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:56,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">like looking at what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the range was on</font>

428
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,120
each beacon but then when we played the

429
00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:00,610
show we people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put the phones in</font>

430
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,189
their pocket which bumps out all the

431
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,408
range is larger so kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> at last</font>

432
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute we just actually hard-coded in</font>

433
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:10,550
another script it's just we add

434
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,840
d % to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes you test</font>

435
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,909
the same way that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font>

436
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,620
things and then of course some people to

437
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:17,020
actually put their<font color="#CCCCCC"> their the phones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

438
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:21,290
their backpack behind them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

439
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:23,840
complicated it even more so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

440
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:25,639
that's the the JSON file that described

441
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,870
all the beacons and their individual

442
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,030
data on the right is a series of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

443
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,350
call listeners so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a</font>

444
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:37,460
finite state machine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the script</font>

445
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:39,439
system moves through we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big a big</font>

446
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,110
list of listeners that could be

447
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,250
triggered at any time so one listener

448
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:48,500
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> triggered by I see the door and</font>

449
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,920
when I see the door I can do a couple

450
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,540
things it's most likely play some audio

451
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:58,030
that's the basic listener will just play

452
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:58,030
some audio an advanced listener will

453
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,260
well it also will describe its play

454
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:06,320
style like does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in queue so it</font>

455
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,420
doesn't interrupt other playing audio or

456
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,280
does it interrupt where it'll like

457
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,540
interrupt any playing audio and play

458
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,440
immediately so it's kind of like an

459
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:17,480
emergency<font color="#E5E5E5"> narration these these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lister's</font>

460
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,880
would also potentially activate other

461
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,610
listeners like let's say let's say

462
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,430
you've seen the painting then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can turn</font>

463
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">all all the listeners that the book will</font>

464
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,520
say oh you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> the painting whereas</font>

465
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,660
the book wouldn't say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> before so</font>

466
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,760
instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> having this is actually much</font>

467
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:35,510
much easier to debug than a big finite

468
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:39,290
state machine so I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

469
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:40,910
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> left I could talk a little bit</font>

470
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,370
of player types of personalities in

471
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,530
detail one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was interesting is</font>

472
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:49,370
that there's too<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people who play</font>

473
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:52,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">escape the rooms which people people who</font>

474
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:56,570
run through things really fast and I

475
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:57,860
guess for<font color="#E5E5E5"> art for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our sake they were</font>

476
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,870
they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like find the best</font>

477
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,060
solution whereas we kept this story kind

478
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,350
of ambiguous and you kind of had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

479
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,700
choose who decide with and there wasn't

480
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,300
really a puzzle to solve it was more in

481
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:11,960
orbit narrative experience as for where

482
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:14,389
next everything was self contained on

483
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,620
the device but if and the device didn't

484
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,020
actually communicate elsewhere but you

485
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine that the device could</font>

486
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,850
communicate to an external server and

487
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,740
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on lights or</font>

488
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,590
sound or you could have more than one

489
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,380
person playing in the same space what

490
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea was really interesting is that most</font>

491
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,100
smartphones can pretend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be ibeacons</font>

492
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,930
themselves it's like let's say you you

493
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,879
sent two<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in on an experience</font>

494
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,680
together you could change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the behavior</font>

495
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,540
of the system whether they're closer

496
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,650
farther apart and if they're still

497
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,970
wearing headphones you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

498
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,630
individual audio so one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

499
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of fantasized about was if you're</font>

500
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,570
far away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the person say like 10 10</font>

501
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,920
meters away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other person like</font>

502
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:54,419
you get you hear whispering in your ear

503
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:56,660
a conspiratorial whispering anyway this

504
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:59,450
is it if this is interesting to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

505
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:02,400
josh is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually getting mounting a show</font>

506
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,900
called the circle or well based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave</font>

507
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">Eggers the circle which is going to use</font>

508
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:10,200
ibeacons at San Jose State on<font color="#E5E5E5"> November</font>

509
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,840
eighteen to twenty first and you're

510
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,050
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to much if anyone knows the book</font>

511
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,610
the circle it's about this dystopian

512
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,110
social network that collects you that

513
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,209
gives you points based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

514
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:26,070
and so we they've rigged up a building

515
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:27,390
with a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> I beacons and yeah they</font>

516
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,950
bring they bricked up basically a huge

517
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,120
version of the painting with a bunch of

518
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,230
ibeacons they're going to view points

519
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,929
based on how you wander around this

520
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,930
immersive<font color="#E5E5E5"> theater space and that's it</font>

521
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:47,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright one more big round of applause</font>

522
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,420
for Dustin Freeman

523
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,660
obviously he<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows what's going on with</font>

524
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,340
using ibeacons for tracking things very

525
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,720
precisely through this project I'd love

526
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,760
to talk more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that with the</font>

527
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,280
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer but he is also that</font>

528
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,250
a spatial interaction engineer with

529
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:08,190
occipital which has a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great 3d</font>

530
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:11,270
camera for tablets and cell<font color="#E5E5E5"> phones so</font>

531
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,270
make sure you ask them about them
