1
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:38,160
so next up is Rory Aronson who has a he

2
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,050
is a finalist in the hackaday prize he's

3
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,319
got something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> farm bot which is</font>

4
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:48,899
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CNC planter so it provides water and</font>

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:55,969
seeds it's pretty neat<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

6
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,969
mic right here I've mic on me thank you

7
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:06,990
Oh perfect yeah everyone my name is Rory

8
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,909
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything I do is open</font>

9
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,369
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really believe that that's kind</font>

10
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,009
of the future of humanity is through

11
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,970
collaboration through sharing and so I

12
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:20,070
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you guys today why I think</font>

13
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">by good documentation is really vital</font>

14
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,289
for open source projects and really the

15
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">open source movement as a whole to give</font>

16
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,810
some background my project is called

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,029
farm bot as so if you said it's

18
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,950
basically a really large 3d printer but

19
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,929
instead of extruding plastic it plants

20
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,880
seeds in the ground and then it waters

21
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:40,550
them and it uses sensors to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,140
the soil the plants in the environment

23
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the way this project started was</font>

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,220
about two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago I wrote a white</font>

25
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,720
paper that described everything about

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,110
this project that I had ever thought of

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,600
and I publish it online I said here it

28
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">is internet whoever's out there who</font>

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,449
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me I put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my email address</font>

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,500
my phone number had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little janky</font>

31
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,869
website where people could sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> up for a</font>

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,700
newsletter and people started contacting

33
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:09,299
you saying hey this is cool I'd like to

34
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">help out so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really being open source has</font>

35
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:14,910
been a part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> farm bot project</font>

36
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,650
since day<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero so it's really ingrained</font>

37
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,950
in this project and in everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

38
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,019
we do and so through my experience I

39
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,089
really you know I kind of wanted to

40
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:25,769
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out why why is open source so</font>

41
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,510
important and what what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that</font>

42
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,390
differentiates open source from

43
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,609
proprietary so the traditional thing

44
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,910
here is proprietary one I make a thing

45
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">to I keep the thing to myself three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

46
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,370
thing remains my thing you guys can all

47
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,010
just stay over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the thing is mine</font>

48
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,980
sorry maybe I'll maybe I'll sell it to

49
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,870
you maybe I'll sell parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

50
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,420
but at the core the thing is mine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

51
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,859
remains mine open source as we probably

52
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,958
all know it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit different I</font>

53
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:57,570
make a thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I share the thing</font>

54
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,829
with you and now the thing is ours so

55
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,829
now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the opportunity to</font>

56
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:03,780
collaborate I've given the opportunity

57
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:06,780
to you to further improve the technology

58
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,049
or the project and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of push humanity</font>

59
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of us forward whether it's just</font>

60
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:12,300
having fun or actually developing a

61
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,500
project

62
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,570
really matters<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it can improve</font>

63
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,180
people's lives so that's kind of the

64
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference here of a formatting so</font>

65
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,050
little off but whatever so the

66
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,080
difference is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one word I share the</font>

67
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:28,320
thing with you that to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really what</font>

68
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,930
is defining open source so being open

69
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,269
source is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share to shares to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be open</font>

70
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,180
source so that was kind of really

71
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,560
powerful for me to realize that and I

72
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,760
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another step further I said well</font>

73
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,180
okay what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even mean</font>

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,950
to share maybe at its core<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's to</font>

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,990
distribute knowledge I'm up here right

76
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,600
now I'm sharing with you some knowledge

77
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:51,840
that I've gained so i'm distributing

78
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,329
that to all of you in this room but

79
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes that's not good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough you</font>

80
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,410
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe this this lecture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

81
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,790
be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> insightful for you maybe it's</font>

82
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,690
not maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough so I kind</font>

83
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,549
of asked the question well what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

84
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,900
mean to share well you know if we're

85
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this project if we're going</font>

86
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be open source and really try and</font>

87
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,100
disseminate this technology how can we

88
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,830
share it really well so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

89
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,600
includes a couple more<font color="#E5E5E5"> things than just</font>

90
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,840
distributing knowledge and I'll talk

91
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next three points in context</font>

92
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,369
with what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing at the farm bot</font>

93
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,950
project so the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

94
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:28,500
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very thorough and concise</font>

95
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,360
in the way that you're sharing I'm sure

96
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,510
we've all looked up some documentation

97
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,940
before and there was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of</font>

98
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,580
half-assed<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were missing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pieces of</font>

99
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">information there was diagrams that</font>

100
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,950
weren't complete and so you're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

101
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,110
seeing there scratching your head and

102
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,610
it's almost you almost wish there was

103
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,780
different documentation at all like it

104
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,050
would have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> better if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just figure</font>

105
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,669
this out myself from the get-go<font color="#E5E5E5"> so to a</font>

106
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,240
degree being thorough is really

107
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:56,310
important for sharing well and on top of

108
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,510
that being concise nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> likes reading</font>

109
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:02,220
through just you know very dry lengthy

110
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,870
documentation where you're saying come

111
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,220
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the point gets the point so</font>

112
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,500
you want to be thorough and concise with

113
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,230
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing at the farm bot</font>

114
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,180
project we have this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font>

115
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:15,630
documentation hub online it's powered by

116
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,910
a company called<font color="#CCCCCC"> readMedia I oh really</font>

117
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,880
recommends their service it's free for

118
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,280
open source projects it's essentially an

119
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,180
online documentation hub similar

120
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,130
actually to hackaday io

121
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,170
so really recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we have</font>

122
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,810
everything we've ever done on here as

123
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:34,340
far as the hardware goes so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

124
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,630
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduction about the hardware</font>

125
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,580
we have how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a raised bed if</font>

126
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,080
you've never done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that before</font>

127
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,469
step-by-step assembly instructions tips

128
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,960
and tricks for tweaking the hardware

129
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:51,650
photos that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken all this text</font>

130
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,080
pin mapping<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bills of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> materials we really</font>

131
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,429
pride ourselves and going into depth

132
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,859
about all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being very</font>

133
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">thorough with what we do you know it's</font>

134
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">one thing just to provide a bill of</font>

135
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,510
materials it's another thing to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

136
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,550
is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much it costs from these three</font>

137
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">different sources so here's how you can</font>

138
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,870
go online<font color="#E5E5E5"> and buy it without having to</font>

139
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,130
do all this research yourself so we

140
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">really pride ourselves on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being thorough</font>

141
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,969
and concise we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a software</font>

142
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,300
documentation hub so we have diagrams

143
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:20,270
and you can see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> our API works and</font>

144
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,610
all those different things in order to

145
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,060
fully understand this project

146
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:27,710
furthermore with hardware and software

147
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,210
there's versioning you know we have

148
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,700
progressed over the last two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

149
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,590
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we find it to be</font>

150
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:37,039
very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share with everybody</font>

151
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,840
how we got to where we are today it's

152
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,160
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to say here here's the product</font>

153
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">as it is today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you kind of look at</font>

154
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,320
and be like wow this is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool but</font>

155
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get here why did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you come to</font>

156
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,599
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion or this design versus</font>

157
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,250
this design and so we really think it's

158
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,830
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> share the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> design</font>

159
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:58,430
process so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have documented all the</font>

160
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:00,430
hardware since version one that was two

161
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,020
years ago or maybe even<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer than that</font>

162
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,240
so you can go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see exactly</font>

163
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,099
how the design changed over time we

164
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,290
share<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you all the issues that we</font>

165
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,060
found in the proposed solutions and you

166
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,090
can see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it progressed so you</font>

167
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,350
understand the whole product since its

168
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,260
inception and we think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

169
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,670
important for newcomers to the project

170
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,730
to really understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and push it</font>

171
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:24,380
further so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean to share</font>

172
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,730
well you're distributing your knowledge

173
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you're being very thorough and</font>

174
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">concise we think there's a couple more</font>

175
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:35,720
things we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it a dialogue no</font>

176
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,710
matter how thorough we are we understand

177
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're never going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be throwing</font>

178
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:42,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">off so we want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

179
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,630
the conversation sharing is not just a

180
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,270
lecture it should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a two-way</font>

181
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,090
communication a dialogue conversation

182
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,250
about how to move forward so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

183
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:55,190
being explicit in saying hey if you have

184
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,110
any questions let us know so you know

185
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">all over our documentation hub we say</font>

186
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,100
stuff like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you interested</font>

187
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,960
in developing this here's my email

188
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,690
address here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the forum where you can</font>

189
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,830
go online<font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk to us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

190
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,390
other people who are involved with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

191
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,780
project here's the wiki where you can

192
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:13,159
document your own progress we're here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

193
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,960
help you know that's the whole reason

194
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,810
why we're open sourcing this is that we

195
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,340
hope other people use this technology

196
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,240
and so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to help you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

197
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,590
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know github has been really</font>

198
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,570
instrumental for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as well</font>

199
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,640
especially in the software realm if you

200
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:32,120
find a bug let us know because then we

201
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,848
can fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and help us and you and</font>

202
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,799
everybody else so that collaboration and

203
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,289
that that dialogue is really important I

204
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,228
think for open source projects here's

205
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,630
our forum it's all free software powered

206
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,030
by I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's discuss or</font>

207
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,710
that other one but there's a ton<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tons</font>

208
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">of free software out there and services</font>

209
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:54,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can use to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make your open</font>

210
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:57,410
source project a conversation not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

211
00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:00,020
blog post with no opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for for</font>

212
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,839
collaboration and here's our wiki as

213
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,210
well where it's powered<font color="#CCCCCC"> by mediawiki so</font>

214
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,070
anybody can share their progress it's

215
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:11,120
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just us sharing knowledge with</font>

216
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:12,830
others it's many sharing with many so we

217
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,740
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really important in</font>

218
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,830
improving the dialogue of an open source

219
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,170
project so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it mean to share</font>

220
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,110
well distribute knowledge be throw-in

221
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:27,620
concise and make it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dialogue last we</font>

222
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,300
think you've got to have fun it's it's

223
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">no fun to work on an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open source project</font>

224
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,630
if you're not having fun and it's also

225
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,650
no fun to be looking through dry boring

226
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,920
documentation so whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font>

227
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:43,250
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> a YouTube video or throwing in</font>

228
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,620
some animated gifts to make a funny meme

229
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,089
or you know whatever it is that you

230
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">think is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the documentation</font>

231
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:51,630
more fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> I highly encourage that</font>

232
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,100
to make to make working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these things</font>

233
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun because that's why that's why we're</font>

234
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,320
all doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because we find it fun</font>

235
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,910
in some way one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do is at</font>

236
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,550
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of every assembly instruction I</font>

237
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,160
just give a thumbs up it's like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

238
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:08,130
stupid but it's fun it's fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me at</font>

239
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,689
least if not only like a pat on the back

240
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,400
to whoever's following these

241
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,870
instructions and building something but

242
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,459
it's a pat on the back for me for what I

243
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:19,140
actually made the documentation I'm like

244
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:21,060
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> done with that part finally and then</font>

245
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,740
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also do other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> call-outs we add in</font>

246
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:27,119
videos even<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like little pros for</font>

247
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">the maintenance section farm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bought</font>

248
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,630
enjoys a good sponge bath so make sure

249
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you clean out the hard-to-reach</font>

250
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,500
places cut its nails and treat it to a

251
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,810
massage your farm bot will appreciate

252
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">your loving care and pay you with pay</font>

253
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:41,369
you back with years of vegetables it's

254
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stupid but it's fun and I hope</font>

255
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,490
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little smirk on their</font>

256
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,630
face and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it makes reading through this</font>

257
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,050
documentation a little bit more

258
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,310
enjoyable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and less of a chore when</font>

259
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,790
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn how to use farm</font>

260
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,599
bot take care of it build it whatever so

261
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,339
what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it mean to share well</font>

262
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,100
distribute knowledge be<font color="#E5E5E5"> thrown concise</font>

263
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,360
make it a dialogue and have fun put it

264
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a sentence it looks something like</font>

265
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,060
this great documentation is a fun

266
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,190
thorough and concise dialogue that

267
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,829
distributes knowledge so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

268
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,860
what we think a great documentation is

269
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:16,290
all about why is this important or<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

270
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,200
vital to an open source project or the

271
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,800
open source movement because providing

272
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,050
great documentation is to share well and

273
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,050
sharing is what defines open source

274
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks</font>

275

thanks Rory if anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> has any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

for worry he'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Q&A area out</font>
