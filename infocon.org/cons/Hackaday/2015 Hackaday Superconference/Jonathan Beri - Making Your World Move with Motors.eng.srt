1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,500
like to introduce you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our next</font>

2
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,949
speaker so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jonathan beri is a maker of</font>

3
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,800
all sorts with an affinity for robots ap

4
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,950
eyes and open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source by day he works</font>

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,559
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android and iOS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SDK is easier to</font>

6
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,360
use and by night he can found trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

7
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,459
get PID controllers to work the way

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,199
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to recently he</font>

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,270
contributed to a book called make

10
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,149
JavaScript robotics which is printed

11
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:10,950
under maker media I in 2015 please

12
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:19,700
welcome to the stage Jonathan beri all

13
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:25,310
right I know yeah that's my kid thirsty

14
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right cool thank you very much Mike</font>

15
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:32,450
some UI issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> must have pushed</font>

16
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,450
buttons

17
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,539
no worries as long as the Jolly Rancher

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:46,410
comes back alright cool thanks very much

19
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so I'm speak about motor control</font>

20
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:52,690
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pragmatic guy to motor</font>

21
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:54,550
control I also quoted a song from a very

22
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,200
popular movie<font color="#E5E5E5"> Madagascar I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font>

23
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:00,130
to sing it but have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in your head for</font>

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,500
the rest of the talk so I have a nice

25
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,160
intro but a little bit more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,370
first all you can find me on the

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:10,060
internet under berry berry kix on github

28
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:12,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter that's the cereal not the</font>

29
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,350
immune deficiency and Jonathan beri

30
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,820
everywhere else on hackaday<font color="#E5E5E5"> dad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i 0</font>

31
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:20,350
google+ instructables I I<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably call</font>

32
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,930
my cell<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone maker and I like that name</font>

33
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:26,079
but I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing it since we should</font>

34
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,150
just call ourselves nerds but it's it's

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,220
good to see it coming back full swing I

36
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,400
am NOT a professional electronics

37
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,680
engineer for more designer by day but

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,990
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> tinkering and yeah i wrote a</font>

39
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,000
part of a book called a<font color="#E5E5E5"> javascript</font>

40
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,220
robotics it's about using<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher level</font>

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,900
programming languages to join after the

42
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:48,760
world with different microcontrollers

43
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:50,800
and embedded systems so here's a brief

44
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,230
overview of my talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> an agenda for the</font>

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,670
next 20 or so minutes kind of why I

46
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,209
started this talk is where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

47
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,010
begin my plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> of actually developing the</font>

48
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:02,080
talk because that's interesting in and

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,820
of itself and then start going into

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,970
motors the things that you have to think

51
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">about as a programmatic motor control</font>

52
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,510
expert and then kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of going through</font>

53
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:16,480
the different types and motors out there

54
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:19,840
brushed DC stepper servo ending off

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,579
brushless it looks like the last part of

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,230
my slide is cut off but kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where</font>

57
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,830
I'm going to go next we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

58
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:30,399
continue with this information cool so

59
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,110
why did I do this talk I admitted that I

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,840
wasn't a professional engineer I'm also

61
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,120
not a motor control expert so I kinda

62
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,280
have no idea what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing but I know</font>

63
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,370
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I did a few weeks ago um I</font>

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> building robotics projects</font>

65
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,359
making small for a long time helping

66
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">people build their maker maker faire</font>

67
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,100
demos or

68
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,230
Burning Man exhibits and I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

69
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,000
knowledge built up but no means could I

70
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,739
communicate that with a group of 200

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,500
people so i thought this talk would be a

72
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:02,720
great forcing function to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a little</font>

73
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:07,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more wise and we'll see if it worked</font>

74
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,720
so it was my plan for this talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am i</font>

75
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,339
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to focus on the pragmatic</font>

76
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,560
and pieces you need to know especially

77
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're not in the maquette</font>

78
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">mechatronics side of things so the TLDR</font>

79
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,420
control focused on the most common types

80
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
and motors you might want to use for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

81
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,730
you know a burning man project or even a

82
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,010
robot so brush DC motors stepper servos

83
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,600
and brushless and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cut out a</font>

84
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,159
lot of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> including other types of</font>

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,690
motors closed-loop control kinematics

86
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,980
things like that and that's that's

87
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,910
probably a whole other talk that I could

88
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,710
probably do it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nexus supercon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

89
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start talking about</font>

90
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">motors when it comes to motors there's a</font>

91
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,220
lot of attributes that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

92
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,050
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high end motor</font>

93
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,610
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this nice data sheet just</font>

94
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,410
like looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parts data sheet and</font>

95
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,820
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of information I've</font>

96
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,790
highlighted sort of the key things that

97
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,870
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about when I'm advising somebody</font>

98
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:06,150
on a motor project the type of shaft you

99
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,370
use if it's slotted if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's round will</font>

100
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,109
affect the type of connectors you'll

101
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,790
connect to it obviously the cost

102
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,850
different types of motors have a

103
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,380
different overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost availability and</font>

104
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,010
source ability I think I have a laser

105
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,810
pointer oh cool availability and

106
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,700
sociability are actually pretty key

107
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,560
because while you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a</font>

108
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,650
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> type of motor that meets your</font>

109
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,290
exact hardware requirements you may not

110
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,239
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy it as an individual</font>

111
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,940
really high-end motors that are used in

112
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,250
research and labs or advanced you know

113
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,080
in space you can't buy one<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't buy</font>

114
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,580
ten they won't even talk to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font>

115
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,890
you're a big company doing a big order

116
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,140
so source ability becomes a key can you

117
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:50,250
buy it on Aliexpress can you get it from

118
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:52,530
you know a distributor in the US then

119
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the actual design part of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

120
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:58,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">over there the stall current and torque</font>

121
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,090
are pretty critical that's what happens

122
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,750
if you grab the motor shaft and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hold</font>

123
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,969
it

124
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,620
and it spikes right them the maximum

125
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,050
draw it's going to draw a maximum power

126
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,250
can push out in order that's sort of

127
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,230
your threshold you have our threshold

128
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can work around and the last is</font>

129
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,910
operating voltage there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

130
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,130
drivers out there that are electronic

131
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,080
control drivers that have different

132
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,640
voltage ranges so if you have a low

133
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,750
power system you may not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

134
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,760
actually drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with the particular</font>

135
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">part you've got so paying attention to</font>

136
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,780
those is critical also if your system is

137
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,099
a high voltage system versus low voltage

138
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,599
system you got to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

139
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">consideration the other stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is super</font>

140
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,960
important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll probably need to</font>

141
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,250
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you become an expert or</font>

142
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,320
building something with high tolerances

143
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:41,190
but from a pragmatic point of view you

144
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,169
can not to worry about it so cool so

145
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's start talking about the first type</font>

even in email in high school it's little

stumps with tiny little toothpick

150
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,229
sticking out of it there are often

151
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,510
called hobby motors because they're

152
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,700
super cheap easier interface and are

153
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,190
used in hobby projects or toys or

154
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,820
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> called toy motor as well and</font>

the the actual application fitted in

165
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,840
different types of power ratios you can

166
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,430
get a huge range for low power low

167

that I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cover like gears</font>

170
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:49,020
and encoders they're readily available

171
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,780
and even you can buy it pre attached to

172
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:55,229
the actual motor it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool now</font>

173
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,659
there's a cons of course brushed DC

174
00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:00,510
motors have brushes and those who can

175
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,100
wear out so for you know industrial

176
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,140
applications need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that might not</font>

177
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,640

178
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,640
motors that have replaceable brushes

179
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,770
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd probably put that on a pro so</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually drills and stuff will come with</font>

184
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,180
turning your brush motor without

185
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,190
additional electronics it's not going to

186
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,930
really work out for you and they tend to

187
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,280
be on the heavier side of the abuse as

188
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,050
they grow bigger they have bigger

189
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:34,049
magnets and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not great for</font>

190
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:35,669
like let's say drones cool brush DC

191
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,109
motors and actually motors in general

192
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,630
are you think of it as a voltage

193
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,729
sensitive device you apply enough

194
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,020
voltage across it I'll start moving you

195
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,330
probably play a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more stop</font>

196
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,910
moving faster you swap<font color="#CCCCCC"> the voltage</font>

197
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,110
you'll start moving the other direction

198
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,699
you remove the power and I'll start

199
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,920
spinning freely it's call free willing

200
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,240
you'll see that in data sheets and if

201
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,520
you need to stop the motor quickly

202
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,760
sometimes called breaking you can do

203
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,400
that too it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very elegant way on</font>

204
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,580
DC motors but you just dissipate energy

205
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:09,030
from that motor now it's super simple to

206
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,350
control these and you know if you're

207
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">building a fan and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't care about</font>

208
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,240
very much speed or control just put a

209
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">patent on it right control that voltage</font>

210
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,890
as long as with an operating voltage of

211
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,850
that DC motor you'll start spinning get

212
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,800
a switch on it you can reverse

213
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,490
directions and now you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of the</font>

214
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,770
two main control requirements this is a

215
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,390
little-known application of a rotary

216
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,920
switch but you can have a rotary switch

217
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,660
with a bunch of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> resistive</font>

218
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,400
voltages instead of a pot and now you

219
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,839
have off slow fast it's a simple simple

220
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:45,300
technique that often gets overlooked for

221
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:47,580
more advanced solutions moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font>

222
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,579
to more sophisticated control is the

223
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">humble h-bridge if you've ever built</font>

224
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,200
anything with motors you've seen this

225
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,270
you've probably learned this in school

226
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,089
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's not it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just four</font>

227
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:02,040
transistors that by alternating which

228
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:04,350
ones you activate will flow current in

229
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,540
one direction so in this animated gif

230
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,820
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that we turn on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> upper</font>

231
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,370
left and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the low right and the voltage</font>

232
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,750
goes one way and you swap them so the

233
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,360
upper right and lower left now you get

234
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:18,270
that reverse voltage so that's the

235
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,440
basics of directionality you can enable

236
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,310
those with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole bunch of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">means that we'll look into and depending</font>

238
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,000
on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> power requirements you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

239
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,689
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of transistors right</font>

240
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,930
like simple

241
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:33,090
bipolar transistors tiny<font color="#CCCCCC"> two tattoos are</font>

242
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,489
great for low voltage low power draw and

243
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,950
if you need heavier stuff just throw a

244
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,020
MOSFET on it there's a song in there too

245
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,240
I think but don't forget a heat sink

246
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,010
because they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get really</font>

247
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,810
warm and we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pattern over and</font>

248
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:50,640
over again and other types of motor

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,930
and give you a nice speed control you

266
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,910
still need that H bridge if you want to

that's we get those tiny controls great

329
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,070
great number of controllers can use it

330

with an MCU and actually are

340
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:46,280
as a pragmatic motor controller expert

341
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,750
now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just to DC motors it's</font>

342
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,360
two sets of coils that you have to

343
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:55,370
excite in a certain pattern to help that

344
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:58,690
the magnet go around the ground you can

345
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,130
also notice that this is us exciting a

346
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,260
coil next to each other so it helps it

347
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,820
progress in sort of a clockwise when I

348
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,140
see it I think of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old Simon game you</font>

349
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,810
know the one you light up and you dance

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">dance around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there this is really</font>

351
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,890
important is one thing you'll notice

352
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's two coils adjacent causes the</font>

353
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:17,210
motor to be halfway between it that's a

354
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,220
called a half<font color="#E5E5E5"> steppin you can get</font>

355
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,770
smaller and smaller and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can vary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

356
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,140
amount of power you<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply to each coil</font>

357
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:27,010
so you can get um gradients in betweens

358
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:29,180
that's we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that nice smooth position</font>

359
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,250
you also get breaking for free because

as<font color="#E5E5E5"> long as it's on just stops</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> versus you</font>

361
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:38,510
actually have to force<font color="#CCCCCC"> the break like</font>

362
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:40,969
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> DC example before so you can control</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again we can use our H bridge to</font>

370
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,360
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see most applications are</font>

371
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:04,700
going to use an MCU with a driver<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm running out of time here you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

373
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,930
a driver just like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ll29 a we saw</font>

374
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,850
before because it was like it can drive

375
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,430
to DC motors now you can drive a single

376
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,370
stepper with that one pair and there are

377
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:21,650
fancier drivers that will take a signal

378
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">PWM and a directional control servos is</font>

kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the black sheep it was born out</font>

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:29,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the hobby RC plane market but they're</font>

381
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,160

382

383
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,980
less less on the outside super cheap

384
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,150
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> unique about them is you can tell</font>

385
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,830
them which angle to go to and they'll

386
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,240
stay there and they'll even fight to

387
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,190
stay there so if there's resistance so

388
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,040
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> find more power so it's a</font>

389
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,560
closed loop system on the inside really

390
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,500
nice casing so they're usually easy to

391
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,910
mount and they really work well with

392
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,570
lipos because they're designed for RC

use lipos the cons it can get really

395
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,189
expensive if their industrial servos I

396

397

they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not meant for continuous</font>

398

399
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,050
implementations of that and it requires

400
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,040
a constant signal to keep that position

401
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:15,720
up we'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit about that</font>

402
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:20,099
how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it do it well you supply the</font>

403
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,319
PWM at a certain frequency with a

00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,329
certain duty cycle it's not meant for

405

simple a servo tester with a 555 but

that's not really useful you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just</font>

00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,440
find in drones today and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone</font>

423
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,050
down price significantly because of the

<font color="#CCCCCC">the rise of the that technology and the</font>

425
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:11,159
hobby but also in ebikes because they

426
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,780
can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> generate a lot of torque at</font>

high speeds so price is dropping

428
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:21,420
considerably thanks to drones bikes

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,260
to things like electronic speed

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,200
controllers from drones and I have some

432
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:32,040
here and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're super lightweight</font>

433
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,320
they don't fix positioning they require

434
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,300
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more sophisticated controllers</font>

435
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,760
though you can buy this off the shelf

436
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,379
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are more there can be more</font>

437
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,790
efficient but they can drain a lot of

438
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,930
power I mean drones have like what<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

439
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:48,240
minutes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> hobby drones a flight I'm so</font>

440
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,680
no surprise there's a pragmatic way to

441
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,420
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at them and you look at them as</font>

442
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:56,100
three coils just like the stepper was to

443
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:57,600
DC motors brushless roughly is three<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

444
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,490
if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the diagram you just</font>

445
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,889
alternate again cycle through the

446
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:05,460
different coils and will keep the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shaft</font>

447
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:07,350
spinning and again pulse width is what

448
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,039
drives that and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

449
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,539
these a

450
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,340
electronic speed controllers you

451
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:14,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably can't see from there but on one</font>

452
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,738
side is a microcontroller like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 51</font>

453
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,049
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> atmega and on the other side is just</font>

454
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:20,879
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of MOSFETs so it's just another</font>

455
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">H bridge with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a microcontroller</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font>

456
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:25,799
so happens you can buy it off the shelf

457
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,570
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> even folks who write custom</font>

458
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,570
firmware for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> esc so you can have</font>

459
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:34,799
more sophisticated and more more<font color="#E5E5E5"> options</font>

460
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:36,629
with the controller alright so that was

461
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,119
the whirlwind of pragmatic control

462
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:41,039
mentioned some parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have some demos</font>

463
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,738
so afterwards we can we can take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

464
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">at nasty some questions I got some plans</font>

465
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:48,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the future first of all all this</font>

466
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,889
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> deck has been online for the last</font>

467
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:52,259
few days because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually developed</font>

468
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:54,449
the whole talk on hackaday oh I did in

469
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:56,789
long form have more samples things like

470
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,220
that and you can you can read up and ask

471
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:02,908
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions on there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did want to talk</font>

472
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,979
about AC AC motors solenoids and smart

473
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:06,389
servos which is a whole other beast but

474
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:09,570
I didn't have time so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

475
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:13,349
finish<font color="#E5E5E5"> that up online and there's some</font>

476
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:15,359
code I written samples on Arduino is

477
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:18,450
fine but I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing a lot with</font>

478
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BOS the real time the artists it has</font>

479
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,580
a really nice how so i'll include the

480
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:26,729
code up there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have enough content</font>

481
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:29,129
for at least one a<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed loop talk so</font>

482
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:33,090
maybe i'll just do on a hackaday do and

483
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:36,320
talk to the computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> screen alright</font>

484
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,320
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for me thank you very much</font>

485
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,239
so we're gonna actually let's have one

486
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:52,059
more round of applause for Jonathan beri

487
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay okay so for all your motor needs or</font>

488
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:55,629
questions about any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drivers or</font>

489
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:57,668
setups that he have please join him for

490
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:59,740
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and answer he is also the</font>

491
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:01,299
author of a book called JavaScript

492
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,799
robotics so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in that</font>

493
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,879
I'm sure he'd be happy to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

494
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,408
we're actually moving the

495
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:07,389
question-and-answer area right through

496
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:09,039
the doors where registration was so that

497
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:11,459
you can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more rowdy with your</font>

498
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,460
questions
