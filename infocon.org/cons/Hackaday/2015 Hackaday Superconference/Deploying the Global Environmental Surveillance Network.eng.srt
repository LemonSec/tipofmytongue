1
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:39,739
gonna introduce our next speaker if you

2
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,739
all could come and sit down

3
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:03,950
our next<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaker is Radu mater</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Shem he</font>

4
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,340
came all the way from Romania last year

00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the packet a prize this year he is a</font>

7
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,060
finalist and both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his projects have</font>

8
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,310
to do with environmental monitoring and

9
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,930
specifically global networks that

10
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,520
communicate about environmental

11
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,860
monitoring which is something we really

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,640
have a need for in this world so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

13
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,640
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome Radu</font>

14
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:46,900
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hi everyone my name is</font>

15
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:48,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rodham</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> addition and one project I want</font>

16
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,040
to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you about is the global</font>

17
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,710
environmental surveillance network the

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,890
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> part about this project is</font>

19
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,750
that global attribute and I'm going to

20
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:02,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">go into some details later you'll see</font>

21
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:04,600
what about so one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know</font>

22
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:07,869
about me is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am a software</font>

23
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:12,549
engineer so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess I must be to the</font>

24
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:15,700
wrong conference here anyway the thing

25
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,770
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I like building things and one</font>

26
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:22,750
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons that I got here and got</font>

27
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:24,880
me to hardware and yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

28
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,520
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of potential in the community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,359
makers there is a lot of creativity<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:35,830
needs to find its way to some final

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,620
projects and products because it's nice

32
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,410
to play and the various tests but it's

33
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">even nicer when you manage to make</font>

34
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">something happen something like a</font>

35
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,480
product<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is useful to other people</font>

36
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:53,440
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a finality and it's</font>

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:56,738
not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a test on a bench mark because</font>

38
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,609
most of the projects look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this lots</font>

39
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:04,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">of wires I actually was evolved into</font>

40
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:07,209
some experiments with high voltage some

41
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:10,420
years ago and some of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used to</font>

42
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:13,410
have their desks looking like like that

43
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,958
and yeah there were few accidents like

44
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:19,090
you know ours jumping around and they

45
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,450
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what happened they just woke</font>

46
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:26,140
up on the floor but yeah that was high

47
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:30,609
voltage so even so yeah it's important

48
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:32,798
to to try to be more organized I'm not

49
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,630
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about keeping your</font>

50
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,030
desk clean yeah that's important but hey

51
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,310
this is just a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> detail it's</font>

52
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,160
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be organized in in the fact</font>

53
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,750
that you need to start your ideas so

54
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you're you're doing some stuff</font>

55
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,739
you're building some things but you

56
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,960
really no need to know what's the plan

57
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,980
so if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't tell</font>

58
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,380
to anything it's somehow wasted time and

59
00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:00,850
unfortunately we only live for a few

60
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:04,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">years so yeah I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important so</font>

61
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:07,299
as I said following this path trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

62
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">go for from an idea to something that's</font>

63
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:13,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful is quite challenging and most of</font>

64
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,630
the people I know stop at the first

65
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,480
steps it's a usual a curiosity that

66
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,880
pushes them to try things they have

67
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,640
these ideas there was a commercial

68
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,490
effort it was about some internet

69
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,469
provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's back home in Europe so you</font>

70
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,240
probably didn't heard of it anyway the

71
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,600
idea was that they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

72
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertise the fact that by getting</font>

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,170
internet connectivity we would all get

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,270
to benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> from it because there would</font>

75
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,360
be more people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to participate in two</font>

76
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:50,890
projects and to put their creativity to

77
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,800
use so yeah it's important to to use our

78
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:57,159
resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to put our creativity to</font>

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,710
something that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful so for</font>

80
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,990
that we also need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify purpose</font>

81
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,690
like okay we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to play we like to</font>

82
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,510
spread all those wires and see the LED

83
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:10,480
blinking and you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

84
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but we need to know why we are</font>

85
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,420
doing that so creativity it's something

86
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:18,280
that just shows up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in all of us we</font>

87
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,860
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to channel to channel it to do</font>

88
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,039
something useful and by doing that we

89
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally managed to reach a goal and that</font>

90
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,290
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we managed to to do something</font>

91
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is useful that has a meaning that</font>

92
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,870
usually hurts other people so it's not

93
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:39,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">just us having fun and spreading wires</font>

94
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:42,670
on on our desk getting back to to the

95
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:45,070
project which is also finalist in the

96
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:49,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">haggadah price there was a long journey</font>

97
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:51,570
trying to walk this path and yeah at the

98
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,550
beginning things looked like this and

99
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:58,360
there were also prototypes built by hand

100
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:02,290
and finally it's moved into production

101
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,330
and it looks even<font color="#E5E5E5"> better so yeah it's</font>

102
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,939
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

103
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,729
there were very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources</font>

104
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:10,949
invested in in the process I'm not

105
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:13,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about style it's needed a lot of</font>

106
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">time but by resources I'm talking about</font>

107
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,080
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are accessible to the</font>

108
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,150
regular guy like you don't need to own a

109
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,060
factory to make a hardware product

110
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,000
happen now you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a good</font>

111
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:31,370
motivation a good plan and to know your

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,169
path so to tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few things about</font>

113
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:37,830
about the project<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I stressed the</font>

114
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:39,599
global attribute at the beginning a few

115
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a station</font>

116
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:46,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that does some monitoring I just hooked</font>

117
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:48,509
up of your sensors and had a case which

118
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,050
was rain proof and mounted it outside

119
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:55,020
and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things change in</font>

120
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,870
time how would for instance the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rain</font>

121
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,818
effect the background radiation levels

122
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,840
because you know there is radon and the

123
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:06,719
rain can wash that and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious to</font>

124
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,619
see how the numbers are related and to

125
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:12,330
understand new things from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data it</font>

126
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,990
was quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have it</font>

127
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:19,080
radiation really was constant but I used

128
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,419
it for single temperature side it was

129
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:26,698
quite useful to know whether I needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

130
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:30,359
sweater when hang out yeah well it moved

131
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:33,089
on and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about trying to turn it</font>

132
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,240
into a bigger thing like if it proves

133
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:39,960
useful for me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to offer it to</font>

134
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:44,250
others as well but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't that easy I</font>

135
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,589
had it as a almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> working thing with</font>

136
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:50,009
some wires instead yeah it wasn't really

137
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:52,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cleanest project but i had to</font>

138
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:54,569
structure it in a way that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be put</font>

139
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,719
into production so this includes

140
00:07:54,569 --> 00:08:00,839
documenting everything having the secret

141
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:03,479
plant and tested properly also building

142
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,879
a case also getting into economical

143
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,770
aspects like trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use fewer</font>

144
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:12,659
components were possible or and

145
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:15,430
identifying better supplies but

146
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:19,630
eventually it happened and

147
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:22,150
I happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that at this time this</font>

148
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:24,850
project become known worldwide and it

149
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,280
has like a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred nodes operating</font>

150
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,590
constantly and it also went into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Big</font>

151
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">Data sector because it cumulative a</font>

152
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,520
large amount of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's getting</font>

153
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting not only for the hardware</font>

154
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,500
device itself but also for collecting

155
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,439
that data and learning from<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

156
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,890
extracting statistics and seeing how the

157
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,530
numbers change and yeah there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

158
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,199
of thing to do with data mining and it's

159
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting quite interesting and the</font>

160
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,610
hardware also evolves you can see at the

161
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,700
top there are a few prototypes which are

162
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:00,520
entirely built by hand the one to the

163
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,880
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also did like a few tens of</font>

164
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:08,439
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> soldering by hand after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was able</font>

165
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:11,950
to take my hands from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the production</font>

166
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,430
chain and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on developing new</font>

167
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:18,730
models and trying to improve what I have

168
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:21,130
but as you can see there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

169
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,300
project quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices there and</font>

170
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:28,510
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them had their own chain of</font>

171
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:31,479
design<font color="#CCCCCC"> and production and this one here</font>

172
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,580
is the simplest<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to to build you can</font>

173
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,550
see it is entirely with two horn

174
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,520
components so I intended to give

175
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:42,400
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the maker community in a</font>

176
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:46,300
form which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a fun to assemble this is</font>

177
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,370
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a kid so it gives a</font>

178
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,240
few hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun assembling a soldering</font>

179
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really interesting to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

180
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,730
it works and provides data and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

181
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,760
sends all<font color="#E5E5E5"> data online and can become</font>

182
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:04,480
part of this big system the project is

183
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,760
and all the modules have internet

184
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,690
connectivity these modules here are

185
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:13,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet modules and they can just take</font>

186
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,860
a letter<font color="#E5E5E5"> net cable and it's like plug</font>

187
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">and play you really don't need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

188
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,430
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about network configuration if</font>

189
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:23,829
your router with the internet access has

190
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:27,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">DHCP it will just go online in seconds</font>

191
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:33,510
after acquiring its IP automatically

192
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:37,590
this year I had to think to something

193
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:40,890
better and also complexity raised

194
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,240
considerably and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> model here is what</font>

195
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:47,310
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently running in the heck of a</font>

196
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:50,010
price I had to somehow continue what

197
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:52,170
I've started previously because starting

198
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:55,110
too many projects at the same time will

199
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:58,170
lead you to nowhere so it's important to

200
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:01,380
reach that goal I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about earlier</font>

201
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,390
so my plan was to try to develop the

202
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure and just come up with</font>

203
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:10,050
better hardware and that piece of harder

204
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,020
over there is a device that is portable

205
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,420
has a rechargeable battery has several

206
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:19,560
sensors and is slowly moving towards

207
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:24,060
better asserting the air<font color="#CCCCCC"> quality and the</font>

208
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,800
pollution problem and yeah it's it's

209
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">really interesting because doing some</font>

210
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:32,099
field test I managed to see interesting

211
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:36,150
data correlation in the pollution

212
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,460
patterns the city I come from is nothing

213
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:41,880
to compare to San Francisco for instance

214
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:46,260
it has only like three hundred thousand

215
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:50,460
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it but we have our credit</font>

216
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:53,490
hours and the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the data shows</font>

217
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:58,110
variations related to to those moments

218
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:59,790
and not only that I also made some test

219
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,640
equipment which used the same

220
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,370
infrastructure but it was designed to be

221
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,740
mounted on the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a car and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

222
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:12,630
drove along the city and I was surprised

223
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:15,570
to see a few points which shone elevated

224
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,420
radiation levels so then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I continued</font>

225
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,650
and had the trip<font color="#CCCCCC"> across the country I</font>

226
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,099
just drove for a few hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> kilometers</font>

227
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:25,949
and I saw that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there were hot spots in</font>

228
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,440
radiation and I'm really concerned about

229
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,150
it my my projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> are open source and</font>

230
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,540
the data is available for everyone to

231
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:35,850
see but that part of the data I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

232
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,490
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait a bit until making it</font>

233
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,680
public just because we have some

234
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,980
legislation on strategic resources and I

235
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,459
think

236
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,490
I run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into some areas reaching uranium</font>

237
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:49,849
so yeah that might not be a good idea to

238
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:53,579
make public just yet the idea is that

239
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:56,579
people must<font color="#CCCCCC"> be become more aware of the</font>

240
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:58,680
environment around around them you know

241
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,569
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mishima you know what happened I'm</font>

242
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">not sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how many of you followed the</font>

243
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,230
news those days and world where the fact

244
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,660
that some of the numbers were not

245
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,089
immediately made public so it was like

246
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:16,170
some representative from that company

247
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that had to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the incident and</font>

248
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">they come to the press and just offered</font>

249
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:24,510
some very scarce numbers scared skills

250
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,279
numbers and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data was somehow covered</font>

251
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:29,490
up of course they were forced eventually

252
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:33,089
to recognize the amplitude of the invit

253
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:35,550
of the event but people really knew very

254
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:37,620
little about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it those days and here on</font>

255
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,949
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> west coast I think it was quite</font>

256
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:44,310
problematic with the wind blowing from

257
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:47,459
that side and yeah it is us who who get

258
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:50,160
affected so it's nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned</font>

259
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,869
about making enough sport and eating

260
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthy and things like that but there</font>

261
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:57,899
is more for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into account and</font>

262
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:59,880
unfortunately there are several chemical

263
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,310
and physical factors which are invisible

264
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:08,100
to our eye and we need tools for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

265
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:11,579
and going from that idea to to something

266
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:14,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that can actually be useful to other</font>

267
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,829
people this also comes into the context

268
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,519
of this year's<font color="#CCCCCC"> jacket I price</font>

269
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:24,000
competition it was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very short</font>

270
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:28,170
time to make everything happen and there

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,260
were some some moments when I almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

272
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,510
to abandon the race for instance this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

273
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:37,260
a log please excuse any errors in it is

274
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:39,600
just a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas Eddie dinner in a lot</font>

275
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,029
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to remember the things that had</font>

276
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,480
to be solved<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some of the problems I</font>

277
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:50,880
faced for instance this thing here we

278
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:53,670
had to ship free beta prototypes for one

279
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,420
of the parts of the competition and that

280
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,810
meant that

281
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,569
we had to have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heart already ready</font>

282
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:04,619
and partially working so it wasn't

283
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:06,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have just an idea and just try</font>

284
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,220
to dream of something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could do</font>

285
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:09,959
really interesting stuff no we really

286
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,139
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the real thing put</font>

287
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:16,829
together partially working at least and

288
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:19,790
for me that meant having three units up

289
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:25,138
and running and the problem was that

290
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:27,750
their cds<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had a few and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

291
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:31,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">only left win one functionality left and</font>

292
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:35,790
i needed free unix<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre functional units</font>

293
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:38,579
so there really was no way around it

294
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,349
because I I got some of those lcds from

295
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:44,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">china and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the shipping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a lot of</font>

296
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:48,180
time so I was almost out of the race and

297
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:50,600
the thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution and the</font>

298
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,790
solution involves just a drop in gas on

299
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,620
that screen driver I<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that those are</font>

300
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">CDU's and just hooked up the touch</font>

301
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,370
screen directly to the microcontroller

302
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,079
and interpret that touchscreen<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

303
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:05,630
directly in the microcontroller software

304
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:08,489
there was some XP something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see that</font>

305
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,890
normally did that and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> unable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

306
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,779
acquire more in this full time then I

307
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,180
found some old project which had a

308
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,399
compatible SD and finally I managed to

309
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,339
somehow get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fair CDs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need it and</font>

310
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,410
hook up everything in a useful time and

311
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:24,420
have it ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for shipping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and by heavy</font>

312
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,930
tribe ready for shipping just imagine

313
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,360
the UPS guy calling me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm on my</font>

314
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">way to get your location we have</font>

315
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything ready we have the invoice do</font>

316
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,260
we have the package or packed up and

317
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:39,449
ready to go oh hey uh not yet could you

318
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:43,079
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> give me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some more time it was like</font>

319
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:44,910
and office business hours and I was

320
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:47,939
begging for like half an hour he said

321
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:50,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah okay I just try to get something</font>

322
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,589
else in the meantime I'll get to your

323
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,290
place in half an hour I said the l case

324
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,660
that is the maximum can give me fine be

325
00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:00,060
here in a half an hour then he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just</font>

326
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,550
knocking at my door and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is the</font>

327
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,829
package ready and I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

328
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,260
third unit in my hand uploading the

329
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:10,240
software in the microcontroller

330
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,220
well yeah then just put it everything in

331
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,260
the bubble wrap and it was ready to go

332
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,270
but it was really in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last minute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

333
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just because there were so many</font>

334
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,740
challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the things here were</font>

335
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:23,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">time-consuming issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really invisible</font>

336
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,349
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there they might be</font>

337
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:29,110
really small for you like changing a cap

338
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:32,139
or things like that but wasting time on

339
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:34,029
finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problems is real a problem</font>

340
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,830
and why I'm saying all these details of

341
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:38,710
the inside of the project development

342
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,330
because when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hobby for for</font>

343
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,549
making things and your maker and you

344
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,770
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to experiment and build things you</font>

345
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:46,418
did for fun but things become<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

346
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:49,360
serious because when you try to push

347
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:51,070
that further and move to producing an

348
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,229
actual hardware device there will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

349
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:56,230
challenges and if your motivation is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

350
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">strong enough there won't be anything</font>

351
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,909
fun to push you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move forward like</font>

352
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,639
okay you're having your fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna you</font>

353
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:05,830
just build all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> wires and it's all</font>

354
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,600
great until<font color="#E5E5E5"> something pops up or you</font>

355
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,939
have a problem like the high voltage

356
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,370
thing or things like that but you really

357
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,529
need more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be aware that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

358
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,629
process is wrong and there will be

359
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:19,870
obstacles in order to get to a final

360
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,970
result so yeah it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done but the</font>

361
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:25,029
important ingredients here is the wheel

362
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:28,320
you really need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a strong will and know</font>

363
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:32,620
what you have to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

364
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,870
so the project at this stage because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

365
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,870
want it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also wanted to give you a few</font>

366
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">details on what this project is the</font>

367
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,219
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> has spread considerably all</font>

368
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:47,190
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world what you see here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

369
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:50,049
actual stations the round icons are

370
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:54,120
single stations and these here are

371
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:56,770
clusters of units the bigger the figures

372
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,070
the more units are in one cluster and

373
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:03,760
the parameters selected is average so

374
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:06,370
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just see in one glance just what</font>

375
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,129
the average is and there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a color</font>

376
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:11,260
gradient and this thing here I'm not

377
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:16,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure what what big city is close to this</font>

378
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">location I think here's a Chicago and</font>

379
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:24,160
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably know better I had to</font>

380
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,559
contact that guy and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask him hey is</font>

381
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,240
everything okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like do we have</font>

382
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,850
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical problem is there a</font>

383
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,500
malfunction does your unit needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

384
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:36,040
into support do you need to ship it back

385
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:38,350
to me oh he was so car he said oh no no

386
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,899
no need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send it back my daughter was</font>

387
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:47,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing some experiments for school I just</font>

388
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:50,679
gave her some depleted<font color="#E5E5E5"> uranium and yeah</font>

389
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,570
well at some point I think I'm going to

390
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:57,640
have some problems with the authorities

391
00:19:52,570 --> 00:20:00,100
on this kind of matters so yeah this is

392
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem when you are trying to go on</font>

393
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:12,399
the open-source road everything is

394
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:16,330
visible so I currently have one of the

395
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,309
units with me and I was lucky the guys

396
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,220
here help me get a soldering station

397
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:25,480
this morning so I missed some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

398
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:27,940
first things in the events because yeah

399
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,980
I had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old soldering i discovered</font>

400
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,980
that traveling with the airplane also

401
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,929
causes a lot of vibrations and some

402
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,510
equipment can be sensitive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

403
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:40,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in mind if you design hardware also</font>

404
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:42,340
is part of the stress testing I didn't

405
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:47,830
do much of that yet for for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

406
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:49,899
unit the others are fine like I there

407
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,570
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that list with the several devices</font>

408
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:55,990
this one here it has an aluminum

409
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,480
enclosure so is is rocked and can be

410
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,880
also mounted outdoors it can withstand

411
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,130
the rain if mounted in vertical

412
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,530
positions of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> collectors need to be</font>

413
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:10,090
facing down also the new one is also

414
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:13,540
aluminum and yeah you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see real-time</font>

415
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:16,000
data from the unit ahead here you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

416
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,010
able to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it close in the QA section</font>

417
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,559
later if interested it currently

418
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:23,260
measures the air<font color="#CCCCCC"> quality and some</font>

419
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:28,480
various other parameters related to to

420
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:31,000
air and there also is alpha beta and

421
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,410
gamma radiation it has

422
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,840
r & b 7 1 to Yeager tube manufactured

423
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:42,430
here in the USA it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good one</font>

424
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,280
and I was lucky that I was inspired and

425
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:49,720
had a small modification in my source

426
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">code just before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I left I set a variable</font>

427
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,930
to force and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had as an effect that</font>

428
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:58,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sounds were turned off I just set it</font>

429
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:00,730
to mute by default<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was a good</font>

430
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea because on the airplane I took it</font>

431
