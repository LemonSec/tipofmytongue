1
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,100
alright so next up the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk that</font>

2
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,890
we're gonna have it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> Neil</font>

3
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">mutha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Neil is one is semi finalists for</font>

4
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,680
the hackaday prize 2015 working on a

5
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,320
project which did<font color="#E5E5E5"> haptic feedback was a</font>

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,420
combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ultrasonic sensors</font>

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,879
providing haptic feedback to provide a

8
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,739
vision system to the blind really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

9
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,260
cool project really really compelling

10
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:58,260
technology and again with a really

11
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">strong sort of social interest social</font>

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:06,710
purpose so with that I'll turn it over

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,710
to Neil Neil<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right thanks everyone</font>

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,979
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're gonna be talking about</font>

15
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,200
haptic feedback so haptic feedback is

16
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,670
really just a broadly defined term it's

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,049
all about vibrations communicating

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,610
information to humans through the sense

19
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,780
of touch now i'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,950
the theory a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i don't</font>

21
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we have enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coverage of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wikipedia or on the internet but we're</font>

23
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,119
mostly gonna be focusing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how you're</font>

24
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,880
going to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> this knowledge to build</font>

25
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,180
better products in your hacking hours so

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's get started so why haptics well</font>

27
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,650
basically haptics for the next big step

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,180
in HCI human-computer interaction it's a

29
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,590
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> natural way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work with users</font>

30
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,630
because it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they just</font>

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel and it's not really processed or</font>

32
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,289
any sort of high abstraction layer when

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,789
you think about eyes or visual you is

34
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,140
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really had to think about the amount</font>

35
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,210
of processing that the brain does to

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,970
make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture or like an image of wave</font>

37
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,919
lens into a complete idea or an<font color="#E5E5E5"> image in</font>

38
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,658
your mind whereas haptics are very very

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,219
natural and innate and its really one of

40
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">the older senses that we have sitting</font>

41
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,179
around so haptics are probably one of

42
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,890
the easiest ways to work with users and

43
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,630
have them get what you're doing quickly

44
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,669
the other thing that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> fix allow you</font>

45
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,228
to do is get really fast feedback with

46
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,220
the user the reason is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because if you</font>

47
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about it again about the brains</font>

48
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,130
processing loop

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,840
about a 22 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> millisecond delay or</font>

50
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,790
latency between an image showing up on

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">screen and you understanding that so</font>

52
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,390
having haptics lets you actually skip

53
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,100
the brains processing entirely and build

54
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,000
muscle memory with your users which if

55
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,470
you're building<font color="#CCCCCC"> a product that's going</font>

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,210
to be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> day in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day out with your</font>

57
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,040
users that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a huge deal in</font>

58
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,890
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of increasing their enjoyment and</font>

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,810
use of the device and finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple's</font>

60
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,059
doing it and so is everyone else so we

61
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,590
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well hop in on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and you</font>

62
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,350
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get left behind in the next</font>

63
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">generation of HCI so let's talk about</font>

64
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">the human body first what we're working</font>

65
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,470
with is most commonly the hand now the

66
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,930
hand is just chosen<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a lot of reasons</font>

67
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,940
most mostly because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the most</font>

68
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">innervated part of the body in terms of</font>

69
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,660
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most sensory receptors but</font>

70
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,310
it's also one of the easiest ways to

71
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,200
work with users you generally think of

72
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,690
your hands as being your output agents

73
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world so when you if we lock</font>

74
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,959
ourselves into the hand we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a couple</font>

75
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">different areas that we can target when</font>

76
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,650
we are to thinking about haptic feedback

77
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,239
to the user most commonly it's the

78
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,820
fingertips because the fingertips have

79
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,980
the highest density of sensory receptors

80
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,750
per square millimeter of skin than any

81
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,310
other part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your body the downside is</font>

82
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,200
your fingers are very expensive real

83
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,610
estate in that you use them<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> noticed</font>

85
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,450
if you try to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> something on the</font>

86
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,640
user's fingertip you better be really

87
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">really useful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so as a compromise we've</font>

88
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,000
started to move towards the wrist or the

89
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,590
palm area you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were watches nowadays so that's</font>

91
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,910
considered fair game in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

92
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,290
a space to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user and it's</font>

93
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,120
generally a good balancing ground

94
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,679
between having sensitivity as well as

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,269
being able to stay out of the way most

96
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the time and finally if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

97
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:45,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">building a device that requires the</font>

98
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">users full attention like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say a steering</font>

99
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,420
wheel or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bike handle then you</font>

100
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,549
might as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go for the palms and</font>

101
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,399
require the user really grip on to the

102
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:56,160
device to<font color="#E5E5E5"> engage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with them so again you</font>

103
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,660
have options<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as a as a hacker you're</font>

104
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,220
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be fake baking usually the</font>

105
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,810
fingertips or the wrist because either

106
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,810
sensitivity or staying out of the way

107
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">and being a wearable device so what</font>

108
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,180
happens underneath the skin this is the

109
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,209
part that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get enough</font>

110
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,680
coverage touch is a very complex sense

111
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,000
it's not as simple as just buzzing a

112
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,310
motor and having the user feel that

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,690
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty qualitative haptic</font>

114
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,310
feedback and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's a binary off or</font>

115
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,660
on and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of our phones do</font>

116
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,760
nowadays<font color="#CCCCCC"> right we either know that we</font>

117
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,830
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or an email by the fact</font>

118
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,090
simple fact of having a vibration that's

119
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,849
not very<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful that we want to move</font>

120
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,760
towards quantitative haptic feedback

121
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,990
means we want to convey some sort of

122
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,820
scaling information to the user some

123
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,950
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data that they can figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

124
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,480
based on the pattern that we give them

125
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,190
or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sensation that we're able</font>

126
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,030
to deliver to the user so for that we

127
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,830
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about what actually</font>

128
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens underneath the skin now I'm not</font>

129
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,620
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bore you with a whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bio</font>

130
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,300
but you should know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are four</font>

131
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,770
different types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> neuro receptors in</font>

132
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,390
the skin that actually give you your

133
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,159
sense of touch and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to go</font>

134
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,800
into details on them but they all have

135
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,060
essentially different band pass filters

136
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,650
that let them sense different

137
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,880
frequencies of vibration this is going

138
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become very important because it</font>

139
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,420
turns out that our<font color="#CCCCCC"> brain is really just</font>

140
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,099
mixing and matching these<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

141
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,560
filters to understand the difference

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,230

143
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,630
cotton and water this is really the key

144
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,370
just having different vibrations mixed

145
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,200
together you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about maybe a</font>

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">higher order function for example mixing</font>

00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,770
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different beverages together to</font>

148
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,169
emulate ultimately some haptic feedback

149
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensations so having control over these</font>

150
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,340
specific bands<font color="#E5E5E5"> the five to 15 Hertz ban</font>

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,840
200 300 Hertz and 30 or 50 Hertz gives

152
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,640
you a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of control over what the user</font>

153
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,289
feels it's crazy to think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

154
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,909
imagine if we could through a simple

155
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,400
motor that's operating very precisely

156
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,740
actually emulate senses like the field

157
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,140
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> aluminium or the feel of metal or the</font>

158
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,790
feel of you in carpet it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

159
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,469
there yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're really going to be</font>

160
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,330
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> towards that in the future so</font>

161
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,530
understanding this is pretty key and

162
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,430
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk more about how we're</font>

163
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,679
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually use this information</font>

164
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,850
in our in building a product out of this

165
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,990
so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level explanation the</font>

166
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,070
the skin is looking for essentially a

167
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,350
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of frequencies</font>

168
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,120
of vibration and from that it builds a

169
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,310
picture of you know what are we touching

170
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,570
what are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling so let's manipulate</font>

171
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,360
that let's hack into the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> body</font>

172
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,980
sensation what are our<font color="#CCCCCC"> options to</font>

173
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,170
interface with the user well essentially

174
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,750
it comes down to spinning metal counter

175
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,790
weights on a shaft<font color="#CCCCCC"> a que a motor so</font>

176
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,320
right now we have two major options that

177
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,180
are used by most manufacturers we have

178
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,800
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ERM or eccentric rotating mass which</font>

179
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what I just described a spinning mass</font>

180
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,390
on a motor and that's kind of primitive

181
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,850
it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok but the catch is that it's</font>

182
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">really sort of not very precise and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

183
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,580
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do like really fine feedback</font>

184
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,020
sensations we don't have enough

185
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,700
resolution with that couple of the

186
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,020
problems are that frequency which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

187
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,760
what we really want to control remember

188
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not just a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like buzzing</font>

189
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,310
and having the user feel about having

190
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,559
them feel a specific frequency of

191
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,270
vibration and the problem with motors

192
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">erm is is that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> frequency is tied to</font>

193
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,229
amplitude because

194
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,180
if you want a harder vibration you just

195
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">spin the motor faster that's not really</font>

196
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that good for us the other problem is we</font>

197
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a lot of latency insert in terms of</font>

198
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,930
starting with the motor and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

199
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,940
starting and making it stopped again so

200
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,950
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get very crisp pulses if</font>

201
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,080
that's what we're after but the upside

202
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,640
is for hackers like us<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

203
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple to work with you just toss it on</font>

204
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,969
a board have a MOSFET driving it and

205
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,060
there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go simple drive circuitry</font>

206
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,650
nothin too nothin too fancy with ela

207
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,180
raise though we have a lot more control

208
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,590
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> L Ras are fundamentally</font>

209
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,480
different in the way they operate linear

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:11,580
resin action<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue aters require a</font>

211
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,200
really specific AC drive frequency and

212
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,750
what they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually like rotate a</font>

213
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,810
little mass that just vibrates along as

214
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,220
single axis and through that we're able

215
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,500
to get really precise control over

216
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,150
vibrations the problem is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you</font>

217
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine is very complicated it requires</font>

218
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,690
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of watching the motors back EMF to</font>

219
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,240
figure out how fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's moving and</font>

220
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,410
driving it at a very precipitant

221
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,660
frequency to make sure that we're

222
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting the most out of our motors so we</font>

223
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,850
usually outsource that to a driver chip

224
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,140
so again these are our options but as a

225
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,030
hacker you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably want to start with</font>

00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the easier one so let's do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that let's</font>

227
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,539
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to build a haptic feedback</font>

228
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,469
system into our product what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

230
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,280
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an erm because that's an easy thing</font>

231
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,049
to work with we would start by just

232
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,489
tossing it into a circuit with either an

233
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,130
H braids or just like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> low side</font>

234
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,360
transistor like a MOSFET and you're

235
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to want to just drive it on and</font>

236
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,150
off depending on what your high-pitched

237
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,530
feedback signal is now one of the key

238
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,030
innovations that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people miss is</font>

239
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to just drive the</font>

240
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,880
motor<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and off to indicate that</font>

241
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,860
something has happened that that only

242
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,240
gives you two possible States what you

243
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,610
want to do is start building a system

244
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,690
that's like ppm not pulse width

245
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,700
modulation which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're I'm sure you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">all ephemera are familiar with but pulse</font>

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,849
procession modulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that means is</font>

248
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,100
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send consistent pulse</font>

249
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,810
widths of essentially to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of little</font>

250
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,600
buzzes to the user that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be just</font>

251
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,370
about 50 milliseconds of on time with

252
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,560
the motor those<font color="#E5E5E5"> little pulses add up</font>

253
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,150
over time and we vary the frequency of

254
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,740
those pulses to communicate something to

255
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,750
the user it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the user has a</font>

256
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,760
secondary heartbeat on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their risk for</font>

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">example that speeds up or slows down in</font>

258
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,150
response to some event now this actually

259
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:41,520
improves the resolution we get with user

260
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,110
quite a bit it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say exactly how</font>

261
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,910
much and it depends what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user who</font>

262
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,710
the user is for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I work with the</font>

263
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,160
blind a lot and for the blind this is

00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:52,029
really really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next big</font>

in terms of building<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTI's with for them</font>

266
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:56,569
they really their<font color="#E5E5E5"> timing circuitry if</font>

267
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,579
you will for touch is much better<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

268
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,860
ours and essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

269
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,569
distinguish quite a range of sensory

270
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,879
feedback when we use the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pulse</font>

271
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:06,469
procession modulation now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

272
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,639
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that this doesn't give us a</font>

273
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,160
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of range to work with if</font>

274
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:12,470
you're really fast your pulses will sort

275
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,149
of the cheer rate into a continuous

276
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,170
vibration form because remember that

277
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:17,540
like we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of latency and</font>

278
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,310
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stopping the motor so the</font>

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,379
maximum frequency that we can push to

280
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,029
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> users about say 20 Hertz and the</font>

282
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,269
if you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> tapping the user once</font>

283
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,819
every five seconds these are starts to

284
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,850
forget about the taps and is no longer

287

throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> this into your Arduino code for</font>

289
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,100
linear map between some input data

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">metric it could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> temperature it could</font>

be it could be distance it could be GPS

292
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:45,769

293
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,569
frequency through a simple linear

294
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:50,000

<font color="#CCCCCC">really well surprisingly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well for how</font>

296
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,509
crude it is but the key innovations here

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that we're actually going to be</font>

pulsing the user a little tap system and

299
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:59,000
having that trim map to some sort of

300

309
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:17,990
about two hours of training so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's still work to be done so</font>

311
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,509
what do we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move forward from this</font>

312
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,430
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of happy feedback and what are the</font>

00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:25,699
companies in the space doing now to make

314
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:28,040
this a real thing well<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we</font>

315
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:29,719
start by working more with the motors

316
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,550
and we think more about what is the user

317
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,059
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling when we pulse them a</font>

318
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,199
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> tap of electromagnetic feedback</font>

319
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:38,180
so what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start doing is actually</font>

320
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:39,380
actively breaking the motor and this is

321
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,449
a couple of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually breaking</font>

322
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,309
first increases the sharpness of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

323
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:44,870
wave<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did mention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't show a</font>

324
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,309
square way but really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going to</font>

325
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,529
look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the amplitude</font>

326
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:50,360
or the feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the user feels the</font>

327
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:51,980
the pulses are not as sharp because the

328
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,470
motor has inertia in starting and

329
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,809
stopping so if we actively break we

330
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,730
you're able to get crisper pulses and at

331
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:00,620
the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> save power we save power</font>

332
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,370
because active braking is actually more

333
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,020
like regenerative braking in this case

334
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,510
you're able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to recharge the battery from</font>

335
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,220
the stopping of the inertia of your

336
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,960
motor and for a wearable device this

337
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,150
could mean a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> savings for me for</font>

338
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,730
example I know that the wearable systems

339
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,140
will spend a lot of their power on just

340
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,000
having feedback if that's the primary

341
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,089
mode of contact with the user the other

344
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,180
distance and or so whatever your input

345

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,279
experimentation with this and you might

users an inch a little bit so again this

is up to the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have them train</font>

other crazy stuff like again messing

<font color="#E5E5E5">with the frequencies to sort of play</font>

change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amplitude of the pulse</font>

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,160
because that would change<font color="#E5E5E5"> your frequency</font>

396
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,050
but with ll<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise when you have that</font>

397

frequency locked into place you can

start<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing with amplitude and again</font>

399
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:15,050
this is actually the key to building

400
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,430
more advanced haptic interfaces because

401
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,099
it actually comes down to as frequency

402
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:21,140
control now what the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing</font>

pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it really does emulate a</font>

411
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,089
that is they have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> metal bar</font>

412
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,570
essentially with a bunch of

electromagnets for exactly spacer on it

414
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,940
and what they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they send an</font>

415
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,070
alternating current through the

416
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,649
electromagnets to have it vibrated area

417
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,029
fixed frequency now that frequencies is

418
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,980
very complex to it has multiple

419
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:50,480
components so we have they<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably have</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 to 15 Hertz components to trigger</font>

423
00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:00,199
50 and so they broke up frequency in two

424
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:02,420
bands based on what they know about the

<font color="#CCCCCC">has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done this before because that's</font>

428
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,829
relatively hard to do and also the

429

system if you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the efficiency</font>

430
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:13,969
of it is really bad it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

433
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,550
outside the box in a sense and they went

434
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,930
for frequency control over amplitude

435
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,149
they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a system that</font>

436

able to emanate touch a lot better so

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean for us well again if</font>

445
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,060
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices that are creative in a</font>

447
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,599
because we never know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what will work on</font>

448
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,579
maybe you can develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next sort of</font>

metal bar system that it has better

frequency control than the previous ones

451
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,529
or maybe you just build a special type

452
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,969
of motor that's optimized for one

we can work with the human body and

461
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,880
doesn't have to be motors either you can

<font color="#E5E5E5">start with electronic electronic</font>

be picked up by some of you guys haptic

be instead of using a display on your

476
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,100
project or if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wearable</font>

477
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,589
project start throwing on a motor and

478
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know have some code to you know</font>

479
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:38,620
pulse the user some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of notification</font>

480
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,720
system and then turn that into a

481
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,190
quantitative feedback system and the

482
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,350
stepping stones are in place right now

483
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,850
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it the next</font>

484
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,260
big steps though are going to take a lot

485
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,820
more effort I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue</font>

486
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,319
researching the space looking at

487
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,000
neuroscience and working back up to

488
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,170
engineering but really we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should all</font>

489
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,990
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> be throwing stuff at the wall and</font>

490
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing what sticks so that's pretty much</font>

the end of my talk thank you all for

492
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,110
listening and I'd be glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take any</font>

493
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,110
questions

494
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">we should know that's going to be pretty</font>

495
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:40,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">close to a couple milliseconds on that</font>

496
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,230
order in terms of getting the mast

497
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,630
oscillate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is that has issues</font>

498
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,040
with amplitude and it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to</font>

499
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,960
develop an a device that wasn't designed

500
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,849
around that so piezoelectric modulation

501
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,410
usually involves for example if you

502
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">design it with your phone in mind you</font>

503
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,850
would have a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> surface area behind</font>

504
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,560
the battery for example of some piece of

505
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,150
electric material and you drive that it

506
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,560
also requires high voltage driving

507
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,780
circuitry which we generally try to

508
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,698
avoid with wearables so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

509
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,050
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that but I wish again more</font>

510
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,010
devices like that would exist but yes

511
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:14,188
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be probably the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lowest</font>

512
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:16,170
latency that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can get today um you can</font>

513
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:18,300
ask more questions over there in the Q&A

514
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:21,110
area underneath the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tin d poster that</font>

515
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,109
was amazing
