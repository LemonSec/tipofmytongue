11
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:02,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that happened just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

12
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">up here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is someone said to me you've</font>

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,649
been thanking supply frame your parent

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,869
company for putting all this together

00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:13,030
making it possible and no one actually

16
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:15,430
knows what supply frame does so just

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,250
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick so I the boyfriend does a</font>

18
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,320
ton of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there's a ton of talented</font>

19
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,729
and amazing people there perhaps for

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,990
this group the easiest way to explain it

21
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:28,630
is that it's a group of really skilled

22
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,310
computer scientists who no<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware who</font>

23
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,979
are willing working to build great tools

24
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,090
for the hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> ecosystem and so you</font>

25
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:36,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">should definitely check them out they</font>

26
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,250
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> table over there and there's</font>

27
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:40,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">three people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stanko</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dan and newsha are</font>

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,890
all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and they'd love to talk</font>

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,479
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and I pretty sure they're giving</font>

30
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:49,960
away free t-shirts and stuff so yeah

31
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,729
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point the other</font>

32
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,320
thing that is often<font color="#CCCCCC"> a common question</font>

33
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:55,810
when we have parties like last night is

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,270
what you know where is how could a

35
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,790
located how big is hackaday what's the

36
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:04,090
next thing you're working on and general

37
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:07,000
questions that go into on you know what

38
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,190
do we do as our vision for hackaday is a

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,590
place that publishes amazing articles

40
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,120
and amazing pieces of information and

41
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,640
it's not necessarily my favorite thing

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,980
to speak about because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels a little</font>

43
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,839
bit vain but I find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

44
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:25,298
always interested so I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a</font>

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,370
short talk on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> today this talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

46
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:28,660
not a hack and if you read hackaday a

47
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,239
lot you'll know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most</font>

48
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">common comments to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be left on something</font>

49
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,850
is that that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a hack and so</font>

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,720
actually went and<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked it up for this</font>

51
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,880
and october nine 2004 was the first time

52
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can find that someone published</font>

53
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,810
not a hack and you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started in</font>

54
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,579
October of 2004 so this has got to be

55
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,160
like one of the first hundred comments

56
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:53,500
ever left on the blog and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

57
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,780
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say not a hack that's fine you know</font>

58
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,250
you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to censor anything unless</font>

59
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,040
people are you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being jerks</font>

60
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,569
about stuff so call it not a hack but we

61
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,950
cover a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interesting things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

62
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,429
are being used in ways that they're not

63
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,140
intended and this speech is

64
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,459
of those because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

65
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,420
about editorial vision but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

66
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,459
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a bunch of other stuff too so</font>

67
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,219
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most important thing about</font>

68
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:19,109
hackaday is the huge community that is

69
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,750
revolves around it and the easiest

70
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:24,540
metric to show for that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments</font>

71
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,909
so we just published our<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> post a</font>

72
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,379
couple months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and this morning's</font>

73
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:33,870
count for comments was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 511 thousand 812</font>

74
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:35,040
it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you could say that you</font>

75
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">know some of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are just you know</font>

76
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one or first or not a hack but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

77
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,000
vast majority of those the vast majority

78
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,169
of those is there's a lot of value<font color="#CCCCCC"> added</font>

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,480
there's a lot of value added<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in</font>

80
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,220
different ways and in ways that may be

81
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,290
like look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at something and someone's</font>

82
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,819
like oh this is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> X you should go</font>

83
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,888
right about that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a lot</font>

84
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,708
of our ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> for what we're going to</font>

85
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:56,879
work on next from the comments if we

86
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,919
publish something that's not right

87
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,810
people write about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the comments</font>

88
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,579
and they write with authority and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

89
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,650
cite their work and we're able to go and

90
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,359
and update because you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

91
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,829
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> in print but i'll talk about that</font>

92
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,930
in a second so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually update</font>

93
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,859
things and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice our community helps</font>

94
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,659
us get better and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really what</font>

95
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,720
guides pretty much everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

96
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:21,630
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like to think of our community as</font>

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,229
the Fremen so anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's read Frank</font>

98
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,370
Herbert's dune knows that the Fremen are

99
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:28,530
infinitely skilled like every single

100
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,210
person in that society is important and

101
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,099
they call it being worth their water

102
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,570
they pull their own weight and the

103
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hackett community is very much like this</font>

104
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:39,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">I also use the concept of inclusive</font>

105
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,669
elitism so we encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to be</font>

106
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,199
elite but the better that you get and

107
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,508
the more skills that you have the bigger

108
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,699
your commitment is to transferring those

109
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:50,099
skills and sharing those skills with

110
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,560
someone else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also think of it as</font>

111
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:54,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">our community are the ones that can lead</font>

112
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,770
the way and guide us anybody that's

113
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,449
really invested in the hackaday

114
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,960
community if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

115
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:03,150
inclination can step up and lead the way

116
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,638
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually take advantage of that</font>

117
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">so on I started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just reading the blog in</font>

118
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:13,199
25 and had a horrible job at a butter

119
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,760
factory that I could get most of my work

120
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,710
done in like 90 minutes but had to be

121
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,909
there for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight hour shift and I'd</font>

122
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,560
read every post ID click through the

123
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,110
the articles read all the articles and

124
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,440
lurk in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the comments on and do all kinds</font>

125
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:29,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">of stuff and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saw an ad for writers on</font>

126
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,270
hackaday and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I applied for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

127
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Elliott fellow tired me and Here I am</font>

128
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,120
now and the story is like that for each

129
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,650
new person that we have come in they're

130
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,210
invested in the a cadet community and

131
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:45,070
they really understand us and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

132
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:47,560
much wider example of this is the

133
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,480
hackaday<font color="#CCCCCC"> taio community so we started</font>

134
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,700
this you know some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> posted some</font>

135
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,930
projects and then some of theirs got in

136
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,940
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and like hey we can use this for a</font>

137
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,490
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other stuff and we've seen this</font>

138
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,980
explosion of like micro communities of

139
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,660
people that have very focused interests

140
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,130
they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find each other interact</font>

141
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,800
with each other and it's just the same

142
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">principle echoing on this new set of</font>

143
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,140
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes me really really having</font>

144
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:13,240
excited about it on one of the best

145
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do is after we've hired</font>

146
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,140
someone from the community we trust them

147
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,380
so the thing that keeps hackaday fresh

148
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,789
is when we talk to writers when the

149
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,280
editors hugging the writers you say look

150
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,540
if you spend more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a few minutes</font>

151
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at something you should probably</font>

152
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">write a post about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it even if it's not a</font>

153
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,480
hack and the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you represent a</font>

154
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,310
demographic of the community that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

155
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,320
interested in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same stuff and that's</font>

156
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,210
generally you know people like how do

157
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,460
you decide what goes on the on the front

158
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,840
page and it's like well if it's awesome

159
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,180
and there are enough details to talk

160
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,679
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it why shouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk about it</font>

161
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,410
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the free and open sharing of</font>

162
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,130
information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas is something that</font>

163
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:52,660
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be heralded in I society the</font>

164
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,659
other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets us to</font>

165
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,580
constantly on try new things and so I

166
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,280
don't feel like we're locked into one

167
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,039
specific post type our legacy has always

168
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,429
been covering projects that people have

169
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,350
submitted 150 words in a picture and

170
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,090
maybe an embedded video and you link

171
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,040
back to some other stuff and that's a

172
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,510
formula that's really good but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

173
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,860
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can always be improving upon</font>

174
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:21,190
that and so we're changing and some

175
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,840
people aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy about that very few</font>

176
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,990
i think but sometimes they're their

177
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,940
vocal um but one of the ways that i can

178
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,160
kind of look back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and think you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font>

179
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,180
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing okay is the idea that</font>

180
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,550
we started as hack

181
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,770
a day like one hack was being published

182
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">every day and people still this is our</font>

183
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,460
11th year or actually what this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

184
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,750
12th year now we just finished our 11th

185
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,280
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> people still come up to me and be</font>

186
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">like you know it's better when you guys</font>

187
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,179
were publishing one hackaday now you're

188
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,859
publishing so many things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

189
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,020
back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked it up and four months</font>

190
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the site being launched we</font>

191
00:07:51,020 --> 00:08:00,198
published two posts on februari 2005<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

192
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">ha two posts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know one of</font>

193
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,710
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do is you'll notice</font>

194
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,630
that we don't use three different words

195
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,789
anymore hack a day because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've kind of</font>

196
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,469
transcended that um but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

197
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:13,580
core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is still going</font>

198
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:15,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there and so the short speech for</font>

199
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,460
people don't hackaday is it's the gold

200
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:18,590
standard for engineering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering</font>

201
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,729
sorry the goal centered in entertainment

202
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,030
for engineers and engineering

203
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:25,699
enthusiasts and I a few months ago

204
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:28,190
started putting a asterisk next to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

205
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:29,780
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't stop with</font>

206
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,450
entertainment so a lot of the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

207
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,429
do isn't entertainment it is serious we

208
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,080
might present it in a playful way but

209
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,120
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having conversations and we're</font>

210
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,240
informing people that on can make a

211
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference in our world and we're also</font>

212
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,770
seeing a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> explosion in where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

213
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,410
are coming from in their involvement

214
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,180
there are more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more communities that</font>

215
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,400
are getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> great internet service and</font>

216
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,020
getting enough upward mobility in their

217
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,640
society<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people can have time and</font>

218
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,020
materials to actually do the hacking and

219
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,390
we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it's coming from all</font>

220
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:04,699
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and you know we cover</font>

221
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,720
things that are those daily hacks we've

222
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,370
always covered things that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

223
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,870
inspiration for your next tax we've

224
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,980
always covered things that would give

225
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,410
you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills that you need for your</font>

226
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,160
next big bill build and we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

227
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,990
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that one of the things</font>

228
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that troubles me is that we're living in</font>

229
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the age of clickbait and so we recently</font>

230
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,920
ran a post the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brian done chef wrote</font>

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,720
that was fantastic you can see the title

232
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,310
here 73 computer scientists created a

233
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,060
neural net and you won't believe what

234
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:34,219
happened next and you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

235
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was a story about a bot that was</font>

236
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,710
built to generate clickbait headlines

237
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:42,400
and

238
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:45,160
it works it<font color="#CCCCCC"> works it works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so well that</font>

239
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,930
and and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me the fun thing was</font>

240
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,969
people immediately jumped on this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

241
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments because they're like oh my god</font>

242
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was going to come here and flame you</font>

243
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,860
and then I realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was like</font>

244
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,230
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of content behind this headline</font>

245
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,440
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing is we do publish</font>

246
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun headlines that we do publish on</font>

247
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,490
sensationalized things but we always

248
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,220
back it up with great content behind

249
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:09,910
that and this is what is driving our

250
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:13,540
growth now we want great content because

251
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,760
great content is worth making so

252
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,459
hackaday will continue to publish longer

253
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,350
more in-depth articles at an increasing

254
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,150
rate this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one guiding</font>

255
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,650
light right here and really the only

256
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,800
thing that's keeping us from doing this

257
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,630
way more than we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just having the</font>

258
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,099
people and the time to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

259
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,650
working every day we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a really</font>

260
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,050
dedicated crew as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see pulled off</font>

261
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,459
this amazing conference that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had very</font>

262
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:41,290
little part in<font color="#E5E5E5"> planning so thank you</font>

263
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:43,990
that was awesome and you know hackaday

264
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">io is another great example of that so</font>

265
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have you know few very dedicated</font>

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,560
staff members on jasmine is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,410
community manager and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam is our</font>

268
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,329
community editor and sophie has been

269
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,939
really killing it over there we've had a

270
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:01,120
lot of new tools come out that the

271
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,850
software engineers at supply frame have

272
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,220
spent a ton of time and bled to make

273
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen on things like group chat and</font>

274
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,800
being able to invite people to your

275
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,500
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to form teams better</font>

276
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,550
and distributed engineering is one of

277
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,410
the huge like golden the golden goose

278
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,849
egg right there is like it's great to

279
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,560
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place to have your content but if</font>

280
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,030
you have a place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build the team that</font>

281
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,520
doesn't exist in the house down the

283
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're going that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way as well one</font>

284
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,240
last thing before I move on about the

285
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:34,390
clickbait so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell you</font>

286
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,310
that hackaday is you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> around 1.5</font>

287
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,460
million unique visitors a month and

288
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a great metric but that is not</font>

289
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,710
what we use to decide what we're working

290
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,570
on and we're writing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am of the</font>

291
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,820
opinion that we do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be growing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that dwindles from a Trish</font>

294
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:55,079
so I do watch those numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watch</font>

295
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,790
those numbers as a measure for what we

296
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:04,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">have done and not for what we're about</font>

297
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:06,839
to do so as far as original content goes

298
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,100
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody this following is seen that</font>

299
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,790
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing a lot more posts right</font>

300
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,589
now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running two slots every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

we're at about five to seven posts a

303

<font color="#E5E5E5">things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually looking into</font>

backgrounds and the other three are more

307
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,899
like tutorial like transfer of skill

308
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,069
knowledge that sort of thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

309
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,300
trying to share the story of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">look at sports you can see all kinds of</font>

our engineering of our deep thinkers on

because we're ending we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end</font>

322
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,470
up losing a lot of skills so if you

323
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people that were you know</font>

327
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,790
and i was making videos for us he's our

328
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,410
video producer makes really great

329
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,469
content really interesting to listen to

330
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">but if we don't find people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that have</font>

331
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,000
that dispassion and this long skill set

332
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,300
and tell their story we lose a lot of

333
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and and you know we can have the</font>

334
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,540
cheapest chips and the fastest PCB

335
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,069
fabrication but if we're making silly

336
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,390
choices in our designs because we didn't

337
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,279
transfer the great knowledge that was

338
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:38,579
already hard one I think we're going

339
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">backwards and so we learned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

340
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,699
past and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort of thing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font>

341
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,250
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stories that we're</font>

347
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,260
been doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great job of finding these</font>

amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> BIOS and telling deep stories</font>

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,850
about them

350
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:05,579
we also want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what kind of the</font>

351
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,590
what current tech we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> report on so we</font>

352
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,970
know that you want to know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

353
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:12,210
newest tools are but also what those

354
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,970
newest tools mean so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a I want to</font>

355
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:18,000
say this is the snickerdoodle board<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

356
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whoo so this is I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

357
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,990
Kickstarter Brian jumped on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right</font>

358
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:25,920
away it's running the zinc processor

359
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,960
which is a arm and an<font color="#CCCCCC"> fpga in one chip</font>

360
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,250
and if you're a person that does SDR

361
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,110
here I've probably already been

362
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,120
pestering you to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get you to tell</font>

363
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,520
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the amazing doors this is going</font>

364
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,200
to unlock with Software Defined radio

365
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,970
and no one has given me that answer yet

366
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,590
but someone's got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just need to</font>

367
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,920
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that person and get them to tell us</font>

368
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:47,000
what the implications of these new

369
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:51,530
options and chipsets are going to be on

370
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:55,290
the other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is policing the hype so I</font>

371
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:57,120
really think that funding crowdfunding

372
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,400
has a lot of great social implications

373
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,960
but like almost everything in life it

374
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,970
doesn't take very<font color="#E5E5E5"> many bad actors to</font>

375
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,790
kind of break that sort of thing and I'm

376
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,140
really concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we will break the</font>

377
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,280
way crowd fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll break</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the trust</font>

378
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,319
that some people have in crowdfunding

379
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll lose the opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

380
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,950
really valuable initiatives to get

381
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:17,490
funded because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are being bad</font>

382
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:19,980
actors in the space and so you know kind

383
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,680
of the scariest post for me to run is

384
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,320
when we call on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> kickstarter</font>

385
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:29,400
because the worst thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do is is</font>

386
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,930
be wrong right but if we don't kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

387
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,819
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> together and discuss the things that</font>

388
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,770
we're seeing and say look this is this

389
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,780
doesn't look<font color="#CCCCCC"> right I don't think things</font>

390
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:39,120
have been done here I think we're doing

391
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,760
a disservice so we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to stay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

392
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">top of what what is in the news what is</font>

393
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">really worth supporting and what should</font>

394
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,290
we maybe ask for more demand more

395
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:51,209
information on and I I wrote a bunch of

396
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,099
examples on this and then I decided not

397
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to really talk about him today because</font>

398
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,860
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to keep this positive but and</font>

399
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,410
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other the other place that</font>

400
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,870
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at is on issues that really</font>

401
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,630
matter to us so I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all</font>

402
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,250
remember that the FCC had kind of a

403
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,470
listening session on whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they</font>

404
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,200
should ban on custom firmware in

405
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,769
wireless routers which seems like kind

406
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,149
of a big

407
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:17,550
back if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

408
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:20,459
hardware and and the open source

409
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,319
community and again you'll notice almost

410
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,878
every one of these things we've been

411
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:26,899
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bryan bench off post</font>

as keeping us on the cutting edge and

<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so the stuff that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said that</font>

421
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,770
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really necessarily editorial</font>

422
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,510
vision I often think about us exploring

423
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,730
our soul so we have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing live</font>

424
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,380
events because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great to</font>

425
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,880
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> people together online but as soon</font>

426
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,260
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you meet someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> online and become</font>

427
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,490
really good friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them you</font>

428
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,920
inherently want to meet them in person

429
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,900
and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of supply for his</font>

430
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,460
involvement and and initiatives like the

431
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,690
heck of a prize where we had some

432
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,210
sponsorship involvement we've been able

433
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do more and more and more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

440
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,120
that is like a passion project but they

441
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,070
do get support for things like food<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

442
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,600
beer from supply frame which is a really

443
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">awesome thing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do plus the use of free</font>

growing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> meetup community in the</font>

450
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,800
vibrant so if you're if you're from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

451
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">area if you're down there check that out</font>

452
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,879
we hosted a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tenth anniversary in the</font>

453
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,680
building that's just about to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be opened</font>

454
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,060
as the supply frame design lab but it

455
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,070
was an empty shell so we got to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

456
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:15,399
kinds of good and crazy stuff there I

457
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,649
put on mini workshops and had speakers

458
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,120
come it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the the precursor</font>

459
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,980
testing out if we wanted to do something

460
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,110
amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the super con which i think</font>

461
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,320
is on this list as well we were in

462
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:28,659
Munich for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hackaday prize party last</font>

463
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,149
year and we did a embedded hardware

464
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,560
workshop there<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sprite TM gave an amazing</font>

465
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,410
talk to brought the house down kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

466
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:38,919
like last night we've been so if he came

467
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:41,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">on board with hackaday in december of</font>

468
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,750
last year and has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cranking</font>

469
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,220
up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability for us to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do these</font>

470
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,450
live events and one of the first things

471
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,920
she opened up was our ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

472
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,350
interact with uh tripoli chapters

473
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,670
getting out speaking doing hackathons

474
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,129
this sort of thing which i think is

475
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,600
important to get people who are in

476
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,220
engineering excited about what it's

477
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,040
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look like when they do get out</font>

478
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,390
in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> building hardware</font>

479
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,500
we've had gatherings and lightning talks

480
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,100
at all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

481
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,470
it's like a fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> bay area we've had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

482
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,419
second year at<font color="#CCCCCC"> o'neill's irish pub and i</font>

483
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,680
think we might have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and rent out</font>

484
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,500
the place next year because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

485
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:18,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">grown so large we just kind of banded it</font>

486
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:21,610
the years before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were at a misspelled</font>

00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:25,960
TechCrunch Disrupt in new york in may

488
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:27,490
and we had the maker startup bus which

489
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,770
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bust with a bunch of hackers on it</font>

490
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,780
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build hardware and apps going</font>

491
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,360
between towns participate through the

492
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,940
hackaday dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> io platform and so if we</font>

493
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,620
participated and we were able to have a

494
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,940
sponsorship role in eating hacking and

495
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,919
tracking which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like looking at how we</font>

can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use technology to change people's</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dirty little secret is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just wrote</font>

528
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,300
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrote the posts about it I didn't</font>

529
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,830
have to do any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the planning but uh</font>

530
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,560
everything was lined up way ahead of

531
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">time we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great guests thank you so</font>

533
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,560
Sophie and Chris did was really

534
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:19,990
miraculous and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked about</font>

535
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,450
a little bit yesterday the hackaday

536
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">onibus so we set lofty goals for</font>

537
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,360
ourselves we<font color="#CCCCCC"> spent way too much time for</font>

538
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,950
the the I guess return on investment on

539
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,469
of our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal time and nights and</font>

540
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,550
weekends writing content and finding

541
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,400
interesting stories and that's because

542
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,600
everyone really really believes in it

543
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,840
believes this is that these are the

544
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that matter so putting our story</font>

545
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,770
from the last year and<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking back and</font>

546
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,870
celebrating the things that were good by

547
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:50,770
putting together a volume like a print

548
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:53,350
magazine it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was never intended to make</font>

549
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:56,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">money it was intended</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a</font>

550
00:21:53,350 --> 00:22:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference in what we think is important</font>

551
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,070
and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we are hackaday all of</font>

552
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:05,409
this comes together to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

553
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,450
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly special and I think we look</font>

554
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,770
at hackaday as being all the parts that

555
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,010
I talked about it starts with the

556
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:13,570
community it goes through to our

557
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:16,000
publication site which is hecka<font color="#CCCCCC"> dicom it</font>

558
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:18,189
