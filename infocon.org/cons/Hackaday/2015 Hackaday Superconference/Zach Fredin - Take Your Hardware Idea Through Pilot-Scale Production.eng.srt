1
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:40,350
so our next session there are nine

2
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,640
finalists here for the hackaday prize we

3
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,320
had two tracks this year for the

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,340
hackaday prize one of them was the best

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,100
product truck and there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven of ten</font>

6
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,739
finalists here for that and there are

7
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,690
two for the regular track hackaday prize

8
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">finalists here for that so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

9
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:02,190
seven talks are finalists so with that I

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:06,240
will ask Zack Frieden that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

11
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,369
um he learned to solder when he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font>

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">years old from heathkit videos and when</font>

13
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,140
he was 9 he was making neon sign

14
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,090
transformers<font color="#CCCCCC"> i fraid nine years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old for</font>

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,530
6,000 volts<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's that's pushing it yeah</font>

16
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,170
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> efficient all right I apologize for</font>

17
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">the title it got a little lengthy</font>

18
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:28,290
intended to change it at some point

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:33,750
perfect there you go thank you Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">right there we go same title so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

21
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">an electrical engineer I did a project</font>

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,460
that focuses on neuroscience I'm also

23
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,070
not a neuro scientist so my my goal here

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,699
is to convince you that anybody that has

25
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,720
the inkling to do so can take a project

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,540
take it through pilot scale production

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,920
which all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of define in a second and</font>

28
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,600
you should do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now we're at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,600
better point now than we were 10 years

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,520
ago it's it's way more possible for

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,579
anyone that wants you to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,380
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their basement so we'll talk about</font>

33
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,270
what what I consider pilot scale

34
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,259
production again not being electrical

35
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,840
engineer so I'm sure there's other

36
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,700
definitions out there we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,130
the only electronics project I've ever

38
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,810
done as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the case study so</font>

39
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,370
hopefully we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of teach by</font>

40
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,560
example a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit i'll give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

41
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,440
some hard numbers especially related to

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,640
cost and so forth and we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,980
why there's a bit of a sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> urgency</font>

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,329
about this again why it's why it's

45
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,950
important that we think about doing this

46
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:34,590
now so i'll let scale production well

47
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,450
see if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jif image works yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 90s</font>

48
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,130
technology right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there very nice so</font>

49
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,010
pilot scale production doesn't mean five

50
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,780
units on a breadboard it doesn't mean a

51
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,140
shipping container full of your project

52
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,120
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in that awkward area where</font>

53
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want to make enough devices to send</font>

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,990
out to the world but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not ready to</font>

55
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,340
actually scale up production so I'm

56
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,470
gonna say it's about a hundred widgets

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,410
that's that's how I defined it myself

58
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,990
was you know 100 100 devices what do you

59
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do that well this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a San Diego</font>

60
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,470
Maker Faire a couple weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we were</font>

61
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,470
teaching a bunch of young future neuro

62
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,390
scientists about neuroscience we needed

63
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,190
enough devices that we could give them

64
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the kids to play with and not worry if</font>

65
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,640
one of them broke so if you're

66
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">developing a hardware project and you</font>

67
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,720
make five things you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to treat</font>

68
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,400
them very nicely but if you make a

69
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,720
hundred of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you know chances are you</font>

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,580
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do some stress testing on</font>

71
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,440
them these are the first four that I

72
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,270
made so if i had made if i had made five

73
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,380
of these devices I would have a twenty

74
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,820
percent yield you can see this one looks

75
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,570
great it's because the chip is on

76
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,160
backwards all right this one looks bad

77
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,290
because the chip is on boards because I

78
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,870
d soldered it and reattach it that never

79
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,000
worked this one I got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

80
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,120
aggressive with the solder paste this

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,970
one just I it's an RGB LED it only

82
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,350
showed up green so something went wrong

83
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,140
but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I if I hadn't made a</font>

84
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,670
hundred boards you know I would be out

85
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">of luck I would have one device to show</font>

86
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,000
people will talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the product</font>

87
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,739
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a second too and you'll understand</font>

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,620
why it's why it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

89
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,600
lot of them and any other the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

90
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,890
point you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not stuck with ten</font>

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,870
dollar non<font color="#E5E5E5"> temperature-controlled</font>

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">radioshack soldering irons anymore we</font>

93
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to deal with ferric chloride</font>

94
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,108
you know staining our mom's basement

95
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:22,229
sink you know we have we have the tools

96
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,030
ash Park and and the rest of the PCC PCB

97
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:27,570
manufacturers out there that really make

98
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">it possible to the scale on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

99
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,630
well I got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about my project a</font>

100
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,100
little bit again I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of use</font>

101
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,969
this as a case study so hopefully you

102
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,610
can pull some some data points out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

103
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,920
neuro<font color="#CCCCCC"> bites neuroscience is important we</font>

104
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,330
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know neuroscience is</font>

105
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,240
one of those frontiers in science that

106
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:48,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">we still have a long ways to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you</font>

107
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,860
know there's serious diseases that

108
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,969
affect a large amount of the world's

109
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,100
population that we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

110
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,170
understand you know we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a basic</font>

111
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,490
concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they you know how they</font>

112
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,930
affect people but we don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

113
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,840
cure them you know Alzheimer's

114
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,130
Parkinson's so forth so this project is

115
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,109
about teaching people about neuroscience

116
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,730
getting them interested in neuroscience

117
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,670
hopefully inspiring the next generation

118
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,940
of young and eventually older neuro

119
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:15,300
scientists and a quick history on how it

120
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">all started I have a good friend who is</font>

121
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,130
an architect so he likes to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

122
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,110
with google sketchup he also dabbles in

123
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,940
programming so he likes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play with</font>

124
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ruby</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and he got really interested</font>

125
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,080
reading a Wikipedia article about

126
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,180
neurons and wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to match all those</font>

127
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,229
together so he wrote a plug-in for

128
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sketchup that turns blocks of you know</font>

129
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,890
building into neurons so you can

130
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually create a biological neural</font>

131
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,240
network in in Sketchup and then send

132
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,830
signals through it and watch how they

133
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,260
propagate through through the network

134
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> created so in this case green</font>

135
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,580
blocks<font color="#CCCCCC"> are neurons that are at rest and</font>

136
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,100
then as they as they receive signals

137
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,990
they turn red and they fire and then

138
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,910
that's a more complicated network it's

139
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,190
not animated but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it was you'd be able</font>

140
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,770
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see waves of information propagating</font>

141
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,120
through the network it's but my friend

142
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,789
Andrew<font color="#CCCCCC"> salva said he thought it was a</font>

143
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,090
fascinating<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um he wanted to</font>

144
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:11,220
commit it to hardware we had brunch I

145
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,650
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hardware project we decided to</font>

point2 you saw the video before there

149
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,310
were five devices with neopixels and

151
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,260
version had nine devices and different

152
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,080
indication and a little bit more less

153
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:34,010
less hastily written code but<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultimately</font>

154
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,120
we wanted to make enough neurons that

155
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,140
you could connect them in such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

156
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,090
that you wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to predict</font>

157
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,900
what they did we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a desk</font>

158
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,460
full of devices

159
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,929
that you could freely connect and you

160
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:50,739
know see and see what they do so we use

you ever do solder paste at home by the

171
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:22,419
stencil it's not worth using a toothpick

just kind of follows a follows a reflow

182
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,870
actual boards being refloat and then

183
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,010
here they are being programmed so pretty

184
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,510
pretty straightforward so what are what

185
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,099
our neuro<font color="#CCCCCC"> bites what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our neurons I don't</font>

186

want to I don't want to get too into

187
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:01,900
neuroscience as a subject not a

188
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,430
neuroscientist myself again but

189
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially they're little threshold</font>

190
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,539
detectors so they have inputs on one

191
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,270
side known<font color="#CCCCCC"> as dendrites those are</font>

192
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:13,120
looking at information that's coming in

193
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then they're sending pulses down you</font>

194
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,330
know down through their axon terminals

195
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:20,770
to downstream neurons that are connected

196
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">so essentially when when this device or</font>

197
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,510
this this cell receives enough inputs it

198
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,369
will fire generate an action potential

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,880
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> that signal downstream to</font>

200
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,799
downstream devices this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font>

201
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,450
model once it's all assembled so its

202
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,880
flipped 180 degrees but you can see

203
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,320
there's inputs on one side you know

204
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,580
there's a there's a processor in the

205
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,870
middle and there's an output that you

206
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:46,120
can connect to other devices so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

207
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,800
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with this well the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the classic</font>

208
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,150
demonstration is the patellar reflex

209
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,740
which is the one where you you go to

210
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">your doctor's office and they smack your</font>

211
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,900
knee with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hammer and it causes your</font>

212
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:57,870
your knee to kick up and we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> sin</font>

213
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,360
like that so again the gif image is not

214
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:03,630
great unfortunately but you can see

215
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,490
we're hitting a you know a sensory

216
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,400
element it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a little snap action</font>

217
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:10,080
switch that's sending a signal to this

218
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,990
sensory neural bytes module which is

219
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,960
then sending a signal back through you

220
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:19,410
know to the quadriceps muscle<font color="#CCCCCC"> aka a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nine</font>

221
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,060
grams servo motor we later 3d printed

222
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:25,560
that you know so we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little a</font>

223
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:28,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">little 3d printed model of a of a leg</font>

224
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,729
bone and that was the reaction that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

225
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,190
wanted so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that everybody was</font>

226
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,230
like oh that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool because we</font>

227
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,660
think that this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> visual you</font>

228
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,370
know visual learning for people that

229
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,510
aren't there you know just just starting

230
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,570
to learn about neuroscience we think it

231
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,670
could be a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable tool for them</font>

232
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:47,190
so those are neuro bites you can also do

233
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,479
other kind of creative things so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

234
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,990
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> buggy that I built out of a</font>

235
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,730
cell phone box you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know look this up</font>

236
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,050
offline and you can I can walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

237
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,460
through the diagram<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how the neural</font>

238
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,160
circuit works but essentially it just

239
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,320
sends a series of pulses out to these

240
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,680
continuous rotation servos<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

241
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,060
looks for you know inputs on its bumps

242
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,609
witches and when it sees those<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font>

243
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,290
reverse and go a different direction

244
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,780
let's see if the animation works yet so

245
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,880
there it is in my living room avoiding

246
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,620
my boot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then avoiding this flower</font>

247
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,330
pot and you can see when it hits it'll

248
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,810
it'll actually flash you'll see the

249
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:25,230
action potentials come through this is

250
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,619
actually the fifth generation the new

251
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,820
prototype so we're changing around

252
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,860
anybody can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that come by afterwards</font>

253
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,130
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a closer look but</font>

254
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,440
we're changing how indication happens

255
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:41,160
you know trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to clarify the the</font>

256
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,390
display a little bit this is the most

257
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,790
important part this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why we should do</font>

258
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,189
this thing now so that's me in seventh

259
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,969
grade that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I was at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my peak of</font>

260
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,780
my electronics career kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

261
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,600
all went downhill from there

262
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately and this was in ninth</font>

263
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,180
grade when I got that aforementioned

277
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,769
like 50 entrance right now it's just

278

<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of an ad hoc contest that someone</font>

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,100
inspiration you know it's out there

00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:34,680
there's people that are doing this

282
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:37,370
there's tools out there that thank you

283
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,199
there's tools out there that are free

284

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,839
programming platform it's just a

command-line tool that we use to program

287
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,550
the micro processors it's free his

<font color="#E5E5E5">amazing you know kike</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add incredible</font>

290
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,760
incredible tool you know developed by

291
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">cern you know Chris</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gamble basically</font>

292
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,640
taught me everything I know about it so

293
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:03,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you Chris he's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

294
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:05,459
backstage oh yeah you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

295
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,110
you weren't able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get free open-source</font>

296
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,180
CAD tools you know you had to go by the

297
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,769
programmer now you can make your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

298
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,819
program or out of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino board</font>

299
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:18,089
very easy the tools are cheap you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

300
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,700
bought a old old lenovo laptop for 250

301
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:22,380
bucks on on ebay spend the money on a

302
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,579
good soldering station please you know

303
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll save a lot of heartache and long</font>

304
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:30,599
run by some extra tools and then see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

305
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,839
this all works yeah so that's actually

306
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the the cost breakdown of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the project we</font>

307
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,750
made 125 of them for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 600 bucks</font>

308
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:42,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's processor the LED getting the</font>

309
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,100
circuit boards made by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick connectors</font>

310
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,010
buying on the passive components buying

311
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,779
the wire that wires them all together

312
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually counting overage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too so</font>

313
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,300
when you buy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a bunch of</font>

314
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,310
capacitors you have to buy like the

315
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole real of them so we factored that</font>

316
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:59,579
in as an overage expense and to make 125

317
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,770
of them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my basement you know it there</font>

318
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,969
was still 479 a piece like that's that's

319
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,920
low enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs that if I'm going to</font>

320
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,260
spend a year working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a project I'm</font>

321
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,140
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to commit that sort of money you</font>

322
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,670
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a circuit board I like this</font>

323
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,740
animation actually it's one of my it's

324
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,300
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my favorite ones there's four</font>

325
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,279
neurons that are kind of connected in a

326
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,109
loop here you can't really see him that

327
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
well but though continuously drive

328
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,840
pulses into this network and it kind of

329
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,030
does crazy

330
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,950
predictable things so that was a fun one

331
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:31,860
to put together this is the this is the

332
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:34,920
last point so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a product you</font>

333
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,420
take a design you open source it you

334
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,400
share it you know I shared my<font color="#CCCCCC"> nan</font>

335
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,890
hackaday I oh this is this is something

336
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that happened about a year ago I got</font>

337
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,380
this email from a guy named Joe Berto

338
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,460
he's a biology professor and he's he

339
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,990
studied neuroscience he's under a

340
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,450
scientist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he said this is a good</font>

341
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:53,880
idea like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would I'm not a</font>

342
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,830
neuroscientist but he looked at this and

343
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,450
he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could actually make</font>

344
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,070
this into a teaching tool you know we

345
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,050
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do a collaboration and I</font>

346
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,810
I flew<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Boston about nine months</font>

347
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,819
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we drew we do a brig a big Venn</font>

348
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,500
diagram on the board and like there was

349
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,360
this little sliver of intersection that

350
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,130
was like neuro bites and over here it

351
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,800
was Zach trying to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

352
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,540
design circuits and like Joe is like a

353
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten-year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> veteran of neuroscience</font>

354
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:21,569
education so yeah collaborators will

355
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,160
come from any any place but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

356
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,170
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find them unless you share</font>

357
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,390
stuff and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot harder to share</font>

358
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,250
stuff if you if you don't actually share

359
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,680
it so i'll definitely plug the<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

360
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">source thing too yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we</font>

361
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,819
matched it all together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a</font>

362
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:40,620
company neuro tinker that's that's us

363
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,910
image credits you're you're interested

364
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,520
they're all from Wikipedia but here

365
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:47,959
that's a good thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> include and</font>

366
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,960
that's all I have thank

367
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:59,680
yeah this little guy has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> coated this</font>

368
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:03,100
up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the airplane</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and got a lot</font>

369
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,569
of really weird looks but I made a

370
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,340
little binary counter on it that i

371
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:15,400
thought was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not cool so anyone wants to</font>

372
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:17,770
learn binary come over this<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that was</font>

373
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,660
awesome Zach I'm if anyone has<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

374
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:24,420
for Zach he's going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> over there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

375
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,420
the Q&A area in the hallway
