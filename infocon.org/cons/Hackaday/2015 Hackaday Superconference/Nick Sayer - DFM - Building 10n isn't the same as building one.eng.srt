1
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:37,680
all right so last up in terms of the

2
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:44,460
talks today and then we'll do the final

3
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:46,200
send-off 400 anybody who has questions

4
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,489
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> K anybody who's interested if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,289
want to see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> video that she talked</font>

6
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:54,059
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> by all means go over and meet her</font>

7
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,379
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but that aside now last up in</font>

8
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,940
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talks today is actually Nick</font>

9
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sayer he's a friend of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tindy of one of</font>

10
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,410
the sellers on the tin d marketplace

11
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,080
he's also been a friend of hackaday and

12
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,970
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people here for quite some</font>

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,649
time selling things through all sorts of

14
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:13,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">different channels so Nick why don't you</font>

15
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:15,479
come on up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a big round of applause</font>

16
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,790
for the guy who held out to do the last

17
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,360
talked after the hackaday superpower

18
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:27,810
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're gonna back up</font>

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:29,549
quite a bit here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hi there</font>

20
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,720
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about design for dfm</font>

21
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,180
by the way if you didn't know it is

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,400
designed for manufacturing so making a

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,320
whole pile of them is a little bit

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,320
different process than just making one

25
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,869
right so Who am I so I my little

26
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,979
attendee store is Geppetto electronics

27
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:53,159
so far I've manufactured this list of

28
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,320
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've brought some visual aids to</font>

29
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,369
to show off you can't really see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,469
of the details that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

31
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,329
now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I invite you after I'm done</font>

32
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,339
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come over and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see what I'm</font>

33
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:07,048
actually talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some of the</font>

34
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,690
examples that I brought so dfm is a very

35
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,760
lengthy subject and I was given a very

36
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">brief amount of time to talk today so</font>

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,790
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really going to cover a whole</font>

38
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,790
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

39
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">six Dave Jones really did an excellent</font>

40
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,890
job in talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> dfm in EV blog</font>

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,109
video number 127 what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going</font>

42
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,548
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> concentrate on here is some of the</font>

43
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:27,469
pitfalls some of the mistakes that I

44
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:30,129
have made and some of the lessons I have

45
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:33,019
learned from making those mistakes and

46
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:34,879
this last bullet point here is the

47
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,519
really risky thing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

48
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:40,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about how much it costs to make a</font>

49
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,459
whole pile of widgets and the risk that

50
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:46,220
you do is that you go all the way

51
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:48,139
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process you spend many</font>

52
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,299
hundreds if not thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dollars to</font>

53
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:51,620
make a batch of a few hundred things and

54
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:53,810
you get them back from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your assembler</font>

55
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,530
and you find out that they're worthless

56
00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:00,109
that they don't work and some tragic

57
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,989
thing has happened that has just flushed

58
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:03,980
that much money down the toilet

59
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:07,400
fortunately that really hasn't happened

60
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,260
to me but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the the big risk if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,439
go and assemble a whole bunch of widgets

62
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,548
if they don't work what are you gonna do

63
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">with them you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to plow them into</font>

64
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:20,000
a landfill and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what anybody</font>

65
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:21,530
wants so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a relationship</font>

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,900
here the more of a thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you build</font>

67
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,819
the bigger your quantity discounts get

68
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,519
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your from your parts vendors and</font>

69
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:31,488
your your your assembler so the more you

70
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:34,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">make the more you save but then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

71
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:37,909
course the more you<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend so where these</font>

72
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:39,649
intersections cross is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've found</font>

73
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:41,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">at least in my experience has been</font>

74
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,190
around the one to two thousand dollar

75
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,400
mark you're going to spend that much

76
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:49,430
money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build a batch of a thing and</font>

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,780
then how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> winds up costing</font>

78
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">out on the thing that you're building</font>

79
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">depends on how how many is in that batch</font>

80
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:59,569
but if you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend at</font>

81
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:03,049
least you know a Killa buck or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

82
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:04,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">your your your the assembly cost is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

83
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:06,079
going to be prohibitive you might as

84
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,939
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> just buy the boards individually</font>

85
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:12,560
from osh<font color="#CCCCCC"> Park take them home and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

86
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">them yourself so these from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

87
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,680
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides now the next things</font>

88
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,389
that come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the top are the rules</font>

89
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,820
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm talking about so one of them is</font>

90
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:21,889
minimizing the bomb so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

91
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean and why would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well look</font>

92
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:25,290
at what your assembler has your

93
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,719
assembler is going to do

94
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you pick in place for you now first off</font>

95
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,710
let me disabuse you of one thing if

96
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,620
you're going to be talking about

97
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,669
manufacturing something you're not going

98
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,560
to be doing through-hole you're going to

99
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,840
be doing surface mount so that means

100
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start down the</font>

101
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,280
road of manufacturing something that

102
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,719
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about prototyping in</font>

103
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,520
a minute that means that you really need

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,780
to prototype stuff with surface mount so

105
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,630
if you haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> figured out how to do</font>

106
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,489
surface mount yet that's step one is to

107
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,310
get get skilled at doing that it's

108
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,560
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that hard for what it's worth</font>

109
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,120
in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tindy store I sell a reflow oven</font>

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,210
conversion kits to make that that

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,980
process a lot easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but you</font>

112
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,969
know that that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

113
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,140
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do</font>

114
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,940
because through hole is not

115
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:15,599
manufacturable anymore at any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

116
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,040
reasonable price point<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

117
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,230
assembler going to do for you he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

118
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a pic in place machine a pick</font>

119
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,040
and place machine is a robot<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can</font>

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,200
pick stuff off of the reels of parts

121
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you supply for building your thing</font>

122
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,979
and place them with great<font color="#E5E5E5"> precision on a</font>

123
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:35,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">panel of boards and the parts come from</font>

124
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:39,690
a collection of reels that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are loaded on</font>

125
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:42,750
the machine and loading those reels onto

126
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,670
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine is a labor point for your</font>

127
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,580
assembler it's something that he has to

128
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,860
do also<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> program the machine</font>

129
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,050
if they're not standardized parts how to

130
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,230
recognize them with its vision system

131
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,600
how to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them so the number of</font>

132
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">reels that you have in your bill of</font>

133
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,020
materials which is what bomb means by

134
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way if you didn't know that how many</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of those reels that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have in your</font>

136
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:08,220
parts list is a price point that your

137
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,870
assembler has he's going to charge you a

138
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,460
certain amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money for the certain</font>

number of reels that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he has to load in</font>

140

his machine and if it's a really large

number he might charge you a whole bunch

142
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,950
because he'll have to do your assembly

143
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,930
in two passes he'll have to load a set

144
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,510
of reels on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine place a whole</font>

that well so

153
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:42,129
you have to start looking at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:44,889

167
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:19,448
doesn't work if the change that you make

168
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:23,319
ruins the design then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

182
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:56,019
unhappy about that you've made art not

183
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:58,419
printed circuit boards so prototype it

184
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:59,709
first that goes back to to this thing if

185
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:01,659
it's all for naught if the design

186
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:05,879
doesn't work you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should find that out</font>

before you order a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them so</font>

00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,319
next panel izing when you when you make

00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:13,029
one in your garage you're gonna you're

190
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,349
gonna buy a board from osh park it's

191
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:15,969
going to come and you're gonna use

192
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:17,558
solder paste and place all the

193
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:20,049
components on it reflow and you're done

194
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:21,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">great but your assemblers not going to</font>

00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,749
going to be talking that that boards

see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it very well but there are 12</font>

203
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:37,659
individual boards on here and that way

204
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:40,328
your assembler remember think of his

205
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:42,578
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> he picks a board up he puts it</font>

on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the table he uses a template to</font>

207
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:46,540
squeegee the solder paste onto it he

208
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">puts it down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the robot picks</font>

209
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,209
all puts all the parts on it that's the

210
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,429
part that he

211
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:54,849
can do very cheaply because the more

212
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:57,100
often the robot is working then the less

213
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,879
it's going to cost you because he can

214
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,800
get done faster and time is money so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

215
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,360
want to make sure your panels have as

216
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,179
many boards in them as you can possibly

217
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,860
fit but don't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so big that your</font>

218
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,869
assembler now can't fit them on the

219

robot the<font color="#CCCCCC"> robot has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain size work</font>

222
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,399

223
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:20,469
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to break the panel</font>

224
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,160
in half and then all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

225
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:26,829
cost with formulas change and stuff

226
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,360
other things you'll notice that these

227
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:30,189
are individual boards but they're in a

228
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,050
panel and the panel connects all the

229
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:34,660
boards together to hold them stable in a

230
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,339
matrix but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

231
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,009
pick and place stuff you get back these

232
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:40,389
panels now you've got to chop the

233
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:42,279
individual boards out because you don't

234
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:44,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to see you can't use 30 of them at</font>

235
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:47,079
a time you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to separate them so</font>

236
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:50,199
that's there's two processes for that

237
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,878
tab routing and V grooving they make

238
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:53,679
weak points where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> split the</font>

239
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:55,389
boards apart this was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time I</font>

240
00:09:53,679 --> 00:10:00,309
panelized a board<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I made a terrible</font>

241
00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:02,139
mistake I my tabs here for to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font>

242
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,990
long story<font color="#CCCCCC"> short these tabs are too</font>

243
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:06,490
strong I didn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them weak enough so</font>

244
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:10,079
that they could break easily so i have

245
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:12,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">to dremel all these boards apart so that</font>

246
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,989
that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn from if you</font>

247
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:16,299
can get away with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're if you're</font>

248
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,679
fab if you're bored fab will do it vigra

249
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:19,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">begging is much better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because when you</font>

250
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,939
break the boards apart they have a nice

251
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:23,920
crisp edge on them there's no tab chaff

252
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:26,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the deal with when they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inside</font>

253
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,809
an enclosure usually that doesn't matter

254
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,099
but you know if they'll if they'll do it

00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:39,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">advantage of that so I have examples of</font>

258
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:43,240
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh so here's another one if</font>

259
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:45,729
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do tab routing make sure</font>

260
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,339
that if you have parts that overhang the

261
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:51,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">edge of the board don't put a tab under</font>

262
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:53,529
them this was a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> sore spot for the</font>

USB<font color="#E5E5E5"> Micro</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ESP so you can have you can</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">come up and see the example of where</font>

265
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:58,899
that went wrong fortunately in this case

266
00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:00,399
the assembler was able to work around it

267
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:02,350
otherwise he probably have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to have</font>

268
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,330
broken all those tabs off and that would

269
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:08,500
added to his<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost which I'm sure he</font>

would have transferred now here's here's

another one another lesson I learned I

280
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,620
pay them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little extra they'll</font>

281
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,449
pre-program them for you and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine</font>

282
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,340
that saves you a step but keep in mind

283
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,680
that one thing that's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nice is</font>

284
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,410
that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're if you have in circuit</font>

285
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,660
programming as a post assembly step that

286
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,000
does kind of test out part of your

287
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,500
system right if if you can't program the

288
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,230
controller than you know that that board

289
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,030
needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be reworked so that's that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

290
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,310
kind of a nice thing is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

291
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,980
program them after if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> build them you</font>

292
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,439
know that they that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> survive the the</font>

293
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">process so that's that's a helpful thing</font>

294
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,680
in and of itself but<font color="#CCCCCC"> then also you know</font>

295
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:07,180
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a firmware that's</font>

296
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,349
that's more agile you're going to find

297
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,750
bugs in your firm when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

298
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:14,290
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix them when i made the crazy</font>

299
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:16,690
clock that's these boards here one of

300
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,510
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't understand</font>

301
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,010
fully at the time was a how loading

302
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,110
capacitance on crystals work so these

303
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:26,620
wound up being<font color="#CCCCCC"> 130 parts per million tus</font>

304
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:28,950
too fast so when this was brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my</font>

305
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,300
attention I suddenly had to scramble to

306
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,340
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a way to fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this because I</font>

307
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,530
had 300 of these and if they were no

308
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,450
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was that landfill moment that</font>

309
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,220
I've talked about earlier fortunately I

310
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,250
was able to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a workaround in</font>

311
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,770
firmware that slowed the action of this

312
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,210
thing down by that same 130 parts per

313
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,780
million and I could program the trim

314
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:53,920
factors in in eeprom and all sorts of

315
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:55,930
details that make a nice story<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but</font>

316
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,630
the lesson here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that if I didn't put</font>

317
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,739
an ISP header on that board that really

318
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,390
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have meant that they went in the</font>

319
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,340
landfill because nobody wants a clock

320
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,780
that's 130 parts per million fast that

321
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:09,130
gains<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten seconds a day that's</font>

322
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">ridiculous so put an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP header on there</font>

323
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,880
even if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're going to</font>

324
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,130
use it that can save you from the

325
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,750
landfill moment which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the big</font>

326
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,740
again that's the thing you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid</font>

327
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:24,010
at all costs so that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all</font>

328
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:26,500
I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepared so far my vendors that I</font>

329
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,390
really like I've given shout outs here

330
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,120
mg circuit you may not have heard of

331
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,699
they are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that that I went to</font>

332
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get these boards made the crazy clock</font>

333
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,270
I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> only get them made with one</font>

334
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,340
millimeter thickness which josh park

335
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:42,850
unfortunately wouldn't do they don't

336
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,050
have multiple thicknesses yet so they

337
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,710
wind up doing a really good job though

338
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,420
I'm very happy with them some of some of

339
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,490
the fabs like dirty PCBs they have

340
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,650
idiosyncrasies this is another thing to

341
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,110
watch out for the idiosyncrasies of your

342
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:59,620
board fat so one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

343
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to do in making enclosures you get</font>

344
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,520
the extruded aluminum enclosures this

345
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,530
again I give credit to Dave Jones for

346
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,250
this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get printed circuit boards</font>

347
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:11,680
fabbed to make the front panels of them

348
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,120
now that's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> technique one of the</font>

349
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,040
things that happens if you go to dirty

350
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,690
PCBs though is they'll put<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code number</font>

351
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the front of your board and they do</font>

352
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,150
that for internal tracking purposes ash

353
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,560
Park doesn't do that but dirty does

354
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:25,000
which you know on a board that's going

355
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,189
inside the enclosure I don't really care

356
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">about but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when they put the number right</font>

357
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:33,610
on the front panel of your of your front

358
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,859
panel of your of your enclosure that's

359
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,240
not so nice so now I've got a I love

360
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,070
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have a code number on the</font>

361
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,480
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually shows if I'd have</font>

362
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,800
known that if I to remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at the</font>

363
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,480
time I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have flipped the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gerber's</font>

364
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,760
around so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code number would have</font>

365
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,510
been on the inside of the front panel I

366
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,010
wouldn't have cared so<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

367
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,250
it's an awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff to juggle but</font>

368
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:57,160
try and keep all of those things in mind

369
00:14:53,250 --> 00:15:00,220
when you're when you're working on how

370
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to how to design your your product for</font>

371
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,290
manufacturing that is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so I</font>

372
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,689
guess questions will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be over there and</font>

373
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,180
you can take a look at some of the

374
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:13,240
examples that I brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to see in</font>

375
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,870
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware the lessons that that</font>

376
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,870
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned from them</font>

377
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,710
and big thanks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick for holding out</font>

378
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,149
and actually being the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaker</font>

379
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,010
today I understand the trying to cover

380
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:33,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">dfm in a very short period of time is a</font>

381
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:38,450
pretty amazing and difficult thing to do

382
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,130
so thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hahaha that's right if you</font>

383
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,540
only paid attention to what he just said

384
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:45,320
right there then you should run straight

385
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,490
into production so Nick will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be over</font>

386
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,670
there if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any questions that's</font>

387
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,670
what
