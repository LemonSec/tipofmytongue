<font color="#E5E5E5">cool yeah the crowds been great I've</font>

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,520
seen we got a Hubbard projects going

24
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,080
along all weekend some great demos

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,569
everybody's bringing their own stuff so

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,470
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good I didn't bring anything I</font>

27
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:44,789
traveled here from from Georgia so it

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,369
was a little would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been tough to</font>

29
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:49,140
get a robot<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today Beckham I</font>

30
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,909
think actually probably everyone here

31
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,080
has a lot of experience getting through

32
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:59,819
TSA with robots right if you can you

33
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:01,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">should yeah so Chris and I watched one</font>

34
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,380
of your videos recently where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were</font>

35
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:08,429
blowing up some non-dairy creamer oh

36
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:11,970
yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean when people ask</font>

37
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:15,390
me on have you ever feared for your life

38
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:20,670
on Mythbusters that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that's the moment</font>

39
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:22,200
that I bring up because we the myth was

40
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,540
you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a viral video right</font>

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,988
this guy wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create an explosion</font>

42
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,970
but not use any actual explosives and so

43
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:34,680
one of the ways you can do that which

44
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:36,359
you didn't hear from me is that you take

45
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,319
an air cannon you fill it with non-dairy

46
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:43,829
creamer and or sawdust also works or

47
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,869
sugar and you fired in the air with the

48
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:50,340
road flare and at a certain point like a

49
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,670
granary explosion the stoichiometric

50
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,269
ratio reaches the flashpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the</font>

51
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,339
flare ignites all of that material and

52
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:02,250
it creates like a fireball it's really

53
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,069
cool so we did this with a small air

54
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,920
cannon and a little bit of sawdust and

55
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:10,070
one road flare it work great we thought

56
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,549
well why don't we ramp it up

57
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:16,829
so we got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pallet of non-dairy creamer</font>

58
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,680
which I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you could buy it by</font>

59
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,850
the palette but apparently you can I

60
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,890
think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consume</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough coffee today</font>

61
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,950
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually eat that cereal yeah we'll</font>

62
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:29,549
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have to like get you the</font>

63
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:32,040
URL for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but you put all this</font>

64
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:35,250
non-dairy creamer in a giant hopper huge

65
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,179
air cannon<font color="#E5E5E5"> five flares and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did this</font>

66
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,620
at the bomb range which we you know with

67
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,240
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the show you're never</font>

68
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:49,770
really sure exactly how it's going to go

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:52,530
and initially what happened was that it

70
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:56,190
went boom and it didn't do anything or

71
00:03:52,530 --> 00:04:00,770
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that sucks and then a half</font>

72
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:04,230
second later<font color="#CCCCCC"> it ignited into this huge</font>

73
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:07,110
wall of flame and it was raining down

74
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:10,560
little fiery bits of non-dairy creamer

75
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:13,170
as it was advancing towards us at the

76
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,950
bomb range which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is of course surrounded</font>

77
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:20,180
by dry brush and you know when the bomb

78
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:23,820
tech goes oh that's when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

79
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,020
your head and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like okay but you</font>

80
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,450
know what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

81
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,909
because it's TV and there's a there's a

82
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,070
camera pointed at you it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know</font>

83
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like not a guy with a camera but a</font>

84
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,320
camera on the ground right they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

85
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,380
catch your<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're honest reaction so you</font>

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,540
know running<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not you shouldn't run if</font>

87
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,300
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can because they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see your</font>

88
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">face not your back it's like okay okay</font>

89
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,670
this is really big and so I look back to

90
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:57,390
see you know where Kari and Tory are

91
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:58,680
they're gone oh thanks you guys and a

92
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,630
carries fond of saying well I just

93
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">grabbed you know the first person that</font>

94
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,909
was next to me which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was tori as a human</font>

95
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:09,210
shield and that's where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> went so</font>

96
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:11,940
yeah non-dairy creamer is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing it's</font>

97
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:14,460
a thing it's a thing so you only get one

98
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:18,900
take right you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> get one take and</font>

99
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:21,210
what happens is at the end of that the

100
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,429
bomb range entire surface of bomb range

101
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,310
is coated with this caramelized

102
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:30,630
non-dairy creamer that's formed<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

103
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:35,540
candy crust on the ground it's very very

104
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:38,100
strange sounds really weird yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

105
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,530
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kinds of TV things sound</font>

106
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,330
really hard so you have to make a prop

107
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,429
make the thing work engineered it out

108
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:48,120
and you have to do it really fast that

109
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:51,600
was I think the original concept for the

110
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:56,130
show was to have the host do all the

111
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,160
work so you not only think<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the</font>

112
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:01,680
experiment you build the thing and you

113
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,450
perform<font color="#E5E5E5"> the experiment and in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> early</font>

114
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,630
days of show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would also clean up</font>

115
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:10,080
after the experiment emptying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trash</font>

116
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:12,060
was a part of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract from from the</font>

117
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,140
beginning in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first first five years</font>

118
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,950
of Mythbusters but the you know the

119
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,830
skill set for this is fairly unique and

120
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:25,620
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> person to to be hired on to</font>

121
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,530
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> show was Jamie and that was because</font>

122
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,850
the producer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and creator of the show p</font>

123
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Therese knew that he needed a guy a host</font>

124
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,380
who was capable of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing all these</font>

125
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,130
things and so he had interviewed Jamie

126
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:44,250
for a segment on Robot Wars and he's

127
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,409
like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy he can you know he</font>

128
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,289
can figure this out he can build<font color="#E5E5E5"> it he</font>

129
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:52,830
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it quickly so he got Jamie and</font>

130
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:56,909
then Jamie said well you know he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

131
00:06:52,830 --> 00:07:01,159
so well I that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> good well but I I</font>

132
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:04,500
don't I don't talk that well on camera

133
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,330
but I have a friend who does and so

134
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's how I brought Adam in and they</font>

135
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,789
shot this video but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all come from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

136
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:15,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">special effects background where you</font>

137
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:17,789
constantly have to problem solve and and

138
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,250
figure out things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to be</font>

139
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:24,599
able to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> things very quickly and so</font>

140
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:27,090
that was what the the set of skills that

141
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,279
allowed us to make the show and also you

142
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,260
know being<font color="#E5E5E5"> inquisitive about science and</font>

143
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,520
my backgrounds engineer I mean yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

144
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to adapt a lot when you're when</font>

145
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,430
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of in them</font>

146
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,909
what is what some of your your tips<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

147
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,640
tricks on and like quickly building the

148
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:44,040
proficiency you need in order to make

149
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,539
sure you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get blown up yeah you</font>

150
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,850
know I i have to say because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

151
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:57,330
schedule for Mythbusters we get about a

152
00:07:50,850 --> 00:08:02,370
total<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ten days to make 30 22 minutes</font>

153
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:05,460
of TV and that 10 days is from concept

154
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,460
all the way through execution so it's

155
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a whole lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time and so what I</font>

156
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,390
usually do is try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and fall back on</font>

157
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,890
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've done before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which you</font>

158
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:20,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't do all the time but we reuse a lot</font>

159
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:24,800
of our rigs so you know if I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made</font>

160
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:27,930
a rig to swing a sword<font color="#E5E5E5"> at superhuman</font>

161
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,690
super strength superhuman speed and

162
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,340
strength and so you know at the end of

163
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,409
the day we don't tear that down we put

164
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:38,310
it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shelf and then when we need to</font>

165
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:40,140
swing a hammer at superhuman speed we we

166
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:43,829
whip that out turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on its side and</font>

167
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:48,470
weld a new base so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> never ever throw</font>

168
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:52,140
anything away and if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever needed to</font>

169
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">program a microcontroller I did try so a</font>

170
00:08:52,140 --> 00:09:00,930
lot of time I would go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to what I</font>

171
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:02,790
knew best I would try to teach myself to

172
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,680
you know learn the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino because that</font>

173
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,990
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really the hot thing at the time I</font>

174
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,949
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still the hot thing is still</font>

175
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:15,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hot thing yes but I I would often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

176
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,770
back to my my parallax basic stamp

177
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:23,490
yeah you said you know right<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah hey</font>

178
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:28,530
it worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the protector on galaxy</font>

179
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:32,340
quest the Energizer Bunny r2d2 8-bit

180
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:34,199
reduced instruction set and so but you

181
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,480
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would go back to that to the</font>

182
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,460
things that I knew because I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

183
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,410
time to to do a whole lot a whole lot of

184
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,940
development for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

185
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,010
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you have like a huge jump</font>

186
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,730
in as well you you know are you the

187
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:54,000
standard mines mines more organized<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

188
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,970
you know i have i have the the grave

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,870
install the little plastic transparent

190
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:03,780
plastic drawers I've had that since

191
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,640
since i graduated college so it's still

192
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,530
there still around yeah you have the

193
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,350
same good the same stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> from 20 years</font>

194
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,430
ago 10 years ago oh yeah eventually the

195
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,350
day after you throw it out you're like

196
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,680
oh I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I never throw it out I</font>

197
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:21,750
wouldn't know do you have a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

198
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:24,510
big workshop<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm moving so actor from</font>

199
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,280
the longest time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have</font>

200
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,680
my own personal workshop I actually

201
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,079
lived so when I lived in the bay area I

202
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,770
was over in Oakland at a place called

203
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,750
Peralta studios and I had this law and

204
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,790
it was like wow this great I'm gonna

205
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,270
have this the space that I could build

206
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:45,569
at home and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great concept</font>

207
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:49,410
they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the first time that</font>

208
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:52,680
you cut a piece of wood and it coats

209
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:56,910
every dish that you own in a thin layer

210
00:10:52,680 --> 00:11:00,599
of sawdust or you machine and and you

211
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:04,020
get this oil smell this this thin film

212
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,380
of oil that's so but then I said well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

213
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">gotta shop at work so when i worked at</font>

214
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,580
industrial like magic i had the model

215
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,680
shop and when i worked at Mythbusters I

216
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,370
had that shop and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> after I left</font>

217
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,380
Mythbusters two years ago I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

218
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,890
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> own shop so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the one in my</font>

219
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:26,250
garage which i have now outgrown and I'm

220
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:29,730
moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a slightly larger shop</font>

221
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,380
and that'll be it should be good should

222
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,520
be good but what kind of tools do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

223
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,980
have in that truck I've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> true-blue</font>

224
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">bridgeport series one vertical mill</font>

225
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:43,350
which is you know the my gem I've got

226
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,960
universal laser systems 30 watt laser

227
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">might so the great thing about the laser</font>

228
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:53,490
that I chose is that it's made in

229
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:55,800
America<font color="#E5E5E5"> so not necessarily because you</font>

230
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,440
know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> real hair it's more pragmatic</font>

231
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,849
than that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i have a friend I was</font>

232
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,460
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what should I get you know I can</font>

233
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,650
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Chinese laser for like five grands</font>

234
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,080
like don't do it I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like why it's such</font>

235
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:09,420
a great value because you have a fifty

236
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:13,410
percent chance of that glass laser tube

237
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:15,449
arriving in tact fifty percent point so

238
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,459
he's like don't do it by<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy something</font>

239
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,140
that's made here plus you can get

240
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,710
support courts have<font color="#CCCCCC"> universal laser</font>

241
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,689
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 what my advice to you is even</font>

242
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:28,240
if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that you need more</font>

243
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:33,279
wats by more watts

244
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:37,540
it's gonna bus yeah I could go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

245
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:42,730
time but it's all I've got the laser

246
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:44,349
I've got I've got a MakerBot z18 3d

247
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,080
printer which I've used I've only used

248
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:51,370
twice right so the idea what that was at

249
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time and this was three years ago it</font>

250
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,970
was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest build envelope and I</font>

251
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,660
could build you know I could print

252
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:00,940
something the size of a helmet but I

253
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:05,110
never had the time to actually you know

254
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:07,959
model my iron man helmet and and you

255
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,850
know nowadays I could go and call half a

256
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:12,910
dozen people and get a body scan but you

257
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:16,300
know I didn't have that in those days so

258
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:20,020
I so I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> got around to using it to</font>

259
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:22,300
print my full set of armor I will soon

260
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,520
because you need that right because I

261
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,310
well who doesn't near that in their

262
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,550
lives and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I've only used to build</font>

263
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,949
like to print very small things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

264
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,469
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll i'm hoping once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i get the new</font>

265
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:39,279
shop up and running<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll be printing</font>

266
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:42,520
that the Iron Man armor and the bb-8 is

267
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,610
is on my list so how do you approach

268
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,199
designing a robotics project like that

269
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:50,980
so I'm assuming you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna make a bb8</font>

270
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,190
from scratch yes yes so tell us about so

271
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's gonna work so based on my combat</font>

272
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,790
robot experience and working in

273
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,149
industrial light and magic for nine

274
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:05,290
years like I should easily and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I worked</font>

275
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:09,730
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Artoo's for star wars episodes 1</font>

276
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:14,649
2<font color="#CCCCCC"> and 3 of the dark years yes that's</font>

277
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:16,829
right so based on that I'm like well I I

278
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:19,839
should be able to and I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

279
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:22,989
but then I saw the footage<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

280
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,680
separation Star<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wars Celebration and</font>

281
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,540
there was a bb8 that came and up to that

282
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,750
point I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem like everybody else had</font>

283
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,730
seen the trailer and I assume Oh CJ say

284
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,890
yeah they say that's practical Mark

285
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,900
Hamill said every it was practical I was

286
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,029
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> he must be mistaken because what I</font>

287
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,180
see in that trailer is that's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

288
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:45,260
CG

289
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:49,089
and then at<font color="#E5E5E5"> celebration they rolled out</font>

290
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:52,460
the bb-8<font color="#CCCCCC"> on stage and I lost my mind</font>

291
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:55,730
there's a shot of if you know who Steve

292
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,530
sansweet is one of the foremost Star

293
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,940
Wars memorabilia collectors he also

294
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,819
worked for Lucasfilm for a number of

295
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:07,160
years there's a shot of him going like

296
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:09,740
this like he's like that was exactly

297
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,100
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> felt and i knew at that moment</font>

298
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:16,250
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i needed to build a bb8 for myself</font>

299
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:20,030
course and so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that I would</font>

300
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:22,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it do everything that I saw that</font>

301
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,770
bb-8 do on stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like everything</font>

302
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:28,000
there's there's a half a dozen or more

303
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:31,699
different ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it and after that</font>

304
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,320
everybody had a theory like maybe the

305
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,480
head drives a body that's really silly

306
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,680
don't don't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

307
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:41,450
maybe there's like I remember and the

308
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:46,670
advantage that i have is more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

309
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:49,310
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago Jamie Hyneman the the</font>

310
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:53,209
visionary<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he was had something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

311
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:57,349
did exactly that it was an enclosed

312
00:15:53,210 --> 00:16:00,200
sphere and it was it had drive wheels on

313
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:04,730
the inside but the trick that it had was

314
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:08,330
a spinning flywheel and there's a point

315
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:10,370
where the bb-8 rolls out and it spins in

316
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,020
place when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it do that I said I</font>

317
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,270
know exactly how they're doing it and

318
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,730
it's not how most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

319
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,819
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it it's got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

320
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,920
have a spinning flywheel on the inside

321
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:24,410
so subsequently by the way we use that

322
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,510
same technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jamie's to do a lot of</font>

323
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:29,209
commercials and I come and consult for

324
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:33,170
him one of them we did was a chef

325
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:36,920
boyardee can that jumps off the shelf

326
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:39,199
and follows it's like you know mom was

327
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,500
buying groceries<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she forgets the</font>

328
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,060
chef boyardee can and so in the gag in

329
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,300
the commercials that the can jumps off

330
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,310
the shelf and rolls after her to you

331
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,490
know try and jump in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car and get</font>

332
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,489
eaten

333
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,910
don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it's really make the thing</font>

334
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:59,770
we didn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so but the the neat</font>

335
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,620
thing about the can was that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

336
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:05,319
rolling<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the sidewalk the flywheel</font>

337
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:09,520
was there to help stabilize but also

338
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:11,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">help turn while it was in motion but</font>

339
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,750
with the flywheel on the inside if it

340
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:16,480
started up n it would go into this crazy

341
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,069
like death spiral and it was it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

342
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,670
really weird because you know that the

343
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:25,169
spinning master yeah exactly so so we

344
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:28,600
ended up pulling it on a string for

345
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:31,810
kotas anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> kotas hey there were a</font>

346
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,219
few in there yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> hira can so i mean so</font>

347
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about robots how much of it is</font>

348
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,340
the canticle<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus electrical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

349
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,500
firmware<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i know that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

350
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,449
robots have seen you do are the RC

351
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,940
controlled style but yeah i'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

352
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,380
of moving more into the this self

353
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:49,210
driving style what would what's the deal

354
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:51,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that you know it was in the context</font>

355
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:55,210
of combat robots a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were</font>

356
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:57,940
like well it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great if let's say</font>

357
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:00,610
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> my robot dead blow had this this</font>

358
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:06,310
pickaxe it was a hammer type and income

359
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:07,990
and and peck<font color="#CCCCCC"> your opponents to death but</font>

360
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:10,450
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great if it could trigger</font>

361
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:14,230
itself like if it had an electrosonic

362
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:19,450
yeah proximity sensor or some infrared

363
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:23,170
something like that but in a combat

364
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:25,840
robot context you kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

365
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:29,350
as much control as you possibly can and

366
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was always you know because it is such</font>

367
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,570
a difficult environment there's huge

368
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,430
shocks things like that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to want</font>

369
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:41,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it as simple as possible so i</font>

370
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:46,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">never really used any any self-driving</font>

371
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:50,520
aspects of robotics and that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> project</font>

372
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:53,200
i think that had the most the most

373
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,050
smarts if you can cut that was was

374
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,010
actually Jeff Peterson for the late late

375
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:05,049
show Jeff Peterson is a talking skeleton

376
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:07,989
sidekick for Craig Ferguson and he had a

377
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:12,489
a sequence he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> several sequence 7 in</font>

378
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:14,559
fact of talking and so originally the

379
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:16,690
concept was Craig would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have his talk</font>

380
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,450
show host he would have a box on<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

381
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,529
desk and he would come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the joke</font>

382
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:25,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then say I want Jeff to say this and</font>

383
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:27,460
Jeff would turn to him and say oh that's

384
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:31,238
that's ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> Craig or you know or</font>

385
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,999
balls or something like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

386
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:36,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">were can sequences based on the original</font>

387
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:39,389
seven phrases that gave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so i</font>

388
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:45,090
programmed a microcontroller another

389
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:48,428
basic stamp<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and it that one had a</font>

390
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:50,830
servo driver attached to it so I could

391
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:56,320
send like seven or eight servos tell

392
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:57,850
them what to do but with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

393
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,189
couldn't he couldn't change his

394
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,230
movements but he could change the voice

395
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:05,109
samples and so every week what they

396
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:07,149
would do is come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with seven new</font>

397
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:10,989
phrases and Craig wouldn't know what

398
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:12,908
they were and so yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Frank on</font>

399
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:15,999
someone well and and there would be a

400
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:18,609
guy off stage and so first they had a

401
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:21,100
box right that instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having it on</font>

402
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:24,279
his desk the guy of stage had the boxing

403
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:26,830
at the seven buttons and then they had a

404
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,769
box with a longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> cord they like okay</font>

405
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:32,080
can you make the cord longer like yeah

406
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:34,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay can you make it Wireless and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

407
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,289
like okay I can I can do that and so I

408
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:41,499
had to to glue together an ethernet

409
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:44,289
interface into a router jeff had a

410
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:47,889
wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> router on him and he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had an and</font>

411
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:51,039
then the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rider off stage had an ipad</font>

412
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:53,649
that he had and I i found i<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot the</font>

413
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,379
protocol was but was for<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> djs</font>

414
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:58,529
used for live events like they would I

415
00:20:56,379 --> 00:21:04,988
don't know control their video displays

416
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:07,769
these different buttons and and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

417
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:10,690
was about as intelligent get some robots

418
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:12,909
as intelligent as a robot<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scott for me</font>

419
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,369
that's good though yeah I mean I like to

420
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:16,570
maintain control over them right lest

421
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:24,549
they

422
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:26,019
they lead to 2 to salvation day how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

423
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:29,710
different projects do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on at the</font>

424
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:32,139
same time um these days I've got a few

425
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the shelf I've got the spider which I</font>

426
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:37,209
think there's a picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over over</font>

427
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,678
there on that poster that one's that

428
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,509
one's been on the shelf for a while

429
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,730
there's the BBA it's still an active

430
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:45,429
project when we were working on

431
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:48,370
Mythbusters we do three projects at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

432
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:50,649
same time because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you never know if</font>

433
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:53,469
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into some kind of</font>

434
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:55,539
roadblock or something like that like if

435
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't get a location if you can't</font>

436
00:21:55,539 --> 00:22:00,908
get the materials if your expert isn't

437
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,639
available and so you jump on to another

438
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:08,350
project and and wait for that to come so

439
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:10,090
it's uh it's I I try not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do more than</font>

440
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,639
three projects at a time because<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

441
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:15,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">too much things fall by the wayside like</font>

442
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:19,090
I have my own personal r2d2 that has

443
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:21,759
been as I think we're going on 15 years

444
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:24,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">now and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is that if I don't</font>

445
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> front of me sitting on</font>

446
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:29,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bench I forget about it so i think i</font>

447
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:33,340
forgot that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had all the parts to do my</font>

448
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,769
own are two for about six years but i'll

449
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,789
get back to it what will you do with it

450
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:43,450
when it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> done drive it around my living</font>

451
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:48,220
room like everybody look at it in and

452
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:50,250

453
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,250
happy

454
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,660
that's what we call a happiness machine

455
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,180
I think there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people here who</font>

456
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,980
can relate to that yeah you know back in

457
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,980
the day when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to work at</font>

458
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:06,880
Industrial Light magic one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my gigs</font>

459
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:09,370
was to drive the the real r2 d2's for

460
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,530
commercials and personal appearances in

461
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:18,489
addition I I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> dressed up as c-3po</font>

462
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:20,320
which I have pictures<font color="#E5E5E5"> no it's real real</font>

463
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,260
i was actually the right size I was a

464
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,860
little shorter than Anthony Daniels but

465
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:31,780
essentially the right size but so what

466
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:34,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">they would do is have people who are</font>

467
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,160
already employees who are already

468
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,540
covered by the non-disclosure agreement

469
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,360
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they they knew they could</font>

470
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:43,050
trust perform these characters and I had

471
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,179
the added advantage as<font color="#CCCCCC"> an engineer and</font>

472
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:49,320
someone who's mechanically inclined to

473
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:54,330
to work on our<font color="#CCCCCC"> to if anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happened</font>

474
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:57,669
so back then we had official<font color="#E5E5E5"> r2 d2's</font>

475
00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:01,060
that were the ones from the movies that

476
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,770
if you had to have an appearance<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

477
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:05,139
there was a theater opening or Burger

478
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,550
King commercial or Taco Bell one of them

479
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:09,060

480
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:11,620
actually happened with the Taco Bell<font color="#E5E5E5"> dog</font>

481
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,889
talk about who is treated<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way</font>

482

488
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:39,039
the executives not so much but you know

489
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:43,370
nowadays when they have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> appearance</font>

491
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:49,279

492
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,820
had enough time that they are really

493
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,649
really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of them you didn't hear</font>

494
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:58,010
it from me are better than once we use

495
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:59,479
in the movies they do more than they do

496
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,490
in the movies so it's one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

497
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,159
work when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're working on a movie you</font>

498
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:06,049
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the luxury of saying okay in the</font>

499
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,440
next scene we need the fire extinguisher

500
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:11,408
so you swap out the arm that comes out

501
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">and put in the fire extinguisher and</font>

502
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:18,260
you're done in in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> movies it seems</font>

503
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:20,360
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> r2 can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do dozens of different</font>

00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,330
things you can chew lightsaber he's got

505

the fan belt<font color="#CCCCCC"> Artoo's can actually do a</font>

508
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:36,370
lot of those things all at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

509
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:41,000
in the movies we used to cheat a lot so

510
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:43,789
nowadays they they hire locally whatever

511
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,950
our tues they can because there are

512
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:47,809
they're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good and there are</font>

513
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:50,659
builders all over the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

514
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:55,639
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world who are more than happy</font>

515
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:57,620
to work for cheap I'm fun projects unfun

516
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,020
projects yes so you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a lot of</font>

517
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,459
projects with other people can you talk

518
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,309
a little bit about collaboration and

519
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:07,190
what how that works<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

520
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:11,539
collaboration is neat you know it's I

521
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:14,240
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to to fight against the idea</font>

522
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:15,830
that my way is the right way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

523
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,380
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people in everybody has to go</font>

524
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:20,360
through that but really<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are so</font>

525
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:24,409
many different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to do things and so</font>

526
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:26,360
I find that if I open up to hearing

527
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:28,190
other ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing things a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

528
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,850
times I'll learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> something a trick that</font>

529
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:34,850
I didn't know before which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

530
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:38,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun collaborating is great it's it's</font>

531
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:41,360
best done when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a communication</font>

532
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:43,309
chain that is robust like you're in the

533
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">same room it's tough</font>

534
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:47,658
you have to collaborate with people on

535
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:50,029
the other side of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and</font>

536
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:52,879
different time zones which we we have

537
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:56,929
done a lot on unmet Buster's for example

538

541
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:11,269
ideas is best done when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were building</font>

542
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:15,439
things for Mythbusters we would have

543
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:17,330
meetings to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we need to make</font>

544
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">this thing and it seems like on the show</font>

545
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:21,350
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you come up with on</font>

546
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:23,899
the at the spur of the moment but really

547
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,969
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you we have a</font>

548
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:27,529
meeting ahead of time usually at the

549
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,840
beginning of the season like several

550
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:33,139
weeks ahead because that way we can

551
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,029
order materials and and they arrive in

552
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:38,658
time for us to do our 2-week build on

553
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:41,269
each thing yeah so working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

554
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:43,850
is a skill just like designing and

555
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:45,499
building things is a skill and it's a

556
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,779
skill that you have to continue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

557
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:49,100
on if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

558
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,539

560
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:54,860
stuff like that we saw the autonomous

561
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:57,649
car stuff oh yeah that's pretty cool I

562
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,629
got to drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> around in a DeLorean a time</font>

563
00:27:57,649 --> 00:28:02,119
machine like a fully done time machine

568
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:16,460
because it was a car of the future kind

569

themselves and so it's like you know

571
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,350
this was and we filmed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it was just</font>

572
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:29,110
weeks before the software update

573
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:32,360
happened for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tesla and so so</font>

574
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:34,428
unfortunately mine mine isn't like i

575
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,619
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Tesla and I got the software</font>

576
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:38,779
update but the self-driving is kind of

577
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:41,360
grayed out so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know there's any</font>

578
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:44,690
Tesla people here there are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> good I</font>

579
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:49,668
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> your help you're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

580
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:54,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">P</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 80-85 d has the yeah yeah yeah it's</font>

581
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:56,240
scary<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good um come see me after but</font>

582
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:56,559
the idea was that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know with with the</font>

583
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,789
mouth

584
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:03,908
jerk EIT segments we would go around and

585
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:06,580
just explore cool things that engineers

586
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:10,539
were doing so I went to Carnegie Mellon

587
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:13,090
and did a segment on robotics and I went

588
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:14,889
to actually went I work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Star Trek</font>

589
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:18,158
web series called Star Trek continues

590
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:21,580
and we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Star Trek set but</font>

591
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,980
then we brought in people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the guy</font>

592
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:26,620
who's the head of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mars one and I talked</font>

593
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:29,830
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my friend Bobak Ferdowsi who's the</font>

594
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:32,379
NASA mohawk guy and so we try and and

595
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:35,379
incorporate all these these cool

596
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:37,629
concepts that that engineers that you

597
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:39,519
know as an engineer I would think was

598
00:29:37,629 --> 00:29:41,289
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so they kind of give me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

599
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">rein to go around and and go to these</font>

600
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:50,529
places and talk to different people

601
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:51,939
about all these cool things oh did I get

602
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:53,019
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn did I get to learn about what</font>

603
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:58,830
kind of technology is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

604
00:29:53,019 --> 00:30:01,980
self-driving cars yeah d I don't know

605
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:05,649
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years um</font>

606
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:08,740
there the guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was talking to from</font>

607
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:12,158
cab co which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canadian advocacy</font>

608
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,929
group for self-driving vehicles we

609
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,029
talked about the different things and he

610
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:20,220
said actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really interesting thing</font>

611
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:23,679
which was fascinating me and that is a

612
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,360
skilled group of graduate students could

613
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,149
assemble all the components<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

614
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,668
need for a self-driving car immediately

615
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:32,049
today just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like just the component</font>

616
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:36,429
you're saying like light on 90 you get

617
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:38,408
nicer<font color="#CCCCCC"> center</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the way yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lidar GPS</font>

618
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:41,409
all those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you get ninety percent</font>

619
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:44,590
of the way it's the last ten percent

620
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:46,990
that kills you<font color="#E5E5E5"> as with any project or</font>

621
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:50,110
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that last ten percent yeah</font>

622
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:52,539
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the software it's a software</font>

623
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,789
and making that you know you could have

624
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:57,940
all the cameras all the image

625
00:30:54,789 --> 00:31:00,220
recognition all of the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> latte our</font>

626
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:04,360
data but without the software to sort it

627
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:06,440
all out it's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what yeah</font>

628
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:11,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">you still got a big challenge ahead</font>

629
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:13,970
yeah so soon though soon various yeah

630
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,320
yeah so was there<font color="#E5E5E5"> something there about</font>

631
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,899
retrofits as well so like the other

632
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,519
thing we'd heard about retrofits that is

633
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:21,799
that what you mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by having grad</font>

634
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,149
students do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean this would be I</font>

635
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:26,990
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he was talking about so</font>

636
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:31,580
there's a there's a believe it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Audi</font>

637
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:35,000
that they they have a kit that you can

638
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:37,668
you can add to your vehicle to to make

639
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,740
it enable it to be self driving but no

640
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:41,629
he was talking about any car right okay

641
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,120
any car it wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be it wouldn't be</font>

642
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:45,649
pretty you'd have you'd have all the

643
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,439
stuff hanging off of it much like the

644
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:51,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">time machine Gloria but it would have</font>

645
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:55,129
all of the elements that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you needed in</font>

646
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:57,529
order to achieve self-driving well I

647
00:31:55,129 --> 00:32:01,100
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually out of time already</font>

648
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:03,230
