00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,950
the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that make the world and make</font>

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,990
emerging technology more accessible

23
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,200
understandable and available to

24
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,589
everybody and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through my</font>

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,049
talk is in two parts I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font>

26
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,420
click the slide here and say about me

27
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,630
the first part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be going</font>

28
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,130
through a bit of strong opinions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

29
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:02,399
that I've sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of developed over the</font>

30
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,759
last<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years my training is as as a</font>

31
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,829
sort of critical artist and a critical

32
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,449
engineer for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last decade I've been</font>

33
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,690
doing consulting or engineering or

34
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">artworks for money and and for fun I</font>

35
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,150
chose this<font color="#E5E5E5"> photo</font>

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,210
because this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

37
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">fablab ever set up at NASA I got this is</font>

38
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,330
the most government money I've ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

39
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,040
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend and the photo is really</font>

40
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,870
blurry and surreptitious because I

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,910
learned during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the taking of this photo</font>

42
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,850
that photography was not allowed because

43
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,100
it's in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a massive CNC</font>

44
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,579
machine factory at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Goddard Space</font>

45
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,280
Flight Facility so surreptitious photo

46
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,140
this is me<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years ago this is one of</font>

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first one of the first things I made</font>

48
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,390
that that became publicly available

49
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,700
someone from a blog picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> this up from</font>

50
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">my flickr feed these are Hulk hands that</font>

51
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">I outfitted for MIDI I did a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

52
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,649
electronic interactive media performance

53
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,330
and so part of the part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Act at</font>

54
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,010
this point was hooking these up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

55
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,470
dope drum machine and punching out a

56
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,810
beat and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually one of the</font>

57
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,320
first projects of mind that was publicly

58
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,630
seen and the flickr photo set was a far

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">cry from the documentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i see and</font>

60
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,079
expected admire in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world now and</font>

61
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's going to be the second part of</font>

62
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the talk is ways i'm ways i'm trying to</font>

63
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,730
trying to emulate the documentation i

64
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,340
see i<font color="#CCCCCC"> like most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world but for me</font>

65
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,410
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit a little</font>

66
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,320
bit of shop I'm actually just going to

67
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,350
show the storage solutions that I like

68
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,230
the most and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assert are the</font>

69
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,299
canonically best storage solutions so

70
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,519
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make a project particularly if</font>

71
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,310
you do this even<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the side for money</font>

72
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,170
it's really important to be able to to

73
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,180
sort of get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right tool quickly to</font>

74
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,359
understand what your inventory is to

75
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,310
have a well-organized shop and I'm not

76
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,640
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who naturally organizes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

77
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,890
over time I've come to really appreciate

78
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,839
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flow the the additional</font>

79
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:01,109
serenity you can feel if you really do

80
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,420
know your inventory well and so I like

81
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:08,550
to organize these containers by two

82
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:10,859
metrics one is spectrum so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

83
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,780
my wireless equipment shows up in one

84
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,810
bin I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you you might think you</font>

85
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,180
should split out into ble and Wi-Fi and

86
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,010
and ham radio or SDR stuff it's all

87
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,380
small enough to fit in one bin and it's

88
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,020
a transparent bin so I generally really

89
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,070
I much appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess if i go to</font>

90
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,940
back you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see there's also</font>

91
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:34,060
mol down there audio inductive coils and

92
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,370
circle shaped things optical and photo

93
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,410
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I organized by spectrum and this is</font>

94
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,510
sensors and actuators can be grouped

95
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,150
together this just happens to be the way

96
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,469
that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> features or</font>

97
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,570
functions I might want to add to a

98
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,630
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> so being able to really quickly</font>

99
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:52,540
get to get to the band the spectrum<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

100
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,360
trying to address is it's generally a

101
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,410
nice way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid sort of losing 10</font>

102
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,060
minutes losing even two minutes

103
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,340
searching in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own shop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for something</font>

104
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,770
which always feels a little crazy the

105
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:07,179
second way I organize objects is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's by</font>

106
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:09,159
sort of fungible spend ability so if I

107
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,130
have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I expect permanently to</font>

108
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,870
embed in a place so<font color="#CCCCCC"> connectors that I</font>

109
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,159
will permanently embed somewhere are

110
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,980
different than connectors that I might

111
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,650
reuse so and they're also sort of

112
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,720
grouped by group by amperage or grouped

113
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,659
by the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of durability of connections</font>

114
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,610
so i'll keep my waterproof or my ip66

115
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,880
connectors in a different place than my

116
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,710
jumpers<font color="#E5E5E5"> but again that's because really</font>

117
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,110
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for a part I'm not</font>

118
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,430
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the part number the name</font>

119
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,140
or anything like that i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

120
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,210
what part of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm trying to</font>

121
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,979
address is this fixturing is this an

122
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,770
interface between inside and outside is

123
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,660
this is this something that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

124
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:51,460
going to embed permanently in a project

125
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:55,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">or or not and so this is the best one to</font>

126
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:58,299
buy this is the the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 2 X with 1</font>

127
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:00,880
i'll post these on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter i have</font>

128
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,380
links to these as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 1</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x1</font>

129
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,450
I like these<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're washable</font>

130
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,200
they're reusable this is about two bucks

131
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:10,030
per box they stack their modular you can

132
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,770
stack like six or<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven of them even if</font>

133
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're heavy and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> won't topple over</font>

134
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,450
and so that's that's what i use you've

135
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,130
seen them in the wire shelving as well

136
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,110
I've seen a lot of wire shelving in

137
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,300
people shop photos here I quite I quite

138
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great this</font>

139
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">container this is the result of quite a</font>

140
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,760
long search for something that is

141
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,950
compact but that also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can take these</font>

142
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,230
bins out of so if I'm soldering I can

143
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,729
take one of these bins out that has you

144
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,590
know my micro switches are my limit

145
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,990
switches or whatever and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on the</font>

146
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,789
desk with me close up<font color="#CCCCCC"> this box again</font>

147
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,920
parent top is really useful just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

148
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:48,040
can visually see inventory without

149
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,870
having to read or write labels and it's

150
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,150
also super cheap so this this is where I

151
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,690
keep all of my sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finger-sized or</font>

152
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,429
smaller items and in terms of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

153
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:01,270
organize the actual things I'm working

154
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:03,610
on I really try to be unafraid to have

155
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,229
excess storage capacity if something

156
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,540
seems like it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something even</font>

157
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll return one time to if it's not</font>

158
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,470
something I'm making in one shot I'll

159
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,450
give it a bin and this leads to the

160
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,640
corollary about storage containers which

161
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:18,159
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always helpful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

162
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,229
thirty percent empty storage containers

163
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,210
I live by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this rule it is worth the</font>

164
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">money particularly with these cheap bins</font>

165
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:28,150
if you have excess capacity that makes

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,160
it so much easier to to make a new bin

167
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,989
for something to make a bin for a

168
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">project that even again might seem like</font>

169
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,860
a one offer or a sort of flutter so if

170
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,480
it's if it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it might be a</font>

171
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,460
thing you'll come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

172
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,100
own bin and put all the parts in that

173
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,989
bin if you know pick out the right

174
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,180
resistor values put a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra in</font>

175
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,220
there and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just have this one</font>

176
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,420
box that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> take out and work on</font>

177
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,790
the project without having to search

178
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,280
around a lot and I know this might sound

179
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,560
super OCD but if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

180
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,539
distractible or if you're doing this

181
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,130
very late at night it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> pays to</font>

182
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,320
just have these systems in place that

183
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that really lower the friction to to</font>

184
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:09,520
creating and speaking of distractible

185
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:12,580
I'm guilty more and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sometimes</font>

186
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,430
you know having my focus diffuse and so

187
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,560
I realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know if I</font>

188
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,540
can't answer the question where is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

189
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,300
next actual dopamine release in a

190
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,680
project coming from I lose it I don't I

191
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,350
don't I don't come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to that project</font>

192
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,720
I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a laser galvanometers project it</font>

193
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,310
was open loop and it's lost in the

194
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,260
wilderness now I have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it</font>

195
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">would take for that to yield any sort of</font>

196
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,010
a win and here you have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> generous</font>

197
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,800
with yourself even you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I've set up</font>

198
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,120
a stepper motors many times getting a

199
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,969
stepper motor spinning is still fun to

200
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,860
me I'm still willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call to call you</font>

201
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,780
know hooking up the OLED to the Arduino

202
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,990
to the stepper that's still a win to me

203
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,819
I I you know should be beyond such small

204
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,260
thrills but the fact is that I still

205
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">really get a kick out of these things</font>

206
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

207
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,600
no myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I know how I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can engineer a</font>

208
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,550
product project how I can decompose a

209
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,070
really daunting thing like fix this

210
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,349
really crap laser cutter how I can

211
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,300
decompose that into a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

212
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,850
win that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets me</font>

213
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,829
dopamine within three days then I know

214
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,110
no matter how long or daunting the

215
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:18,310
project is I can I can see it through

216
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,959
and knowing how to finish a project is

217
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,060
also something that I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

218
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:25,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at I certainly wasn't very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

219
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,239
at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years ago now now I try to</font>

220
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out maybe in one sentence exactly</font>

221
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,320
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will take for me to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> satisfied</font>

222
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,360
in this particular creative or

223
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,089
engineering inquiry so if I can figure

224
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,649
out you know well once I am able to for

225
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,020
example peer directly through the

226
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">thermal sensor and see what it sees that</font>

227
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,310
will be enough for me phrasing the

228
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,610
problem like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really helps me avoid</font>

229
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:51,189
yak shaving I<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would know that</font>

230
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,899
term okay it helps me<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid sort of</font>

231
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,940
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost in the woods or adding or</font>

232
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,310
succumbing to feature creep so really

233
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">try and have one sentence that sort of</font>

234
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,489
expresses exactly what you would like to

235
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">have happen with the time you're</font>

236
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,570
spending on a project<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that that to</font>

237
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,130
me is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful and that gets into</font>

238
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,920
the last of the first section which is

239
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we organize how I organize my time I</font>

240
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,990
try to be really generous with myself

241
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,209
because I'm at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not watching</font>

242
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,579
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kardashians so even puttering around</font>

243
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:21,670
on sunday morning and sweeping the shop

244
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:23,290
even even something like labeling a bin

245
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,699
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really know what's in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

246
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">put a label on it like wireless</font>

247
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,620
something really obvious even that

248
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,240
counts even<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've trained myself to</font>

249
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,649
recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a little bit of</font>

250
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,829
dopamine there there's a little bit of a

251
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:37,510
little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sort of spatial hygiene</font>

252
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:40,029
there that's my puttering slide sorry

253
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,339
and I'll go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say if you're doing</font>

254
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:43,390
this at all for money you know maybe

255
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:45,550
you're helping an artist get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

256
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,620
installation ready maybe you're you know

257
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,050
trying to start a hardware startup but

258
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,820
what not as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start a project</font>

259
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,589
as soon as the bin is opened make a

260
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,570
google doc and just write down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the times</font>

261
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:57,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a million time</font>

262
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,500
tracking apps but a google doc is a

263
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,900
really central place for me to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

264
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,079
and audit my time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this really helps</font>

265
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">me get better at estimating I'm guilty</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

267
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,020
I think 5x off with the NASA Fab Lab on

268
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,140
how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I thought it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would take to</font>

269
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,970
get up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and running and so the more you</font>

270
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,040
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these little habits that that</font>

271
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,650
you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pay yourself in dopamine to</font>

272
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,240
adopt thank you the more you have that

273
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,220
the more you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> better more quickly</font>

274
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then you'll start recognizing when</font>

275
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,310
you have these moments of flow and

276
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,110
you'll do a thing like put together a

277
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,810
whole project<font color="#CCCCCC"> over one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sunday and</font>

278
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,920
realize like damn you know last year I

279
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,260
would have gotten totally sidetracked

280
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,160
with the simpsons<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that or you know</font>

281
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would have I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have found</font>

282
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,730

being able to to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to structure</font>

285
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,700
and recognize the rewards you set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

286
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,719
yourself helps you keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

287
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,210
particularly if you struggle with

288
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,430
depression or a DD or other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

289
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">might keep you might keep you from being</font>

290
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,780
as productive as you are sometimes being

291
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,130
able to normalize that productivity is

292
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,680
really something you can do for yourself

293
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,880
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is worth thinking about so</font>

294
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,620
this next<font color="#E5E5E5"> section I'm going to go</font>

295
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,660
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of projects of mine</font>

296
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,760
that are both successes and failures

297
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,930
their successes because they totally

298
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,210
exist and they're in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation</font>

299
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:13,510
and their failures because not one of

300
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:17,070
you has made these things not to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

301
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,730
finger but clearly clearly something

302
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,050
something that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the next step</font>

303
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,490
for me something that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

304
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,699
wonderful about the hackaday Prize last

305
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,140
year was realizing that I'm with this

306
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">wonderful community that I can actually</font>

307
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,790
address on equal terms I actually could

308
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,340
I could hope that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you would try</font>

309
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a thing so fixture is an</font>

310
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,140
installation I made last year this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

311
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,849
actually just in my house but I still I

312
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,800
still make critical art objects and this

313
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,320
this was just a way to try and think

314
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,170
about the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of easy surrogacy with</font>

315
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,180
which my phone is allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace my</font>

316
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,939
presence<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google thinks that where my</font>

317
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,280
mobile is is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there you</font>

318
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">know right almost all the time Fitbit</font>

319
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,970
sort of surrogates accelerometer

320
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,590
activity to my activity but you've seen

321
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,870
it thrown in the home depot paint

322
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,780
shakers and used to sort of spoof itself

323
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:08,140
so I wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to make a really taut</font>

324
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:11,199
line between exactly where my phone was

325
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,120
and some display in my house so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

326
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,270
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a continuous mapping between</font>

327
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,540
my phone's accelerometer values X maps

328
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:21,449
to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Y maps to gz map</font>

329
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,880
to be there's just a really simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

330
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,730
know a linear interpolation going on and

331
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,250
then those 60<font color="#E5E5E5"> LEDs represent one minute</font>

332
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:33,510
in the past for 60 minutes so i hope

333
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:35,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">this auto plays maybe maybe that okay so</font>

334
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,230
here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see my phone going through</font>

335
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,850
a different a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

336
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,860
postures so you can see times a day when

337
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> walking times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day when I sit still</font>

338
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,510
for a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time but already I did it</font>

339
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,100
right I I<font color="#CCCCCC"> matano mais dice I made my</font>

340
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,420
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> a surrogate for my own presence</font>

341
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,250
and so I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have this</font>

342
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,979
installation around just to sort of

343
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:55,110
pluck that wire between where I am where

344
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,140
my phone is and what we're seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

345
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,660
display this project is all on github

346
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,010
and I wouldn't blame you for not trying

347
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,689
to implement it because you have to want

348
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,310
to write your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own server you have to run</font>

349
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,470
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write your on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Android app you</font>

350
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,780
have to want to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the first the</font>

351
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">v0 of spark core which is what this runs</font>

352
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,470
on which was rub much rougher than

353
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,790
particle and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that what i</font>

354
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,950
learned from this and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i learned</font>

355
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:20,160
from the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of non adaptation of this</font>

356
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,530
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a wide scope for</font>

357
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,060
kind of a niche purpose it really is you

358
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:27,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answering a pretty esoteric</font>

359
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:30,449
critical question of my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry and</font>

360
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,310
also really broad spectrum making so you

361
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,430
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a full stack</font>

362
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:37,619
thing by yourself to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to look</font>

363
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,989
into this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I learned that even</font>

364
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,730
harder last year I was lucky enough to

365
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,830
be one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hackaday prize</font>

366
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,870
semi-finalists with my my thermal camera

367
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,730
that was bluetooth for enabled so this

368
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,440
was this project where I really just

369
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,410
wanted to see through another sensors

370
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,840
eyes and this the sensor this beautiful

371
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:58,610
rectangular thing by Panasonic called

372
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,990
grid I is forty dollars on digikey and

373
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,340
it was a relatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy thing to put</font>

374
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">together it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some passives in an</font>

375
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:08,430
RF tween oh and an oled screen on the

376
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:10,230
back and and this also isn't really

377
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,900
reproducible what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I learned so it was</font>

378
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,720
amazing to have the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hackaday</font>

379
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,000
audience look look to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

380
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,260
made and the pressure was really on to

381
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,360
make something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everyone could</font>

382
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,910
reproduce and I really failed in that

383
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,830
regard because it took me three tries to

384
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">get this sensor mailed to me it's still</font>

385
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,340
covered under ITAR and I didn't quite

386
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,560
understand the forms I was filling<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

387
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,400
when you asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy it from digikey so</font>

388
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,079
I kept under

389
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,329
occupation I kept angrily writing US

390
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,060
citizen and eventually I had to sort of

391
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:41,100
i had to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know use my day job</font>

392
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,599
as like cover to get this sensor and so

393
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,070
I realized midway through the contest

394
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,780
nobody can get this thing without<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

395
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,310
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gaming the system a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit I</font>

396
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better now I'm not</font>

397
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure and the other side of it was that I</font>

398
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,490
talked before about scoping a project or

399
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,410
having a sentence that describes when

400
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,360
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be satisfied I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of got</font>

401
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,400
satisfied before I did the heavy

402
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,760
graphics<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android app that displays the</font>

403
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,230
ble info so I never made that and a lot

404
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,550
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I'll get the</font>

405
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,480
emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're following the</font>

406
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:11,280
project now I'm real sorry guys it's not

407
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,620
gonna happen i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> android very</font>

408
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,390
much and I'm certainly not good at

409
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,330
graphic so there's no not a lot of

410
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,410
dopamine left there but hey it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

411
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,960
open source you should you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

412
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,579
contribute to the project<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

413
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,670
skip by this one this was like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> super</font>

414
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,950
niche jog dial a one axis stepper

415
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,339
controller to aim to help focus my laser

416
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:34,350
I learned much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this project</font>

417
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:37,080
which i completed and have been making a

418
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,820
bunch of this is a simple Qi charger

419
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,460
really like wireless charging it's one

420
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,690
of the best sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of improvements in</font>

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,780

422
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:47,070
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of under under hyped</font>

423
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,630
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> very kind asked me to write this</font>

424
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">up for a blog post and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

425
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:53,550
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool I would love to you know I</font>

426
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,130
sort of got excited and wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven</font>

427
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,949
verbose pages of documentation and I

428
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:02,370
took 20 gigabytes of photos and I didn't

429
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:04,500
check them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their garbage so I have</font>

430
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,030
these messy photos of me way in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

431
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">of my shop a lot of them are out of</font>

432
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,680
focus and it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> not clear even</font>

433
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,630
though I did the thing right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had three</font>

434
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,310
cameras on me for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire weekend</font>

435
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,370
that I was building two of these I

436
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,839
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wasn't checking my shots and I</font>

437
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,489
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> hadn't for example made a</font>

438
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,349
storyboard of the story I want to tell

439
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,920
of the building so the thing I learned

440
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:28,020
from this is I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'm in my</font>

441
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,610
future projects i will try to just have

442
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,800
verbs<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a photo</font>

443
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,199
showing very unambiguously very cleanly

444
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,240
very close up exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what verb to do</font>

445
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,170
next to finish<font color="#CCCCCC"> the project or to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

446
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next step and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't publish these</font>

447
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,580
20 gigs of photos for obvious reasons

448
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,280
but I'll happy to show you them if you

449
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,280
want

450
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to end on a project</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

451
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,760
just released last night and this

452
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:54,340
actually dovetails really well with the

453
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,080
awesome haptics talk we just heard I've

454
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,199
been really interested in electro

455
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,000
vibration this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a way to use a low</font>

456
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,040
current high voltage signal to

457
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,890
dynamically change the apparent texture

458
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,899
of a flat surface which sounds crazy and

459
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,580
is a feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've never felt before I</font>

460
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,900
was reading I read<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Disney</font>

461
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,669
research papers that come out because

462
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're awesome and there were two</font>

463
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,690
really frustrating papers that describe

464
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,000
this totally magic new feeling in the

465
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,710
world and then didn't really go through

466
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,990
the implementation of such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling in</font>

467
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,790
very much detail they had a photo of the

468
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,830
board that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have now blown up and</font>

469
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,149
printed out like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

470
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">i spent a little time trying to reverse</font>

471
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,840
engineer this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought this is</font>

472
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,280
a place where i can make a contribution

473
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,350
and you know maybe add a new sort of

474
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,300
sort of haptic sensing to the general

475
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,399
hackaday vocabulary so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying very</font>

476
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this project which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i again i</font>

477
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,390
released last night go check it out I'm

478
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,430
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this project</font>

479
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,350
much more accessible and actually

480
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:52,660
implementable and it'll be the greatest

481
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:55,000
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my my 2015 if I saw any extras</font>

482
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these in the wild so on the left you</font>

483
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,570
can see the first board that i made the

484
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:03,940
idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn this pot to change the</font>

485
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,710
apparent frequency these this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where</font>

486
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,050
the the texture sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes I</font>

487
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,090
brought one so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> try it out it's a</font>

488
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,800
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> subtle because I really need help</font>

489
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:15,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the current sensing feedback part</font>

490
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,830
and so hackaday come come to my rescue

491
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,690
but already it's a pretty weird

492
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,780
sensation you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get it to go from sort</font>

493
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">of sticky to sort of waxy to sort of</font>

494
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,280
sand papery and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i'm really</font>

495
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,740
selling it now but it's really quite an

496
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,030
uncanny<font color="#E5E5E5"> and an interesting feeling and i</font>

497
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,510
think is an interesting counterpoint to

498
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:36,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">to pretty battery heavy haptic vibration</font>

499
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:39,370
strategies this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to sort of</font>

500
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the texture in a more passive way</font>

501
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,179
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of pull pull instead of</font>

502
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notified this is the second version</font>

503
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,120
of the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is bluetooth for</font>

504
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,220
enabled and there really is a nap I did

505
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,379
you can you can totally download an

506
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android app and and address this this is</font>

507
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,690
much smaller and is made to be embedded

508
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:57,070
but that's that's kind of the trajectory

509
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,330
I wanted to go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to start</font>

510
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,178
some arguments about

511
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,250
my opinions about containers and and how

512
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:06,070
I organize projects and then I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

513
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,480
to really try to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving back to</font>

514
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,490
the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> from which I've gotten so</font>

515
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,309
much so thank you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much for</font>

516
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:15,330
listening and I'd love to talk further

517
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,330
over there thank you
