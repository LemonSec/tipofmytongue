there was always one group with a lot of

this fundamental drive to profit from

under the guise of access so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

145
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:34,600
very specific breakout board that I had

146
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,630
run across this year when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> teaching</font>

147
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,910
and I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> originally given my students</font>

148
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ic's and some of them went to look</font>

149
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,940
up the data sheets and they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

150
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,590
and they're like oh no do we need the

151
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,969
sparkfun piece they were very very

152
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,700
confused and they thought they needed to

153
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:52,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">buy this sparkman board this is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

154
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:54,550
74 HC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 595 shift register there's nothing</font>

155
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,430
fancy about it they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it on a PCB</font>

156
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,890
board and in fact they kind of rerouted

157
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,860
the pins so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually less clear</font>

158
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,060
where they're out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual I see</font>

159
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,360
they're charging two dollars and

160
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,060
ninety-five cents for this okay by the

161
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:15,400
time you get that imported into England

162
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,980
that's two pounds 42<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay however if we</font>

163
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,409
order this from China with free shipping

164
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:24,580
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 of them for one pound</font>

165
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:27,289
five that's six p h there's no

166
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,119
additional engineering on this PCB board

167
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:32,330
so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the</font>

168
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:35,479
economic<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of this what is the</font>

169
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,729
economic cost the environmental cost of

170
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,039
taking a chip shipping of fruit in china

171
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:42,889
shipping it to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US producing a piece</font>

172
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">be be bored putting the chip on the PCB</font>

173
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,129
board selling it back to England and

174
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:49,460
then shipping<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to someone in England</font>

175
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:51,669
that's just absurd so what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

176
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:55,008
economic barrier we have going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here</font>

177
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:57,080
so employment in computer systems in

178
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:59,330
design industries so this was a nice

179
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,568
statistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found that just showed the</font>

180
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,248
rise of design and computing jobs in the

181
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,039
United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States I'm sure in other</font>

182
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:07,749
countries this graph is very similar

183
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,430
technological jobs are<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the rise</font>

184
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:14,330
however the percentage of these jobs

185
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:17,349
held by women is on the decline and this

186
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:21,169
is what education looks like right this

187
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:23,419
terrifying ramp of up and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

188
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:25,279
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> economic barrier the actual</font>

189
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:28,308
economic barrier here is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety</font>

190
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:31,159
thousand dollar price tag<font color="#E5E5E5"> at schools</font>

191
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:33,349
like NYU a year to get an undergraduate

192
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:35,029
degree I don't know who can<font color="#E5E5E5"> graduate</font>

193
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:38,719
with that kind of debt and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

194
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:40,189
but be a slave so meanwhile we've seen

195
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,279
the rise of alternative STEM education

196
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,410
which is what can counter that right if

197
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,970
we have any hope at all it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

198
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,329
in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> teach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what they know for</font>

199
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:52,100
free everyone wants open structures we

200
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:55,160
all want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right it's something we're</font>

201
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,569
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> die early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for however at and</font>

202
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,550
you know we all want to include

203
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,319
diversity no one in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> room is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

204
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,089
want women on people of color in my

205
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:05,089
office in fact I think many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you want</font>

206
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:07,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly the opposite however we're</font>

207
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,529
tripping up and we're not changing our

208
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,079
surrounding culture and that's the

209
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:14,569
problem so no matter how much we want to

210
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:17,449
include diversity until we address the

211
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:21,500
cultural systemic problems here and do

212
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:23,389
things like really<font color="#CCCCCC"> question baidu does</font>

213
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,480
that need to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a PCB board do we</font>

214
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:28,009
really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this harder we're</font>

215
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,990
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in trouble so here's and</font>

216
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:32,720
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

217
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:35,569
you guys to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me change over the</font>

218
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,670
coming years so one we need to really

219
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:39,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with the participation of women and</font>

220
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">people of color in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

221
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,229
so if you run a<font color="#E5E5E5"> form or you moderate a</font>

222
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:47,880
forum be very aware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a</font>

223
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:51,360
possibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very hostile place for a</font>

224
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,610
woman to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a post we must position</font>

225
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,140
our image so be aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> also if you're</font>

226
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,510
making a flyer you're putting a header

227
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,760
on your website is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a woman</font>

228
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:03,120
or a person of color because that makes

229
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,670
a big difference harassment if you see

230
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,190
harassment happening in your forums or

231
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,689
on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> sites please do something about</font>

232
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,290
it if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see it happening in your</font>

hacker spaces immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> address it</font>

adopt a cop like a code of<font color="#CCCCCC"> conduct I</font>

235
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,560
can't encourage you enough there are

236
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,560
open-source ones that you can check<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

237
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,500
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet bullying is also really</font>

238
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,229
problematic we need to redesign work in

239
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,790
a way that can include women and people

240
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,019
of color often they come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

241
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">backgrounds that don't look like</font>

242
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:36,390
traditional engineering backgrounds and

243
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:38,670
you should go hey maybe I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create</font>

244
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,949
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity here and give someone a</font>

245
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,110
chance to learn on the job or share some

246
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,760
of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> skills because often that employee</font>

247
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,290
is probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be way better and</font>

248
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,880
way more loyal than if you had just

249
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">hired somebody who looked like they were</font>

250
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,120
qualified on paper who we hire right

251
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,130
that that goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that issue so we</font>

252
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,050
have a lack of investment in women<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

253
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,240
people of color for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of thing</font>

254
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,899
like HR companies they say we want this

255
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,820
giant list of crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then like a woman</font>

256
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,250
has you know two or three of those

257
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,020
qualifications and won't apply or worse

258
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,940
she'll actually have statistically

259
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,140
eighty percent and<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't apply but if a</font>

260
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,810
guy has like I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's something</font>

261
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:19,020
insane like five percent he'll apply so

262
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:21,270
we need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens we</font>

263
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,610
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to quit your bitching by</font>

264
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,100
honestly when someone clones your<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty</font>

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">dollar PCB board for five bucks chances</font>

266
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,399
are you deserved it go make something

267
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,290
else and share it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the community</font>

268
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,810
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the privilege to do it</font>

269
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,339
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I'm</font>

270
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,949
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage everyone in here to</font>

271
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:40,920
do is lick pass standard qualifications

272
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:44,699
when judging or assessing if someone is

273
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:48,149
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merit so I'm going to ask that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

274
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:50,040
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this deeply accessible is</font>

275
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:52,589
this new is putting the

276
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,680
piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> component on a PC board that i</font>

277
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:57,509
got from<font color="#E5E5E5"> china and selling it back</font>

278
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,859
making it more or less accessible for

279
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:02,279
people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use and understand this</font>

280
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,269
technology why are we so why should you

281
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:08,939
care why should anyone in this room

282
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:11,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">worry about this okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is kind of</font>

283
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">my big idea here think about technology</font>

284
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,019
