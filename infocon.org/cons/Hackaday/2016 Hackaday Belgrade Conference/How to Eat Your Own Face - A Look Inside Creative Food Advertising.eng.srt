52
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:46,409
they take the Dingle<font color="#CCCCCC"> bop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they push</font>

53
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:48,989

54
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,970
is rubbed against it it's important that

55
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,030
the flea vis rubbed because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fleadh</font>

56

has all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> philippe juice then ash</font>

his<font color="#CCCCCC"> erds in the way the blimps rub</font>

60
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,739
against the tumbles and the ploobis and

61
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:14,579
grumbo are shaved away that leaves you

62
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:18,419

one everybody has a plumber's so replace

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,280
you know sleep and fleam with solder as

66
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:31,829
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what what we do so</font>

67
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm gonna go into a level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of granularity</font>

68
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:36,019
that I don't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into very often</font>

69
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,209
so um I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna take you on a magical</font>

70
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,090
whirlwind tour of a few projects that

71
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:46,500
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked on over the last few years</font>

72
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:48,659
mostly involving white creamy pastes so

73
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,549
here's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> video of what I've been</font>

74
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,548
up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the last last 18 months</font>

75
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,780
it's an unfortunate reality when you

76
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,430
work in advertising that about ninety

77
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,219
percent of your ideas will never go

78
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,660
anywhere and about maybe only ten

79
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,890
percent of what you saw there actually

80
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:13,050
got built or finished so we're gonna

81
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,849
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a white creamy paste and you</font>

82
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hellmann's here you guys know</font>

83
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">hellmann's right hellmann's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got best</font>

84
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,580
foods in some countries it's a

85
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,510
mayonnaise<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of delicious and</font>

86
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,580
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> came to us with a really</font>

87
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:26,070
interesting brief and that was how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

88
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,260
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some are eating more exciting</font>

89
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,870
because actually the practicalities

90
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,690
summer eating<font color="#CCCCCC"> are that you get flies in</font>

91
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:36,360
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> food and you get you know people</font>

92
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,440
like overcooking your burger and burning

93
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,780
it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's all these little</font>

94
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually kind of make it a</font>

95
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,340
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> like crap so that we wanted to make</font>

96
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">it better it's it's pretty cool brief to</font>

97
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,710
work on so they they brought they

98
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,700
brought me in to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of inject more of</font>

99
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:58,919
a like a hacker attitude this brief and

100
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:01,170
so the purists of you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know mace kind</font>

101
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,390
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> atop this as like bastardizing the</font>

102
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:06,570
theme of hacking but really when it

103
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:10,229
boils down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the product</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is itself a</font>

104
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,520
way of hacking food so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

105
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,860
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know playing with that tracks</font>

106
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,870
here or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you let's not I guess</font>

107
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,420
it's so tightly hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so we're</font>

108
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,530
hiking hardware but it's edible so this

109
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,530
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a manifesto video that we made</font>

110
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,600
bye

111
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:18,509
and so what we created was for hero

112
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:22,979
hacks we had the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hellmann's solar</font>

113
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">lantern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jarrah we hand the Java cue the</font>

114
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:29,669
DJ powered BBQ<font color="#E5E5E5"> and burger selfies so I'm</font>

115
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,680
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk mostly about burger</font>

116
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:34,680
selfies and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna show a few clips</font>

117
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:41,909
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DJ powered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BBQ because because</font>

118
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:46,949
it's DJ powered<font color="#E5E5E5"> BBQ so burger selfies it</font>

119
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:49,919
was based on three trends food trucks 3d

120
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:52,529
printing and selfies and so we combined

121
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,469
them together<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up with this idea</font>

122
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:57,209
and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working out how we were</font>

123
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:58,979
going to build it we kind of looked at

124
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:00,599
what exists already what have been done

125
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar and some of you may have</font>

126
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:06,209
seen the google chrome labs experiment

127
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:10,080
where you could scan your face with

128
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:12,659
webcam and it would it would draw your

129
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,279
face in sand and a really lovely project

130
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,930
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually open sourced it as well so</font>

131
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know what at one point we started</font>

132
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,399
building something similar and I can see

133
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:23,939
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use sams now sounds a lovely</font>

134
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:28,289
medium it's clean it's not greasy it's a

135
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:30,419
consistent and so we thought okay yeah

136
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:34,588
you know mayonnaise it can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

137
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:36,448
harder than sand or can it so i have to

138
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:38,699
admit i try not to that physics getting

139
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:39,779
away of a good idea but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think I</font>

140
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:42,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">was fully prepared for some the</font>

141
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:48,120
technical challenges that printing male

142
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:50,339
faces on brokers will create when we

143
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,290
first discussed the idea it was actually

144
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,620
going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fully automated system</font>

145
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,849
that was all app driven where the

146
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,970
machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> would just just hit a button</font>

147
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:02,490
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just go but the realities are</font>

148
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,450
quite quite different so with the help

149
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,150
of another

150
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:10,320
ologist we wrote a software program that

151
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:14,300
would take your face create some

152
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,370
outlines and spit out<font color="#E5E5E5"> G code and that</font>

153
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:21,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">did not produce good results and it's</font>

154
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting because we didn't you when</font>

155
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,280
you start working<font color="#CCCCCC"> out put on a project</font>

156
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:28,020
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yeah it kind of it kind of</font>

157
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,819
brought up some quite profound questions

158
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:33,540
like what are the things that make<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

159
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,910
you like what are the features of this

160
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:40,020
guy's face that make him look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

161
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:42,959
so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you have to create a</font>

162
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:45,390
caricature of other face when you're

163
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,540
dealing with a medium that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not most</font>

164
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:50,580
expressive and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> canvas itself is it's</font>

165
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,219
a burger<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an undulating meat</font>

166
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,950
Mountain it's it's anyone it's the 3d

167
00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:00,060
printing will know that you need a level

168
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:02,790
bed and the burger is not level it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

169
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,760
flat it's greasy and every burger has a

170
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:09,959
different set height so that presented a

171
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,730
whole new range of issues as well so we

172
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,350
end up creating semi automatic system

173
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:18,900
where it would the edge detection but

174
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,970
then we kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drawn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the lines manually</font>

175
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:24,900
just to make sure that the faces that's

176
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:29,520
true to the original face as possible so

177
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:33,920
the first results the first print was

178
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:37,230
not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> great no yeah but I have to say</font>

179
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm gonna talk about how we create this</font>

180
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:43,530
in a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this was really</font>

181
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,330
emotional for me because so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours</font>

182
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,520
have gone into doing that and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

183
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">very first print and I was actually</font>

184
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">really happy with and I think it looks</font>

185
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">great now at the time there was no</font>

186
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,710
commercial paste extruder it wasn't on I

187
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't on the market sure there's a few</font>

188
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,950
ones you that you could you print on

189
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thingiverse but this did they what they</font>

190
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:09,270
weren't kind of what we needed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

191
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:12,030
to build my own I had had just over a

192
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,620
week to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it has a really really fast</font>

193
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,290
turnaround project

194
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,830
and it we also had very little budget

195
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually we had about we had about 3,000</font>

196
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:25,380
pounds for the for the whole builds is

197
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:28,650
really really really nothing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

198
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:31,140
I fired<font color="#E5E5E5"> up sketchup and create this is</font>

199
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,750
an engineer so I like don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate don't</font>

200
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:39,810
judge like I had no time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what I</font>

201
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:42,060
created it works sort of but so it what

202
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,040
we needed was a huge amount of torque to

203
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,339
push mayonnaise through a tube now I

204
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,130
haven't had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to refer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my fluid</font>

205
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,750
dynamics textbook<font color="#E5E5E5"> since University and I</font>

206
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,320
I've I didn't really fair to Dan either

207
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:57,029
i actually failed the exam but I when I

208
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,320
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> working when I was trying to push</font>

209
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:03,839
mayonnaise through this PTFE tube the

210
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,380
inner diameter of like four mil I

211
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,150
suddenly realized and I don't know why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

212
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,830
took me so long to realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but</font>

213
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,439
mayonnaise is actually a non-newtonian

214
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,660
fluid it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solid it's not liquid</font>

215
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,640
so when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to pushing it through a</font>

216
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,620
tube it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to predict how</font>

217
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,880
it's going to move and it takes a huge

218
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,860
amount of force and this thing was was

219
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,630
bending and warping and creaking and

220
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,690
actually it had enough torque to crush

221
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,730
an apple or your hands but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was still</font>

222
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:34,800
struggling with with the mayonnaise so

223
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,990
if this is what I bust out the

224
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">thermodynamics textbook realized I had</font>

225
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,020
no idea what I was doing and I just

226
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:45,180
ended up<font color="#E5E5E5"> ordering a bigger tube so that</font>

227
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:48,839
worked fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta bots we went for a</font>

228
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:51,810
delta bot design because of aesthetics

229
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,190
yeah pure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and simple the reason we went</font>

230
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:56,069
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this design is because we wanted to</font>

231
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">mount little mayonnaise bottle in the</font>

232
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:02,490
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it would be much easier to go</font>

233
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,310
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cartesian style printer much much</font>

234
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,480
easier but this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of style</font>

235
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,790
we're going for and we want to be able

236
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,459
to brand it up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an advert</font>

237
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,079
after all so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the the branded</font>

238
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:14,790
machine that you can see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our art</font>

239
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:20,310
director looking at it quick confused

240
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:22,589
and by this point we had kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of made</font>

241
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:25,050
some progress on on the quality of the

242
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:27,359
prince and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

243
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:33,699
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

244
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:37,119
that's me yeah yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> also me</font>

245
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:40,329
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> aha you try some geometric</font>

246
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:42,579
shapes actually we weren't totally sure

247
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:45,488
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we could print any working face and</font>

248
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:47,108
so what we decided was well it's just

249
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:49,059
changed the idea so we're not printing

250
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:52,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">sell for printing shapes so like</font>

251
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:56,108
emoticons or the weather so this was us

252
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:59,799
trying that as a as a as a last attempt

253
00:13:56,109 --> 00:14:01,329
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> can save the project but we developed</font>

254
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:05,589
more Maori team played with different

255
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:08,409
nozzle sizes we hacked the the firmware

256
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:10,749
we're running off<font color="#CCCCCC"> mega</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mega</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tronix board</font>

257
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:14,769
which is basically start be no mega so

258
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:16,419
made some changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the software and we</font>

259
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:19,359
started to get stuff that was that was

260
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:23,739
looking pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good this is our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

261
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:26,799
a copywriter so we I mean we<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized</font>

262
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:28,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">that once we were testing on real</font>

263
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,819
burgers and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't the burgers</font>

264
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you get in Tesco or another super</font>

265
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:35,439
markets that are you know produced by

266
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:37,659
the million<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you know the h1</font>

267
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:39,879
is exactly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same these are actually</font>

268
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:42,939
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> called juicy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lucy's they were</font>

269
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:46,089
a delicious gourmet burger that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

270
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:49,719
filled with cheese really tasty but like

271
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:54,099
really awful to print on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also they</font>

272
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,470
used quite a luxurious beef so whenever

273
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:58,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">you grilled it never you cooked it the</font>

274
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,269
the fact would melt away leaving these

275
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:04,209
deep kind of troughs in the burger so

276
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:05,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">while delicious it was a you know</font>

277
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:09,399
another problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to try and kind</font>

278
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:12,549
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a testing on</font>

279
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:15,129
actual burgers so every every every

280
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:17,589
morning I would we<font color="#E5E5E5"> our office was in</font>

281
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:21,369
Canary Wharf until until recently so I

282
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:24,579
would soon as gbk gourmet burger kitchen

283
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:27,129
to burger chain in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK and Byron</font>

284
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:28,959
opened<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lab my clock I'd pop over</font>

285
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:32,829
and by about ten burgers from each one

286
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">and i would use those for testing my</font>

287
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:37,300
prince each day and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll do is how</font>

288
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">to eat probably five of the burgers</font>

289
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,979
and then choose the burger that that was

290
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,450
the flattest and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

291
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,970
using that burger for the rest of the

292
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">day and so like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> burger has</font>

293
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,550
literally been used about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 maybe 20</font>

294
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">times and each time we'd print on it</font>

295
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:56,229
I'll just take it over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bathrooms</font>

296
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,510
rinse it under the tap<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

297
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:02,230
very liquid and some hands at Dove soap

298
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:05,500
and and then I would glaze that glaze it

299
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,180
loving me with some some oil and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

300
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,630
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a real burger and then I'd</font>

301
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:12,010
slap it back on the on the hot plate I

302
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,470
actually didn't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> until about</font>

303
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,720
maybe maybe a week into this project

304
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:21,130
that two of the people around<font color="#E5E5E5"> me were</font>

305
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,720
vegan and it was when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said oh i can</font>

306
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,579
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> cook burgers using the hot</font>

307
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,950
plate it goes 100 degrees<font color="#E5E5E5"> c that was</font>

308
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:31,359
when they were like right now how<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

309
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:35,529
enough no no hot plate yeah I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

310
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,209
so now we were signed to get loud stop

311
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,890
that sort of it it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a person</font>

312
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:43,000
now which i think is is it's a good

313
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:48,699
start and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the printer</font>

314
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:53,020
in action in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna helping</font>

315
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:55,390
the extra along<font color="#CCCCCC"> bye-bye I'm doing the</font>

316
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,790
retraction on it because the cause of

317
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:01,449
the play in the mechanism it wasn't very

318
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,680
it wasn't attracting<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I any money</font>

319
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,839
3d prints all know that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

320
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">avoid stringing you wanna maybe if</font>

321
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:10,329
you're using a baton to maybe a three to

322
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,000
five mil retraction after each like

323
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:15,579
deadlift so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of doing that</font>

324
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,109
myself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the final film and</font>

325
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:21,849
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> closely you will see me</font>

326
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:24,479
standing in the burger truck skin

327
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,480
sweating away

328
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:21,020
and that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you eat your own face</font>

329
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:31,129
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should also add that most of the</font>

330
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,190
people that film we're actually members

331
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:36,918
of the public there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a handful of</font>

332
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:38,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">ogilvie employees so but most</font>

333
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:41,419
attractions were real it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

334
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:44,809
something people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> laid loves so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

335
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:46,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> java q so the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here was to</font>

336
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:49,009
create a miniature<font color="#E5E5E5"> barbecue one person</font>

337
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:52,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">barbecue and that would fit into it into</font>

338
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:54,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hellmann's jar and so it started off</font>

339
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:59,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little sketch on bit of paper and</font>

340
00:18:54,159 --> 00:19:01,820
then we had but two days to build a

341
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:06,590
prototype<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is then</font>

342
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we did so fired up Sketchup mark</font>

343
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,629
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this this bad boy what you'll</font>

344
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,320
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's got a grill on the top</font>

345
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:18,199
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hellmann's logo so it burns</font>

346
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:23,059
hellmann's into the burger and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully</font>

347
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,369
into your hearts and this was we because

348
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:30,168
times are so short I just fired this

349
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:33,289
onto<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ultimaker mark one at this fastest</font>

350
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:36,139
setting horrible quality and this was

351
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:39,320
the end result and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we then did was</font>

352
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:42,678
we use the oldest manufacturing

353
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,439
technique to build a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> jarba q</font>

354
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,700
because we wanted to show it one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

355
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,489
should cook a burger with it before we

356
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,609
showed us the client so here's what we

357
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,609
did

358
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,289
we

359
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,700
the keen-eyed among you may notice that

360
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:35,730
the burger was from mcdonalds don't tell

361
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,799
anyone don't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> a client</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I forgot</font>

362
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">to remove the cheese which is why those</font>

363
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:44,869
cheese all over but they bought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

364
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:44,869
and this is the final film

365
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,299
it's when you see this things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

366
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:27,490
getting shot that you just discover all

367
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:32,250
these little<font color="#E5E5E5"> tricks like the smoke is</font>

368
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:34,600
actually incense stick and the charred

369
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:37,059
that the charred burger was actually

370
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,439
spray painted on it's quite this little

371
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:42,418
tricks that I learned from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a production</font>

372
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:46,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">company so that was the job with you</font>

373
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,890
this is the case that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we filmed for the</font>

374
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:49,960
so my favorite hack was actually the DJ

375
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:53,500
powered<font color="#CCCCCC"> barbecue and the original idea</font>

376
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,750
was inspired by a YouTube video of an

377
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,490
object<font color="#CCCCCC"> called the pyro board I think</font>

378
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,980
some people will will will know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

379
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:04,390
and the pirate board is essentially a

380
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:07,510
steel box sealed with two speakers on

381
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,880
either end maybe are several hundred

382
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:12,930
holes on the top and you feel full of

383
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:16,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">gas you play music</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through speakers</font>

384
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:20,040
understanding waves in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> box cause</font>

385
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:23,140
areas of higher low pressure creating

386
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,300
various flame sizes depending on the

387
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,660
frequency of the music so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

388
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:30,310
means in practice is you get a really

389
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,140
interesting effect where whenever

390
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:35,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a bass note you'll see no big</font>

391
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,690
yellow flames and maybe smaller flames

392
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,570
in a different part of the board for

393
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:43,180
like a snare so we took this to our

394
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,620
production partner this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

395
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:48,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that I could have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made in an</font>

396
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:50,139
office<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so they said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so you</font>

397
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:54,310
you want us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you wants to build a</font>

398
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:56,950
steel box<font color="#CCCCCC"> and fill it full of gas put</font>

399
00:24:54,310 --> 00:25:00,850
some holes in it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then light it so</font>

400
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:03,550
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a bomb and actually to</font>

401
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,830
be fair that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of was what we</font>

402
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,960
were asking him<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and so they were</font>

403
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:10,480
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't yeah we're not building a</font>

404
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,150
bomb for you guys we know we do a lot of

405
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,830
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you but we're not doing that so</font>

406
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,990
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> then had to do is work at how</font>

407
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:19,600
else we could do it and so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

408
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could kind of fake it it</font>

409
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:27,730
is advertising after all<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are kind of</font>

410
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">fake it using a gas powered psalms</font>

411
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:33,280
solenoid valves solenoid casts files and

412
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,530
that's what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did so we got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arduino</font>

413
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,020
hook mop the solenoids we created three

414
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:40,570
channels<font color="#CCCCCC"> bass middle treble</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

415
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:44,070
meant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could essentially recreate</font>

416
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:47,689
the effect and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

417
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">mr. filner we created</font>

418
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,149
Oh

419
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:49,440
this is actually a really funny shoot

420
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:51,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the while it's got a cool</font>

421
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,580
machine it was the worst barbecue you

422
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:57,180
could possibly imagine it burnt the

423
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:59,520
out of everything you put on it and so

424
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,730
we had a food stylist there he was

425
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,010
preparing our hero corner and so we

426
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,840
would put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hero corn on the grill and</font>

427
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:10,020
it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be annihilated in about</font>

428
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,270
two minutes and so the producer would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

429
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:16,170
shouting across the garden we need more

430
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:18,480
hero corn one more hero corn and we just

431
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:23,130
went through like like I know 30 of

432
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:26,670
these hero corns and another fun fact

433
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:28,500
was again most people that video we're

434
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:30,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">just kind of our friends and I actually</font>

435
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,770
didn't tell them that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be</font>

436
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,550
for a shoot I just asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they'd come</font>

437
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:37,260
around for<font color="#E5E5E5"> barbecue and so they were I</font>

438
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:39,000
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually realize this at the time</font>

439
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,250
but they were presented with these

440
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,200
delicious beautifully styled plates of

441
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,960
food and but they weren't allowed to eat

442
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,520
them and they're all starving so I felt

443
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">really bad it'll actually quite cold as</font>

444
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,990
well so they stood in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my garden for</font>

445
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:55,650
three hours pretending to dance with no

446
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:59,250
music either with this delicious plates

447
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:03,090

448
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:05,430
down they were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so sad and I felt</font>

449
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:07,139
even worse because one of my friends

450
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:10,410
even came round with some dessert as

451
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:15,720
well but<font color="#CCCCCC"> she didn't get to eat it so</font>
