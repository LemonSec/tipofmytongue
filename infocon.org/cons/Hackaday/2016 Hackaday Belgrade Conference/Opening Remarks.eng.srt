39
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,990
hackaday but uh so<font color="#E5E5E5"> my primary day-to-day</font>

40
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,960
role is<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh is a CTO at a company called</font>

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,449
supplier frame and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the easiest</font>

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">way to explain about supplier from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

43
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,250
is is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a whole bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of super</font>

44
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,810
nerdy computer science people really

45
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,160
passionate about electronics a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

46
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,400
have you know academic or professional

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,230
backgrounds in with Johnny

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,879
but our kind of core expertise is softer

49
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,569
and you know what we try to do every day

50
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,200
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> right software build tools that that</font>

51
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:25,909
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know really help you know the how</font>

52
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,499
people building harder you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

53
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:29,388
extent that we can and you know we kind

54
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:31,159
of hope we can hope we can do a lots are

55
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,450
you know big mission is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

56
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,858
organizing the world of engineering

57
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,988
knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know being like a</font>

58
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:38,090
Google of electronics and all that other

59
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,099
awesome stuff we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been around for you</font>

60
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,919
know quite sometimes almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font>

61
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:44,719
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years now and you know we did</font>

62
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:47,239
some fairly interesting things I'm not

63
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get into but why are we</font>

64
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,530
relevant because in the context of this

65
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,739
presentation is that you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font>

66
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,569
around three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago our favorite</font>

67
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:59,480
website hackaday came up with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> article</font>

68
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,500
that says hack days up for sale and you

69
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,469
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hackett has been around for a while</font>

70
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,750
also by 12 years started out as a blog

71
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:07,730
on engadget and since then had like a

72
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,150
really interesting interesting history

73
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:13,488
but you know it's a the previous owner

74
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,280
came to the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you know he was</font>

75
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:18,349
kind of stuck and I think that the way

76
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,549
the way he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was thinking about hacked it</font>

77
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:21,590
was more like a media company or

78
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:23,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that and he decided to</font>

79
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">sell it and you know we just woke up one</font>

80
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,959
morning and we were like oh my god like

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,639
heck it is up for sale you know whoever

82
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,340
buys it is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ruin it and</font>

83
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,900
what do we buy and it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

84
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">weird like why would software company by</font>

85
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:40,040
a you know a blog a website but we you

86
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:42,530
know we one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our engineers rent or CEO</font>

87
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,900
who is an amazing guy is somewhere in

88
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">this audience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see from all the</font>

89
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,650
lights bahaha and and he convinced him

90
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:51,918
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should really do this</font>

91
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:54,620
and get with it and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

92
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope so our core idea was you know the</font>

93
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,299
at the time hackaday put up a

94
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,609
Kickstarter campaign<font color="#CCCCCC"> an IndieGoGo</font>

95
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,769
campaign for a community to buy for a

96
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:05,090
community to buy hackaday and you know

97
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brian bench up for this elaborate</font>

98
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,879
presentation about all the awesome

99
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:09,168
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would do with it and we</font>

100
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,310
saw the presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font>

101
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:12,199
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is really cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know maybe</font>

102
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,449
maybe we can help maybe we can do

103
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,849
something about it and then I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

104
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:20,030
you know first year was really first

105
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:21,289
year of us acquiring hackaday people who

106
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,940
are equally suspicious you know where

107
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:25,729
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do you know</font>

108
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,550
ruin<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so back from the day one we set</font>

109
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,490
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole bunch of ethical</font>

110
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,140
limitations around you know editorial

111
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,210
independence and really trying to do the

112
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,039
right thing and most importantly you

113
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,530
know because we are all software nerds

114
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,780
electronics nerds we really understand

115
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,700
this space we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really kind of felt that</font>

116
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,780
we can introduce something unique the

117
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,490
kind of things that other people

118
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,650
wouldn't do and you know truly<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

119
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">triggers later I think we you know we</font>

120
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,169
did a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different stuff but</font>

121
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,030
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know some of the things some of the</font>

122
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,030
interesting things that we did on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

123
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,890
day one obviously being softer people we

124
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,599
said well what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we build with softer</font>

125
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,940
and then we went out<font color="#CCCCCC"> in we build</font>

126
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">hackaday ayah which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know two years</font>

127
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">in is really became you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know become for</font>

128
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,010
a lot about just a place where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hang</font>

129
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,960
out and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always wanted to have</font>

130
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:12,469
something that reminds us of a like a

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,150
BBS or something like that that in a

132
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,650
very special in its creation<font color="#E5E5E5"> oriented</font>

133
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not like Facebook for hackers it's</font>

134
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,169
more you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how do we create more like</font>

135
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,030
a collaborative online environment for

136
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,890
for people to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with other</font>

137
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,000
people and meet other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from around</font>

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,780
extremely successful and you know we

140
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,039
were kind of continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to push it you</font>

dead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the print is that no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cares</font>

150
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:56,210
about any of this stuff but uh but we

151
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:58,880

152
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,489
build a in a professional journalist

153
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,620
like organization that's that's you know

154
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,870
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do journalism the way it was</font>

155
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,520
done in computing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the eighties</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in you</font>

00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,160
ridiculous in the for our community

161

because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Oliver I just we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're really committed to this and I</font>

166
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,250
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've kind of come a long way and</font>

167
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,020
you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to continue pushing</font>

168
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,270
pushing that because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of believe</font>

169
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is the right thing to do you know</font>

170
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,250
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font>

171
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,080
and you know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that you may</font>

172
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,280
learn we knew if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with us over</font>

173
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do a lot of planning</font>

174
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,080
a lot of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have done we're</font>

175
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,660
really spontaneous were just like spur

176
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,919
of the moment why not we can do this and

177
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,170
all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and one of the things</font>

178
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,780
that came out of like late-night

179
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,490
drinking in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pasadena you know we had</font>

180
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,010
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about well you know what is</font>

181
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,750
you know the open hardware and you know

182
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,070
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and everyone builds their little</font>

183
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,660
project and put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shelf but how</font>

184
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,490
do we motivate people to really build

185
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,710
something more serious you know because

186
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,620
for the open hearted to really matter we

187
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,060
need production product<font color="#E5E5E5"> great open</font>

188
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,310
hardware products are the people can

189
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,540
build and you know so we were and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

190
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,520
the time bench of came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with this</font>

191
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,650
ridiculous idea of like a heck of a

192
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,909
space<font color="#E5E5E5"> program and then we're drinking</font>

193
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> drinking and then flag was like well</font>

194
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,720
what are we you know send some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

195
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,100
space would that<font color="#E5E5E5"> be would that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font>

196
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,210
interesting incentive for people and

197
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,860
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the heck of the price</font>

198
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,060
was and then we were all just like

199
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,710
laughing then tomorrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning for I</font>

200
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,880
calls me up and he's like oh we should

201
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,710
really do this you know we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

202
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,890
figure out the money and so we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

203
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,479
heck of a prize really just as a one of

204
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,330
the ways to give back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community</font>

205
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,830
and really to create a way to to

206
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,030
motivate people because we all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

207
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,650
you know we all like to procrastinate

208
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,840
and it's and it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

209
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,099
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual motivation so you know we're</font>

210
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,929
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a heck of a price for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a third year</font>

211
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,090
now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's been growing and growing</font>

212
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,070
and a lot of a lot of amazing project

213
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,119
came out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so you know we're</font>

214
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">really happy about it and we're gonna</font>

215
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue pushing it especially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the</font>

216
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,760
last two years Sophie Kravitz who is

217
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,270
also here you know it's done an amazing

218
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,620
job and really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of growing it so</font>

219
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,849
yeah you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to continue</font>

220
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,320
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as well and then another</font>

221
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that we did also very</font>

222
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,380
spontaneously like last year Sophie and

223
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,599
I were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sitting at being grumpy</font>

224
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,370
about how in the u.s. there are no good

225
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
harder conference is because in

226
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,100
especially in electronics everyone is

227
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,780
trying to sell you something so a lot of

228
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,340
these are just like very you know sales

229
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,900
driven which is fine the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

230
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,729
there are just no more conferences with

231
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,469
you know deep technical content and so

232
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:29,830
we were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know being grumpy and</font>

233
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:31,330
yeah and talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> or what did we do why</font>

234
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't we do a conference and something</font>

235
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,110
was like yeah it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a super</font>

236
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,539
conference and so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

237
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,180
like end of sep tember and then and then

238
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">we were like a woman should we do it and</font>

239
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,390
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why don't we do it at the end</font>

296
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,310
who was here in Belgrade like oh can you

297
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:34,480
go find the venue and then somehow he we

298
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">were joking about like this space</font>

299
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,620
because this is a this is a legendary

300
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,449
space for us it's a like a Belgrade

301
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,920
youth center a lot of events<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

303
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,449
pace the first linux conferences were

304
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,099
happening here a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene demoscene</font>

305
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,810
events were happening here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

306
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,880
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> jokingly my guys been like all can</font>

307
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go and ask how much would it cost to</font>

308
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,680
rent in this venue and then he went here

309
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,840
in the and the the price was like like

310
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,640
really only that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> san francisco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vents</font>

311
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,230
are like super expensive so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

312
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it there</font>

313
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,500
and then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like well who's going to</font>

314
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,630
talk and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> because like Serbia is</font>

315
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,460
not a huge country there's not a massive

316
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,230
scene and then we said well why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

317
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,030
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a call out on half a day and then</font>

318
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe see someone maybe someone would</font>

319
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,930
apply maybe from like you know Bulgaria

320
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,370
or Croatia or something like that and

321
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,339
then so we get some speakers and then

322
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,350
two days later we have much 50 talk

323
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,720
proposals and oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> my god like this is not</font>

324
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">via I think so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know kind of</font>

325
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,280
decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really try an event and you</font>

326
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:31,079
know you may it may be funny but it's

327
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,060
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> three months this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our you know</font>

328
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">best planned event yet like three months</font>

329
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:39,599
for us is too long we plan like in weeks

330
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,790
so we're all here and you're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

331
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,770
of this so that's how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened but</font>

332
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:46,170
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> Belgrade</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so great you know you</font>

333
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,730
guys love hackaday and Irene and I think

334
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,219
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the weirdest part is that</font>

335
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,530
we we started to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like let's put our</font>

336
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,580
tickets on eventbrite and let's put the

337
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,449
tickets on eventbrite then maybe some

338
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are going to buy it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but then</font>

339
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,900
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put local tickets for</font>

340
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,130
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> serbian audience it turns out that</font>

341
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,819
like serbian audience doesn't really

342
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,080
have western credit cards and eventbrite

343
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,210
apparently doesn't even take visa

344
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,640
electron which would<font color="#CCCCCC"> we learned later so</font>

345
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,780
but we sold out more than half of a

346
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,199
tickets within the first couple of days

347
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,880
and pretty much at the end over half of

348
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,740
people here you know came from from

349
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,110
outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Serbia it just towards the</font>

350
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,060
end there were no enough tickets left to

351
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,740
sell to the local audience but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

352
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,930
some people you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know figure the way out</font>

353
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so I really applaud everyone they</font>

354
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">really made an effort here but the</font>

355
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is you know why Belgrade do you</font>

356
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,470
guys love happy that you came here to

357
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,240
hang<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with Sophie station but other</font>

358
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,280
people and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know socialize with your</font>

359
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">community and you know you a lot you</font>

360
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,910
know number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people will go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anywhere</font>

361
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,980
for hackaday but why did<font color="#CCCCCC"> we drag you to</font>

362
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:45,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">Belgrade you know what what's so special</font>

363
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:48,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this area and I think the team</font>

364
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:50,910
here is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> Belgrade itself is is that</font>

365
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,560
they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a point that</font>

366
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,219
the local cultures matter obviously

367
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">Belgrade is the closest to us and it's</font>

368
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,140
given you know hackaday has a number

369
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,540
several people working on hackaday live

370
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:06,540
or have lived in Belgrade and a lot of

371
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,280
our local culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really is really</font>

372
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,230
is influencing some of the editorial

373
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,329
direction but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

374
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,590
local cultures matters and the the

375
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,420
computing culture that was

376
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,240
has evolved here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Serbia is really</font>

377
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,620
weird and<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique and like in a lot of</font>

378
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,450
countries in Europe as opposed to maybe

379
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,100
us where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more you know of one</font>

380
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,840
uniform culture so if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

381
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,350
computing in Serbia and the weight

382
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,660
started in the in the eighties<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

383
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,190
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> started out as the mix of this</font>

384
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">magazine called the world of computers</font>

385
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:38,770
that was trying to be like a survey he

386
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,750
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> Latvian byte magazine that was the</font>

387
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,640
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is somewhere along</font>

388
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,620
the way it crossbred with this like

389
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:49,540
bizarre<font color="#CCCCCC"> Italian comic called Allan fort</font>

390
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,400
which is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this wacky right</font>

391
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,990
there it's really weird it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

392
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain it and not many people get it</font>

393
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,250
but like that that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a bizarre</font>

394
00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:00,010
graphic novel culture Hitchhiker's Guide

395
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,120
to the galaxy and like a lot of other

396
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,500
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were happening here like</font>

397
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,780
demoscene and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as a</font>

398
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,470
result of this there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like a</font>

399
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:11,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">really weird in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and unique culture and</font>

400
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,030
you know some of that some of that we

401
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,440
are also trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know some of that</font>

402
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,420
weirdness we're trying to bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

403
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,910
hackaday as well along with other types

404
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">of weirdness like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brian bench of Hunter</font>

405
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:25,510
Thompson has style that and other people

406
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,450
things as well but<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh the you know other</font>

407
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:30,310
other cultures in Europe other<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries</font>

408
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">have their own flavors of computing and</font>

409
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,890
it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are very</font>

410
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,599
important to cultivate and build<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

411
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,790
because we don't all just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on</font>

412
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,050
facebook and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the one the</font>

413
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,540
same thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font>

414
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:43,449
important but another thing that really

415
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:46,480
that really makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> Belgrade very relevant</font>

416
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:49,000
for hackaday is that a a year ago this

417
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,070
guy over here Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> gamo who runs you</font>

419
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,190

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,570
like oh well you know who's famous

421
