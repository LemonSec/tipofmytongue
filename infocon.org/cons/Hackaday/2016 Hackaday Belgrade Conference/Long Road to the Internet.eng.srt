the internet here in Serbia it is I hope

15
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,789
an interesting thing because people take

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:25,020
internet now for granted but it wasn't

17
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that way it all started in 1986 quite a</font>

but it was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very powerful email</font>

22
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,960
address because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could only communicate</font>

23
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:48,240
with other people at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> university</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:52,589
later at other parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yugoslavia but</font>

27
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,970
well known is because it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:55,440
encoded files from Treecko servers and

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,709
it all was going well until nineteen

48

politics here in nineteen eighty to

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,599
ninety two we had a war here the country

51
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:16,480
dissolved and the whole world decided

52
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,488
that we Serbs are the bad guys and as

53
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,970
you know the bad guys shouldn't have the

54
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:24,580
internet access so they cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> us so we had</font>

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:30,130
got nothing no internet access no email

56
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:33,280
nothing well so we lived in a country

57
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:38,140
handle under blockade and we had to do

58
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:44,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the work ourselves the key to do</font>

59

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:10,750
became the<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest baby st in Yugoslavia</font>

67
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,920
which was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult but also in</font>

all this part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Balkan it was a</font>

75
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:39,430
people came there to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all that</font>

76
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,340
mostly also to download some files

77
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:46,530
because it was the only way to download

78
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:49,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">new software public domain and other and</font>

79
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:52,090
they had to pay some subscription about

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,840
eighty dollars per<font color="#CCCCCC"> year which was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

81
00:04:52,090 --> 00:05:00,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that time so there was no</font>

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,859
not much digital<font color="#E5E5E5"> photo cameras and</font>

83
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,650
mobile phones at that time so I don't

84
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,229
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> many photographs of thousand BBS</font>

85
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:12,880
this one was taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> from some TV show</font>

where it was featured at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> goriest</font>

87
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:21,639
moments in 1994<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it used</font>

88
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:23,649
compaq deskpro server and it was my

89
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:28,239
lectures it was a workstation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

90
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:31,509
call this server it hits 330 megabytes

91
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:35,789
disk and we when people talked a lot

92
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:39,069
that this became full but we could not

93
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:42,339
acquire another disk that would fit

94
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:45,189
compaq they needed some special disks<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

95
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:47,679
we have to put another no-name pc with

00:05:54,009 --> 00:06:01,089
computer that are mostly outdated

100
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:03,369
computers even by<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time but they</font>

101
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:08,169
were cheap and that was all we could get

102
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:11,499
so every line was supported by one

103
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:14,318
computer they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to a</font>

network and they communicated with the

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:23,019
users using by today's standards very

106

slow modems<font color="#E5E5E5"> custom software was written</font>

120
00:07:06,549 --> 00:07:16,498
each of the commands and so pay eighty

121
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:20,619
dollars a year which was odd sometimes

122
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:23,769
standard salaries were maybe ten dollars

123
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:30,110
a month so it was a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money so we</font>

124
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:33,370
have successful technically able<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

125
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:37,730
and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the secret of the success</font>

126
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:40,850
people mostly talked on our BBS and here

127
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:43,880
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the first five were for 45</font>

128
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:46,730
years people<font color="#CCCCCC"> talks about computers and</font>

129
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">other subjects and you can see there was</font>

130
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:52,940
one hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forty thousand messages</font>

131
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:56,660
in the best year that's a lot if you

132
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:59,030
take total<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of characters if you</font>

see how how many characters<font color="#E5E5E5"> people wrote</font>

134
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,830
that was text only we didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

154
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:14,420
the connections were lousy so we found

that they didn't cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> x.25 network postal</font>

send short messages it was expensive but

169
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:03,709
it really worked or some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people found</font>

another heck they could connect to

177
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:29,209
then you can get some free access and

maybe send<font color="#E5E5E5"> email or something but of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people thought well let's use some</font>

tricks let's make it even easier so they

183
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:53,060
did things like this you sent on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> vax</font>

00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:57,230
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> email to this strange address</font>

185
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,920
it says well go to using packet network

186
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:03,260
to some system in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Swiss and then send</font>

mail from there if somebody wants to

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:11,319
reply to you he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use other address</font>

189
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:17,810
to say go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that system and have it</font>

190
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:20,029
mailed<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet the message to a recipient it</font>

191
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:22,899
was expensive not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for us but also</font>

192
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:25,540
for that systems and they didn't like it

<font color="#E5E5E5">this particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system had an</font>

was named smart in winter sunshine on

00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:38,089
Pegasus bebes and he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well what are</font>

197
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,120
you doing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using our resources</font>

198
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:43,670
why are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that we said well you</font>

199
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are cut from the internet we</font>

200
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,399
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way to communicate with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

202
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,490
cannot allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will stop</font>

203
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,490
looking so

204
00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:02,120
so we use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot at least he was a</font>

205
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:06,979
good man so greetings talking wherever

206
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:10,340
he is now and now finally we found a

207
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:13,700
real solution one of our guys in

208
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:16,460
California State University decided to

209
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:21,470
route all the email to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Serbia from his</font>

210
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:25,520
office computer he had a computer in his

211
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:29,780
office and he puts a male around it and

212
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,540
we had strange email addresses like this

213
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:35,329
but it really worked and our friends of

214
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> university made it work by on the</font>

215
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:40,010
school<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Electrical Engineering a</font>

216
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:47,360
faculty or organizational scientists

217
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:50,480
they wrote some custom software that use

218
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:55,700
all the tricks to using our dials using

219
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:59,000
other means to deliver the mail receive

220
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:04,150
the email distribute that email using

221
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:09,440
UCP protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> to other computers in</font>

222
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:12,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">Serbia and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system was slow but it</font>

223
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,930
really worked it was also expensive but

224
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,290
we had money at the time you see one of

225
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font>

226
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:29,160
one of the notes we had many of these so

227
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually if you wait a bit to pay your</font>

228
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,879
phone bill however big your phone bill

229
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:38,490
is it will meet will not be much money

230
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,529
because when this bank note was

231
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,899
published it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked like two dollars</font>

232
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:46,160
a week later it was worked like ten

233
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:51,360
cents so if you wait a week then the

234
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:54,300
bill goes down and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we</font>

235
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,939
lost all the wars so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were still the</font>

236
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:00,508
bad guys but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we were defeated</font>

237
00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:02,939
bad guys and defeated bad guys could

238
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:10,430
have internet access but it has to be

239
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:13,709
slow so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got one satellite link it was</font>

64 kilobits<font color="#E5E5E5"> per second for complete</font>

offered full internet access more diving

251
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:54,470
fault lines reported our software to

00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:58,079
32-bit platform using the NT servers and

253
00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:01,829
we became one of the important internet

254
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:04,620
providers but even most importantly a

called<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet revolution in</font>

260
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:23,899
belgrade it was about how the users of

<font color="#CCCCCC">says and B&BS use the internet to</font>

00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:30,720
oppress the repressive government

263
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:34,830
and fight for their freedom and as you

264
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,350
can see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> David call was one of the</font>

culture without whose cooperation and

269
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,720
support the internet would not exist as

270
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,630
a political weapon so we came to the

271
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,180
politics again but it were important

272
00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:00,810
times and eventually the repressive

repressive regime well what happened

277
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:18,810
next everything was much easier but
