00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,030
this happen and supply frame<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacka days</font>

parent company has made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a priority to</font>

48
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:37,360
make events<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this happen in as many</font>

49
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,500
places as possible and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,860
they do that is they know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> special what we have here and along</font>

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,280
bridges and vast share those same values

55
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,200

56
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,540
doing events like this are important and

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,060

60
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,750
so now we get to the part where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font>

61
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to state the obvious and really the</font>

62
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,400
obvious thing here that many people miss

63
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,019
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what hackaday is all</font>

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,660
about and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what hackaday has</font>

65
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:23,150
always been<font color="#E5E5E5"> about so you could have sat</font>

66
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,680
at home and watch TV all day but you

67
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,110
didn't you decided to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and here</font>

68
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,430
these amazing amazing talks and work on

69
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,490
badge hacking and participate in

70
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,530
workshops and have fun celebrating

71
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,990
knowledge and celebrating achievement

72
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,570
and science and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really</font>

73
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">wonderful at the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time even if we</font>

74
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,829
didn't have this this conference and

75
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,930
this get together right now you don't go

76
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">home</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from work and sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the couch and</font>

77
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,560
watch reality television every night you

78
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,690
go home from work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you pick up</font>

79
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,470
another equally challenging and equally

80
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,660
difficult project and you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

81
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,550
something that you kind of put all of

82
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,660
your life force in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pursuit of doing</font>

83
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,700
something new doing something

84
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,990
interesting and not just keeping it to

85
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,709
yourself but actually sharing that

86
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,840
knowledge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I often think of</font>

87
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,700
hackaday being an apprenticeship program

88
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's people that are learning amazing</font>

89
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,238
things at a very high level oftentimes

90
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,590
working with others they've come before

91
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,010
them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then looking for a way to pass</font>

92
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:23,840
that on I also look at hackaday as being

93
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:25,730
a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a science society a place</font>

94
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">where people get together to discuss</font>

95
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,930
things because it's important that we

96
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,600
understand them and we grasp them and

97
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,270
that we use that interaction among peers

98
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,270
and among people who are gaining through

99
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,710
the ranks of knowledge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> skill to</font>

100
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,359
create new leaps forward in<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

101
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,570
able to do and what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pass</font>

102
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,500
on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people coming behind us and</font>

103
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,240
that's something that you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

104
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,450
everywhere and it is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons</font>

105
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,669
why you find so many people willing to

106
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and pack this room and so many</font>

107
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:57,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">speakers willing to kind of share that</font>

108
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,390
knowledge as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well hackaday is alive with</font>

109
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,160
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who find that something doesn't</font>

110
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,979
exist and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then decide that they're going</font>

111
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,590
to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so inherently they look</font>

112
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,419
at a problem of has somebody done this

113
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,039
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when the answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is no it</font>

114
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:12,409
never stops there it always<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes on to</font>

115
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:16,010
the next thing but at the same time I

116
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:18,260
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right now we're still in kind</font>

117
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,680
of the the stone<font color="#CCCCCC"> Age's the dark ages of</font>

118
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,349
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inner</font>

119
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,860
it's this tool that has grown up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

120
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,210
become very amazing but new interactions

121
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,490
and new ways to work collaboratively

122
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">with each other using the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is</font>

123
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ultimate tool are still being</font>

124
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,530
developed and that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

125
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,270
that's really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Hackett a</font>

126
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,179
community really important with what

127
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:40,130
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing with a cadet i/o which is</font>

128
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,810
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find people ways to put people</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">together one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things we've been</font>

130
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:47,630
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hackaday is on finding</font>

131
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,880
and building your<font color="#E5E5E5"> dream team so you</font>

132
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">never have every skill that you need all</font>

133
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,210
at one time it may be that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

134
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,830
at mechanical we can need something to

135
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,229
do electronic or you're great at both of

136
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,609
those need someone to do design or you

137
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:00,800
need multiple people in all of those

138
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,050
things and the internet is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,169
ultimate achievement unlocker for that

140
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,300
because the the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are in your</font>

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,150
but when you want to go work on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,949
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've already moved on to a</font>

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,650
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use the internet as a</font>

148
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,349
multiplier for that and that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

149
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">what hackaday</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2io has been all about and</font>

150
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:25,340
in order to try and help<font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage that</font>

151
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:27,199
sort of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> excited that</font>

152
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,698
this is the third year of the hackaday

153
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,789
prize which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to incentivize</font>

154
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:33,440
people to really look at the skills that

155
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:34,849
they have and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> team's they can put</font>

156
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">together and try to build something that</font>

157
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:39,800
matters build something that could maybe

158
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,099
spark the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and move the entire</font>

159
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,349
world ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> move humanity ahead and so</font>

160
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:47,330
even if the internet is still kind of in

161
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:49,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dark ages I think that this</font>

162
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,130
community of people and their

163
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,419
willingness to work together and to

164
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,460
share knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> with each other it's</font>

165
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:57,680
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Enlightenment and we're going</font>

166
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see the uses of the internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

167
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">use is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people across on</font>

168
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:04,669
long distances grow and grow and grow

169
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,349
and what else can I say it's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

170
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:08,840
be part of it I'm a true believer in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

171
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:10,400
and I definitely wouldn't be here if I

172
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,530
didn't think it was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen</font>

173
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,870
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all of us so I think one big</font>

174
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,599
part of that people are often asking you

175
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,310
know you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how can I help out this</font>

176
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,110
sort of thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think documenting what</font>

177
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,050
you're working on no matter how mundane

178
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,870
on it is is incredibly important so I

179
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,020
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as you do you work write</font>

180
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,330
it down take pictures

181
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,830
listed somewhere a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

182
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,568
well no one wants to see this we got to

183
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,370
remember every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single day someone sees</font>

184
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:40,840
the same thing you are doing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

185
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,909
fruit but it for them it's the first

186
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,739
time they've never seen it before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

187
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:47,139
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put in a pitch this isn't</font>

188
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,960
all altruistic either so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might write</font>

189
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,310
it down and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know my reasoning might</font>

190
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,719
be go out and teach someone else a<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

191
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,120
thing but it ends up becoming your

192
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,039
engineering journal as well and so five

193
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,810
years from<font color="#E5E5E5"> now when you have an amazing</font>

194
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,789
achievement and everyone's saying hey

195
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,349
can you come to my conference and talk

196
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:04,690
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work that you've done you've</font>

197
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:07,330
got this entire back<font color="#E5E5E5"> catalogue of notes</font>

198
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,130
and pictures and development logs and I

199
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,568
think that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like I said one of</font>

200
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">those things that moves the internet</font>

201
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:15,909
this archival power that we have in

202
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,130
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share with other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people is only</font>

203
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:19,870
good if you're actually doing the

204
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,240
documentation as you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out these</font>

205
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,639
things so consider that in your future

206
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,199
builds I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things are not new</font>

207
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,479
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of where hackaday has</font>

208
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,460
always been but at this point we're

209
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,770
seeing that that growth is really taking

210
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,838
off we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more people that</font>

211
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:38,649
are interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in coming to a conference</font>

212
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:40,990
like this going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one night set of</font>

213
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:43,208
lightning talks or sometimes there's a

214
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,490
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> meetup that happens at the supply</font>

215
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:47,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">mer supply frame office in San Francisco</font>

216
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,779
called the hardware developers didactic

217
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">galactic where they get people from all</font>

218
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:55,240
different parts of engineering to come

219
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,500
in and give a 20-30 minute talk mixed in

220
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">with some lightning talks about what</font>

221
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,160
they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it happens about once a</font>

222
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,829
month it's really amazing this last

223
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,899
November we did our first super

224
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:07,630
conference also in San Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> and had</font>

225
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:10,630
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-day event on this is a natural</font>

226
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,939
growth of that is similar in scope and

227
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:16,029
scale of that event and both amazingly

228
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:19,149
successful the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we would like to</font>

229
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:22,209
see people empowered to do this in more

230
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:23,529
than just once a year in one part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

231
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:26,800
world that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you can get to maybe</font>

232
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:28,660
you can't so I would encourage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

233
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,760
look into the program that so if we

234
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,500
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> already it's called</font>

235
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,600
hackaday meetups its local meetups we're

236
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,730
encouraging people that are already

237
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cadet community and</font>

238
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to see who else in their area is</font>

239
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,120
also excited about it to get together do

240
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,350
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> as often or as infrequently as</font>

241
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,110
you want but the four

242
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,660
one is we're a kadai world create day

243
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,730
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> April 23rd we're putting</font>

244
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">together hackaday meetups all over the</font>

245
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,540
world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> having people get together and</font>

246
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,120
have one day of engineering

247
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,099
brainstorming to kind of empower the

248
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,630
people who didn't know others in the

249
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,850
neighborhood we're doing the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

250
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,460
of things that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did and you know if</font>

251
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,920
you want more information on that go to

252
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,720
Hecate I oh and look up world create day

253
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,790
or talk to anyone of the hackaday crew

254
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,660
we have a great night ahead of us so

255
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:19,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't go anywhere the next thing up is</font>

256
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,000
dinner<font color="#E5E5E5"> and right at nine thirty we're</font>

257
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,680
going to be starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bands please</font>

258
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,050
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> free to stay in this area there is</font>

259
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be some sound check but there's</font>

260
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,819
really no reason to go outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's much</font>

261
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,830
better here and much more fun and badge

262
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,290
hacking is going to happen in in the

263
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,630
workshop area and all over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the place so</font>

264
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,050
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for coming today and long live</font>
