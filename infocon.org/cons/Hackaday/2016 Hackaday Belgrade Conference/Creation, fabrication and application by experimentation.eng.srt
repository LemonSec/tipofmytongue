1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:17,640
so our next speaker is I saw that we

2
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,890
were we were drinking last night at a

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,119
you know like some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bart voter stunts and</font>

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,699
then I was introducing Soviet to some

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,099
people and I just had like this is

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sophie she's awesome so that's that's</font>

7
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,330
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> all I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say like Sophie</font>

8
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:35,519
someone that they joined our team like a

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,890
year now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in December 2014 and what</font>

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,300
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is so we were you know we did</font>

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,899
hyper the price for the first year it

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,910
was it was a awesome experience but in a

13
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,530
lot of us were like<font color="#E5E5E5"> very deeply involved</font>

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,419
and you know we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font>

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,070
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take care of so we so we said</font>

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,860
okay we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hire someone that's</font>

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,840
going to really Drive this but we it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,030
really hard to it was really hard to

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,550
come up with a with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> job description</font>

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,890
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's someone that's an engineer</font>

21
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,538
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you can talk with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people and very</font>

22
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,280
creative and all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

23
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,290
like a so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we said always kind of like a</font>

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,990
unicorn so we we put out an article on

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,720
hackaday<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you know searching for a</font>

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,100
unicorn and then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> somehow you</font>

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,080
know Sophie showed up and she's really

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,580
inner transform so a lot of what we you

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,548
know as I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mentioned you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,990
have been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to evolve the heck day</font>

31
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:27,090
editorial and the hack of the culture to

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,789
just go from beyond pure entertainment

33
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,920
to what brand bench of calls a grad

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,329
school for hackers so just really trying

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with a Content that like</font>

36
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,919
elevates the you know the discussion and

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,960
it's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not just how to link</font>

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,000
an LED and then you know and then your

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,380
armor maker but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know rather you know</font>

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
how do we build you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the kind of</font>

41
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,408
things that people do in grad school you

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,729
know solving hard problems and another

43
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,130
and other piece that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

44
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,929
interesting for me is is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the art</font>

45
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,520
side of things because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need a lot of</font>

46
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,990
cases there are only so many engineering

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,908
applications but one you explode to the

48
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,259
world of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world of art you know</font>

49
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,000
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many there are so many</font>

50
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,640
exciting opportunities for creation and

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,649
if you guys are around in a city for

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,210
next week there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing festival</font>

53
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,979
here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Belgrade called resonate that's</font>

54
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,008
all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know digital art and</font>

55
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,710
things like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway so sophie is</font>

56
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,630
someone that

57
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">he combines both with his world so she's</font>

58
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,769
at the same time in an amazing

59
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,530
accomplished artist as well as a real

60
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,620
hardcore professional hardware engineer

61
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:26,500
and and so she really brought up a whole

62
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,050
unique point of view to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our</font>

63
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,280
community and just me personally I you

64
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,350
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't be happier working with</font>

65
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,130
her so give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to applause</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

66
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,130
Sophie credits

67
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:49,280
Thanks hi I'm Sophie that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a nice</font>

68
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,290
introduction Alec this talk has a really

69
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,120
long name because I had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with</font>

70
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the name of a talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two months ago</font>

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,540
so I just kind of made something up

72
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,340
based on what I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on at the</font>

73
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:03,709
time so we're just going to skip to the

74
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:05,300
next slide hi this is my first time

75
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,040
being in this part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world I love</font>

76
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,560
traveling I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been all over the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,840
and when I came on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to supply frame like</font>

78
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,880
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> said in the first presentation I was</font>

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,500
like yes when<font color="#CCCCCC"> can I come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Belgrade</font>

80
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,840
there's a Belgrade office I want to come

81
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,170
so I'm pretty excited to be here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

82
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,720
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all are here too so a</font>

83
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,089
little bit about my background one of

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,340
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like doing a lot is</font>

85
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,849
building collaborative projects that are

86
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,549
interactive art and I typically work in

87
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:36,130
I come from an industrial engineering

88
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:38,750
background where I typically work with

89
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">mechanical engineers and software</font>

90
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,340
engineers together when I'm working on a

91
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,950
new art project which they're typically

92
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,920
really large in scale I try to work with

93
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,480
a mechanical person which oftentimes is

94
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,760
my husband Oliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> tanner he's a</font>

95
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,679
mechanical fabricator and you'll see me

96
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,569
online a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times begging in forums</font>

97
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,040
for help writing software so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

98
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,630
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk much about what I did last</font>

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,510
year but i'll just show a couple of the

100
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,980
types of projects that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did last year</font>

101
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">around this time last year i completed a</font>

102
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:12,500
project called breathe breathe is 25

103
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:14,750
balloons and they are to represent

104
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,389
pixels when the balloon is deflated it's

105
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:20,810
off and when they're inflated they're on

106
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:23,570
this project<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a two foot by two foot a</font>

107
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,610
box that's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight inches wide and</font>

108
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,950
the vision was to have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

109
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,440
boxes on a wall that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would inflate and</font>

110
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,169
deflate as you walked by perhaps powered

111
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">by a connect or some kind of camera so</font>

112
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:38,120
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 solenoids crammed into this</font>

113
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,950
box with a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hoses and the</font>

114
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,410
reason for that was that the inflate and

115
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,330
deflate rate on one solenoid turned out

116
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,490
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> really different so we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

117
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,950
source much bigger solenoids for a

118
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,190
deflate rate with a larger aperture so

119
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,289
you can imagine how

120
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,060
much of a pain in the ass this was

121
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:59,310
cramming all of that stuff into a two

122
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:01,050
foot by two foot box second project that

123
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,120
I worked on last year I started in about

124
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,620
March and there were nine people<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

125
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">together that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked on it was called</font>

126
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,030
loquacious and lovely there are two

127
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:12,450
unicorns they weigh about 400 pounds

128
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:16,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">each and they're made up of welded steel</font>

129
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:18,750
cnc cut wood and laser cut wood and we

130
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,070
did some of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a water jet the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basis</font>

131
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:26,670
which are cut with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the water jet weigh</font>

132
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:28,409
250 pounds each and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are custom I</font>

133
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,890
don't do much work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> LEDs at all and</font>

134
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,900
these LEDs were taken from another

135
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,479
project called dome star which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

136
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,820
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my friends in New York and they</font>

137
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,620
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cannibalize don't star because</font>

138
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,909
don't star was so popular it had been

139
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,340
all around the world and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

140
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:48,810
make a new version of it so I inherited

141
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:50,190
about a quarter kilo of LEDs and like

142
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,840
four controllers which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

143
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,040
amazing so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just changed the</font>

144
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">controllers a little bit to take a</font>

145
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,310
different voltage and work on batteries

146
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,560
and put a battery a stop circuit in it

147
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,120
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what I want to talk about is</font>

148
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,370
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the projects I'm working on</font>

149
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,840
currently and I'm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when you're</font>

150
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,570
working on a project and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in</font>

151
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,359
progress it's it's a pretty favorite

152
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,550
part for me because the project<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

153
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,770
so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some kind of a plan</font>

154
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,150
and it's not finished so you can't

155
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,299
really look back and be like oh that

156
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:24,270
project sucked so first project<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

157
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,850
working on has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with polarizer film</font>

158
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,560
and I think I don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

159
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,150
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen this demonstration before it's</font>

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,690
like something from a high<font color="#CCCCCC"> school</font>

161
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:36,469
physics class polarizer is plastic film

162
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:39,510
that has some kind of material that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

163
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:42,419
scraped on to it when it is two pieces

164
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,310
are held in parallel light gets through

165
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:47,190
that's kind of like a selfie that I took

166
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,200
holding these two<font color="#CCCCCC"> pieces of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> film when</font>

167
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,110
they are at 45 degrees half the light

168
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,940
gets through and at 90 degrees none of

169
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,790
the light gets through so somewhere

170
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,479
between zero degrees as in parallel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

171
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,300
90 degrees as in at right angles to each

172
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,310
other you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

173
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,250
variation of light getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> through in</font>

174
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,289
intensity and on the bottom that's just

175
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,360
a diagram I swap I<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab from a physics</font>

176
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:12,740
website and it shows ambient light like

177
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,870
what we have here in this room and

178
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,639
everywhere it's unpolarized it flies

179
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,039
everywhere it has a direction you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

180
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,830
picture it Connor I like a big circle

181
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,110
and once it goes through a polarizer its

182
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,479
main<font color="#CCCCCC"> direction is in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> direction of</font>

183
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,539
the polarizer so you've all seen

184
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,430
polarizer on sunglasses and i'm showing

185
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:33,860
here glare on a window where I'm

186
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,319
rotating a piece of polarizer film and

187
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,090
you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the glare disappearing and</font>

188
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,190
coming back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's probably the</font>

189
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">easiest way to explain how a pair of</font>

190
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,210
sunglasses works so this was going

191
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">around on an email chain at hackaday</font>

192
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,960
last week and I thought it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really had a</font>

193
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:50,719
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of relation to the projects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

194
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:55,219
working on so we see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 degrees and</font>

195
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:58,039
the light is blocked so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff</font>

196
00:07:55,219 --> 00:08:00,349
spawned an email chain of I don't know

197
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:02,509
nine or ten emails of how does this work

198
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:04,969
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like not what we expect to</font>

199
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:06,919
see right we have GPS as a polarizer

200
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:08,750
that are at ninety degrees no light is

201
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:12,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting through and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you stick one</font>

202
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:14,750
in the middle at 45 degrees and some of

203
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,909
the light gets through so this is

204
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,639
exactly what I showed before this is how

205
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:22,550
it works you have somewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> between 0</font>

206
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,009
and 90 degrees some amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of light</font>

207
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,960
intensity will get through and it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

208
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,969
explained of course by math which is a

209
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,620
little bit beyond anything I can explain

210
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:32,360
but it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> malice law and you can</font>

211
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,549
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up if you're really interested</font>

212
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much light is</font>

213
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:39,348
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> through but in the previous</font>

214
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:41,450
thing if it's exactly 45 degrees it's

215
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:44,720
about a quarter of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> light intensity</font>

216
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:47,000
the polarizer project that I'm loosely

217
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,770
working on will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be exhibited in Toronto</font>

218
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,860
next week and it's called 288 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

219
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:58,519
288 pieces of polarizer film that are

220
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,769
mounted on 288 servo motors and if

221
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,600
you've ever heard a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> silver</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moto a</font>

222
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:05,839
hobby servo motor you can imagine how

223
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool 288 of these things sound</font>

224
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,260
altogether I feel like I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

225
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,110
a sound installation out of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

226
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,370
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I was there last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> week helping to</font>

227
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,649
work on it I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do much just</font>

228
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,569
aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

229
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:19,240
our supplies but that's what they look

230
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:21,269
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the box to 400 servos because</font>

231
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,790
some of them don't work of course and

232
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:27,129
this is us working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project in the</font>

233
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,439
Toronto studia so the second project

234
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:31,959
that I've just started working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on has to</font>

235
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:34,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">do with liquid crystals and I think we</font>

236
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,489
all know liquid crystals because they're

237
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:38,610
in our phones there in our meters there

238
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:42,040
on your honor computers they're

239
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,079
everywhere looking around online you

240
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,379
know as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do I came across this Jeff</font>

241
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:49,989
in about two thousand eleven and it's

242
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:52,629
from a company called a you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

243
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:56,170
original name called liquid crystal

244
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:59,259
technologies and they're located in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ohio</font>

245
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,509
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle or mid to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> East United</font>

246
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:05,019
States and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a small company it's</font>

247
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:07,600
made up of an engineer a scientist and a

248
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:09,100
salesperson and the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

249
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,139
allowed to speak to their is the

250
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,389
salesperson and the sales person tells

251
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:15,369
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're engineers are mean and</font>

252
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:21,459
crabby and we don't let them talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

253
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:25,749
customers so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a bit of a</font>

254
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:27,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem because oh actually I also want</font>

255
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:31,329
to say liquid crystal I mean the that

256
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,740
exact type of liquid crystal is also

257
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:36,248
available in something called smart

258
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,980
glass in SmartGlass runs at 120 to 240

259
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:41,410
volts<font color="#CCCCCC"> AC and it's used it's called</font>

260
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,660
privacy glass or smart glass and this is

261
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,689
a building<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I admired tremendously</font>

262
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,730
it's by Sir Norman Foster and it's in

263
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:52,269
London<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the idea behind this building</font>

264
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:54,160
when they architected it in 2004 was to

265
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:56,379
have a lot of conference rooms that were

266
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,219
could be turned on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and turned off for</font>

267
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:02,049
privacy so again with this salesperson

268
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,420
just to come back to that story I called

269
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:06,730
them up and I'm like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font>

270
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that they tell me it runs at under 20</font>

271
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,199
volts which is great I don't like

272
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:14,769
hacking on 120 or 240 and you guys

273
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:18,549
shouldn't either so they sent me this

274
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:20,949
when I asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sample and two pieces</font>

275
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:22,809
of polarizer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sandwich</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece of</font>

276
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:24,758
glass two pieces of glass with some

277
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:27,250
smushy stuff in the middle no wires no

278
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:31,510
documentation like<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

279
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:33,220
so you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I'm starting to</font>

280
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,930
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this company is really not</font>

281
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,790
taking me seriously because I keep

282
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,310
calling and I'm like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know more</font>

283
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,560
about how this works<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what exact</font>

284
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,939
voltage work does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it work on temperature</font>

285
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,579
range all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and they're</font>

286
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,110
just not giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that information so</font>

287
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,580
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like can you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just send me something</font>

288
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,180
that's assembled and I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

289
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just reverse engineer it so just</font>

290
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,339
to say how these things go together it's

291
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,500
two pieces of polarizer on either side

292
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:03,010
of the glass and it's kind of a sandwich

293
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,690
excuse my very bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> CAD work here and in</font>

294
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,150
the middle is this mushy stuff the

295
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,130
liquid crystal which has its got like

296
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:12,040
the viscosity of toothpaste or some kind

297
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:14,380
of a gel this is what they sent me when

298
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,089
I asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for something assembled which I</font>

299
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,240
think it's pretty neat I drew a smiley

300
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:23,220
face behind it for this presentation

301
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:26,170
it's being run by an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino there's a</font>

302
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,380
the black lead is attached to ground and

303
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,599
the red lead is attached to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PWM pin on</font>

304
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,370
an Arduino and I'm just running like I

305
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,750
said I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not I don't write software at</font>

306
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,050
all so I'm just running an example

307
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,540
something like analog right 255 20 and

308
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,880
blinking back and forth but i think this

309
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,219
this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really inspiring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me just to</font>

310
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,210
see this thing work but you know we've

311
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,830
all seen this too um Mike's dish said

312
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,720
before he has all these old cell phones

313
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,540
i'm sure some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have dead displays</font>

314
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">i am also a fan of keeping all of my old</font>

315
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,370
electronics many of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> have dead</font>

316
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:03,160
displays and you can tell you know when

317
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:05,830
your LCD is dying because you get black

318
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,589
spots you get discoloration your letters

319
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:12,160
are fading or like this very extreme

320
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:15,130
example that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i found somewhere and this</font>

321
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,250
has a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of discoloration so you</font>

322
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,140
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> LCDs can die because the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the power</font>

323
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,600
system goes bad or the controller trip

324
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,300
goes bad but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was really more</font>

325
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,650
specifically interested in what makes

326
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:32,740
the LCD go bad itself so just as an

327
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:35,199
aside while I was researching this and a

328
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,780
whole new industry is popped up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

329
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,030
called replacing cell phone screens so

330
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,100
if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at bro</font>

331
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:44,100
cell phone screens you'll find I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

332
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:47,310
know 15 to 20 types of equipment ranging

333
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,050
from this hand of this hand one to ones

334
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are industrial sized and they're</font>

335
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,849
all dedicated to repairing iphone

336
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,470
screens I mean I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't even imagine</font>

337
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:59,540
that there's a whole industry in

338
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:02,460
repairing phone screens but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

339
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:05,280
characterizing this LCD screen I knew

340
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the three most important things</font>

341
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,449
where temperature drive signal and power

342
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,480
level and temperature is a function of

343
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:16,410
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> liquid crystal medium itself that's</font>

344
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,960
in between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> glass just by by a</font>

345
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,480
function of what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it definitely has</font>

346
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,940
to be between 0 and 50 degrees<font color="#CCCCCC"> see if</font>

347
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,890
it's too cold like if i leave my meter

348
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,330
in the car it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> forever for it to</font>

349
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,490
turn on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm sure many of you have</font>

350
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,110
experienced that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with things that you</font>

351
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,990
leave in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car if you're in a cold</font>

352
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:36,090
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world if it gets too hot it</font>

353
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:39,030
gets a little bit running<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the</font>

354
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:41,340
edges so of course manufacturers make

355
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:44,939
things at a wider temperature range but

356
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:48,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero to 50 is something that's a given</font>

357
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,240
you it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> always be there the power</font>

358
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,650
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> this salesperson really also</font>

359
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,460
wouldn't tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know he's like</font>

360
00:14:52,650 --> 00:15:00,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere in between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 and 20 volts I</font>

361
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:03,240
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> really super unhelpful the drive</font>

362
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:05,610

363
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,470
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> before with ground and an</font>

364
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">arduino pin you know that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

365
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:12,060
work if you give an LCD any kind of DC

366
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,660
whatsoever you'll kill it and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

367
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:18,270
that discoloration so I set out to

368
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,569
figure out what all these things were

369
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,340
with my LCD screen the temperature thing

370
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,680
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the oven and I saw get</font>

371
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,050
runny and it was fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we'll just like</font>

372
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,510
skip over the temperature thing again

373
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:33,410
from sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of high school physics class</font>

374
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:36,150
just how these things actually work

375
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,400
liquid crystal comes in a twisted form

376
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,740
and light gets through all the time the

377
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,470
polarizer is it's only there isn't like

378
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helps with the opacity so you'll</font>

379
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">always see polarizer on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> liquid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> crystal</font>

380
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:51,660
display and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just so that</font>

381
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:54,089
there's more dark when you put power on

382
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,569
the liquid crystal medium it untwist

383
00:15:54,090 --> 00:16:01,830
gets a direction and blocks the light so

384
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:04,200
I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> down a mega serious rabbit hole</font>

385
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,900
on this physics and chemistry are not

386
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">really my background but I really wanted</font>

387
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,060
to understand the liquid crystal medium

388
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,770
itself and how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> DC power kill it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

389
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,949
you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all over the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

390
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:19,770
DC power kills it but like about why so

391
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:23,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">reddit I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found one thing on reddit and</font>

392
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:25,890
the explanation<font color="#CCCCCC"> given was that at AC the</font>

393
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:30,329
liquid crystal medium bounces around it

394
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:32,760
oscillates a lot and under DC it goes to

395
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:36,270
one side of the glass and stays there

396
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:39,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">causing this discoloration but to get</font>

397
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:43,230
further into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually what is inside</font>

398
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:46,770
of a liquid<font color="#CCCCCC"> crystal is a like a rosin</font>

399
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,360
rosin columns kind of sheet that's put

400
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,620
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and it's made out of a</font>

401
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,680
semiconductor process called

402
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,670
photolithography so these things are

403
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:59,489
made out of itor indium tin oxide and

404
00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:02,520
indium tin oxide is clear when it starts

405
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,380
out but under DC power it will discolor

406
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,470
so that was pretty much good enough for

407
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,170
me that's like basic chemistry

408
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:13,440
explanation and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to show how to</font>

409
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,480
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into the real world how a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7</font>

410
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,130

411
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">most common thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we all work with</font>

412
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:25,530
LCD was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed before how when you put</font>

413
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:29,580
power on an LCD it gets opaque and for a

414
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:32,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">7 segment display</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the indium tin oxide</font>

415
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,860
electrodes are laid out in this kind of

416
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:37,190
a pattern so you put power on it and you

417
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,229
will get some form of number that's

418
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:43,800
decided by the controller I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

419
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:47,660
also figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to fade these things</font>

420
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:51,300
they're mostly shown in<font color="#CCCCCC"> on/off</font>

421
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,890
configurations like I think the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

422
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,320
the things that's in is like video

423
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,050
gallows 3d goggles and they're on off

424
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,090
all the time and fading of course using

425
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:02,730
like a fade sketch for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino</font>

426
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,389
doesn't work because you have DC again

427
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">into your signal</font>

428
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:19,720
I had to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> another way and so yay for</font>

429
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:21,790
fading and I mean it might seem obvious

430
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,040
but it definitely wasn't obvious to me

431
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:26,470
to fade these things you give it an

432
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,800
analog voltage and the number turns out

433
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:32,320
to be about 1.3 to two point two point

434
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,980
one if I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get really exact</font>

435
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,649
about it and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> lcds they're all</font>

436
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,890
different but mine turn up they turn on

437
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:44,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">get completely dark at about 4.3 so</font>

438
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,630
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really really small window</font>

439
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,520
and I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about I'm still</font>

440
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,280
thinking about making an art piece with

441
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,500
hundreds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these so putting a fading</font>

442
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,210
circuit on each one is a little it's a

443
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,130
little bit daunting honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

444
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:01,840
like some kind of op-amp circuit on

445
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:03,340
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single one inch piece of glass so</font>

446
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,129
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a little animation i made</font>

447
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,230
up to kind of think about how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

448
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,840
look to have hundreds of these to play

449
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tetris on I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be pretty</font>

450
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,699
neat or to build a three-dimensional

451
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,530
sculpture I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would also be</font>

452
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,360
pretty neat probably not going to do any

453
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,399
fading it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably going to be on and</font>

454
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,169
off because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually think that making</font>

455
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,780
them fade unless you if you don't do it

456
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:29,800
really well it looks like it's broken so

457
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:32,530
in closing I thanks for being here again

458
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,570
I love collaborating with other people

459
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:37,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">especially people who write software and</font>

460
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:40,149
do data stuff so you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> me all the</font>

461
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,060
time on hackaday I oh I pretty much

462
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:46,050
lived there as some people say and i'm

463
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,050
on twitter thank you
