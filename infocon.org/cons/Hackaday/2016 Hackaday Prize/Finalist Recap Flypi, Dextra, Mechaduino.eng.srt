1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,170
the low-cost open-source industrial

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,410
servomotor Mehcad we know features a 14

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,170
bit magnetic encoder for precision

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,740
position feedback true closed-loop

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,720
control rejects disturbances in addition

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,090
to closed-loop position control

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,210
Mehcad we know features velocity torque

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,308
and user definable modes

9
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,329
I love closed-loop control systems and I

10
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:37,860
can still remember the first time I

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,620
built some kind of closed-loop you know

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,710
thing it was a it was like a DIY a laser

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,170
projector and so I was using the hard

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,660
disk voice coils and some little optical

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,579
sensors to provide feedback and the

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,620
first time I had a piece of code which

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,449
was acting like a spring and I could

18
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:55,980
kind of push on it and feel the force

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,559
response and actually have this physical

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,809
system which was responding to this

21
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,820
equation that I typed in to an IDE

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,470
somewhere you know that was a really

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,080
cool experience and it just requires so

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,670
many steps because it's not just you

25
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,220
know blinking an LED it's having inputs

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,020
and outputs and loop and it has to be

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,970
fast enough and it's really easy to

28
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,890
break the hardware if your control loop

29
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,479
isn't working properly we need to first

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,640
test it so it's this whole sequence of

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,409
things any one of which could cause you

32
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,509
to kind of want to give up and so it's

33
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:25,979
really great to see a project to come

34
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,720
out and hit what I think might be a

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,060
sweet spot between you know having

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,710
having something that's easy to use but

37
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,689
also really powerful and isn't going to

38
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,159
break the bank because I think they've

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,960
taken a pretty novel approach to reuse

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,060
readily available components to make a

41
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,729
really nice product and sometimes I

42
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,560
think people can easily dismiss

43
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,899
simplicity I just thought my per second

44
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,189
Arduino with like a stepper motor

45
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,869
controller on it and it can't even do

46
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,820
other stuff sometimes you have to just

47
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,130
execute simplicity well to make sure

48
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,329
that it's usable for lots of different

49
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,720
people

50
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:03,600
the fly by itself is is another it's an

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,640
automated science platform wrapped

52
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:16,200
around microscopic but anyway um so it's

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,530
it's all about automating the science

54
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,380
and so it has like you know like a light

55
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,739
source interface it's God's motion

56
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,120
control if you need to change your

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,010
aspects and it's got a logging cake as

58
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,150
well so you can get you can take like a

59
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,580
series of readings and measurements over

60
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,450
time so what I like about fly pie is

61
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,299
that they give you some tools for setup

62
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,160
and you can choose which tools you want

63
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,780
to build into your project and you know

64
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,670
they it's sort of modular that you can

65
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,410
add the parts that you're interested in

66
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,090
and not the parts that you might not

67
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,430
need or you know build on what you have

68
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,760
and the idea that you can do it all

69
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,090
low-cost wherever you are with the tools

70
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,400
you have on here but also they've gone

71
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,170
the extra mile to say you know the

72
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,000
experimental setup pass and I don't know

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,260
how else you've described that better

74
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,720
but essentially they've got specific

75
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,489
experiments they can do with the setup

76
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,769
so to do with the you know the

77
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:21,630
wavelength and frequency of the light

78
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,250
they've got specific tests to look for

79
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,170
specific parasites and do various other

80
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,600
scientific testing so I thought that was

81
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,239
quite in you know taking the USB webcam

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,880
microscope thing to the next level and

83
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,170
actually saying it's applied to these

84
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,209
things and situations the developing

85
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,049
world and so on

86
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,959
even open sir

87
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,040
and open my own ethnic and one of the

88
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,290
key features of texture is it says which

89
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,410
is the size of an average male half I

90
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,000
really wanted to make it compact with

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,130
all the activators electronics and bed

92
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,950
inside so that any amputee with any

93
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,489
level of computation could use it the

94
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,380
key to the compact size of dextra is

95
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,270
it's designed based on finger modules

96
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,570
its module comprises a media a DC motor

97
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,820
position feedback provided by magnetic

98
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,860
encoder and the mechanical printable

99
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,680
finger I was really impressed by it by

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,200
this hand particularly because of the

101
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,100
ability for it to have a dexterity to

102
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,570
pick up many different things and the

103
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,520
video is well documented vo showing the

104
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,290
ability of this pickup swishy things and

105
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,560
a hard thing yet doing it on a

106
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,150
well-documented but really low-cost

107
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,940
system it's probably dating myself but

108
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,530
when I was taking when I was learning

109
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,780
grass ups and in robotics classes 15

110
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,330
years ago you know these systems were

111
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,060
really complicated and really expensive

112
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,770
scale I picked something up with the

113
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,660
precision and the reliability that

114
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,740
they're showing in this video so the

115
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,570
fact that someone could actually take

116
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,160
these instructions and go and built this

117
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,520
it was pretty shocking to me and the

118
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,650
video you can see the Creator putting

119
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,630
the whole thing together you know in

120
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,030
time-lapse but still 26 minutes to put

121
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,880
the whole hand together and I also like

122
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,030
the fact that there's force feedback or

123
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,010
at least motion feedback control so if

124
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,630
you grip something the hand knows that

125
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,610
it's you know cryptid out I think that's

126
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,960
actually a new feature that I hadn't

127
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,780
seen in sort of DIY prosthetics
