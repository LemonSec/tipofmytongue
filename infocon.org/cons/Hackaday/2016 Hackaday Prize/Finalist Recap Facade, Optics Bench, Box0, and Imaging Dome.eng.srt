1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,400
herschel optics holders are expensive so

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,530
i made a holder and ring system using a

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,380
laser cutter and some common hardware

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,849
the holes are threaded take cap head

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,070
screws and they stick to magnets in the

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,920
Rings this works pretty well you can

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,570
adjust the aim up down and left right

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,640
and the ring doesn't slide around or

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,550
fall off you can put magnets in the

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,619
holders for better stability all most of

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,470
the time these aren't needed the kit

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,270
lets you examine and prototype all the

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,590
common optics functions such as

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,710
projection magnification and even

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,780
advanced laser effects such as the

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,719
Michelson interferometer shown here so

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,760
just that this project is instructions

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,190
and files to create your own optics

19
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,829
bench using a laser cutter so trying to

20
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,920
make some high-end experiments fairly

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,079
accessible to anyone who has a laser

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,390
cutter for me what was really neat about

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,070
this project is that it's incredibly

24
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,680
well documented it was easy to read all

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,670
very well photo documented but a lot of

26
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,500
effort was put by this team to show

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,290
their full process and the pros and cons

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,540
it left me wanting to run over to my

29
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,920
laser cutter and make an optics bench

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,720
which wasn't something that I really

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,670
ever had on my to-do list which is sort

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,369
of needs anything for a project to leave

33
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,320
the website thinking on out now I can

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,680
either have those tools I can make this

35
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,549
so the new thing is I take a lot of

36
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,020
classrooms that wouldn't normally think

37
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,490
about this and I say classrooms I mean

38
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,420
it loosely I'm this to be your

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,950
makerspace this could be a college

40
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,240
classroom this could be something that

41
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,380
you're doing into the high school

42
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,409
physics class really acknowledging that

43
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,899
this is typically a a pretty pricey set

44
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:46,560
to tools and the prices that that this

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,030
project are quoting really do come in

46
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,290
under hundred dollars and create this

47
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,220
we introduce assault a cross swords

48
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,140
fabrication pipeline to how blind people

49
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,180
independently make physical interfaces

50
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,210
accessible blind users capture a photo

51
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,310
of the inaccessible interface with a

52
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,580
dollar bill for absolute measurements

53
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,709
these labels are then used to generate a

54
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,870
3d model for a layer of tactile and

55
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,880
principal buttons that fits over the

56
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,060
original controls the printed overlay is

57
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,980
designed to be easily aligned and

58
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,050
attached to its appliance using

59
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,950
adhesives so basically it's to help

60
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,020
people who are blind or partially

61
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,250
sighted generate tactile interfaces for

62
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,500
appliances by themselves which I thought

63
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,910
was a really good innovation so

64
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,010
essentially you stick a dollar bill on

65
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,560
the next your microwave keypad was

66
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,290
example or anything and you scan it with

67
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,410
an iphone app and it goes off and it's

68
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,840
crowd-sourced for people to suggest all

69
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,340
that interface should look like as

70
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,370
Braille or as other symbols and it

71
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,290
basically generates using open source

72
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,570
software as well they're using open s

73
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,430
can or variant of it with I believe with

74
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,739
JavaScript plug-in or something to

75
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:03,799
actually dynamically generate a 3d model

76
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,709
that you can 3d print and then stick on

77
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,299
that interface and then you can

78
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:11,750
obviously feel it to use it and it's so

79
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,640
basically the person you can't see as

80
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,870
long as they can hold their phone and

81
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,340
they know roughly where the appliance is

82
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,380
they effectively can get this thing

83
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,290
generated by themselves I think one of

84
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,130
the things that's going to make it

85
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,420
really cool is that they're going to

86
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,630
develop a library of created interfaces

87
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,700
for a specific appliances that people

88
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,810
can just download and print

89
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,260
poke zero is easy to use just plug it in

90
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,760
the USB board of your smartphone or

91
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,650
computer Louis the software and your

92
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,599
workbench is ready Bob 0 provides

93
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,190
affordable access to an oscilloscope

94
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,680
signal generated power supply spectrum

95
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,660
analyzer sensor interface we all time

96
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,580
data loaded and many other tools there's

97
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,920
a lot of ways in which you can now

98
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,269
replace what used to be really expensive

99
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,209
to a leg an oscilloscope like you you

100
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:57,069
have similar processing power available

101
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,870
now in inexpensive microcontrollers

102
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,819
right but those aren't necessarily

103
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:03,910
products that Agilent or HP or who

104
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,920
tektronix are rolling out like they're

105
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,560
still making like high-end stuff and and

106
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,660
so there's like a real gap there i think

107
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,569
for to be able in a low-cost platform to

108
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:14,709
provide like a lot of kind of

109
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,048
introductory tools that each controls

110
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,548
lab courses as an engineering professor

111
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:22,180
and our equipment is is ridiculously

112
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,100
overpriced and we're running into

113
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,470
constraints with number of students that

114
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,060
we just can physically put into the lab

115
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,240
situation so if i can say by this open

116
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,820
source hardware widget and plug it in

117
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,680
your phone and who the lab remotely i

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,590
think it would have benefits and more

119
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,850
than one way because students get to

120
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,590
learn on their own time in that way and

121
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,350
not just kind of a two hour lab you know

122
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,360
fake hands-on setting

123
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,040
never hold an object at an angle to the

124
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,900
light tilting it back and forth to see

125
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,460
subtle surface details you can't see

126
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,510
when you're looking straight at it

127
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,580
you're taking advantage of the way the

128
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,020
light interacts with those surface

129
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,320
details to make them more easily visible

130
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,060
reflectance transformation imaging RTI

131
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,100
for short is a digital version of this

132
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,230
technique photos are then processed in

133
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,760
software to create a virtual lighting

134
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,650
model so that using the viewer you can

135
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,150
set the lighting ankle to a desired

136
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,020
position to reveal details in the object

137
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,850
with my design up to 64 LEDs are

138
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,050
installed on the inside of a plastic

139
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,140
dome the system sports automated

140
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,790
triggering of the camera shutter in

141
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,040
synchronization with the LEDs for many

142
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,410
different makes of cameras so this

143
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,210
project I was so taken I've never really

144
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,610
thought about pictures museums and how

145
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,650
to get these detailed images and and

146
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,100
seeing the photographs this was really

147
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,970
exciting and I can see I just got back

148
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,290
from a weekend of camping I can see how

149
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,640
having a lot of fun you know looking at

150
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,930
rocks differently using a device like

151
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,780
this this is a neat project that now

152
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,420
opens it up Stu a lot of others science

153
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,410
and art application so um yeah this

154
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,910
seems like really good application of

155
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,070
the technology that's our key out there

156
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,990
and there's some stuff out there that

157
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,940
you can combine in an awful way and add

158
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,370
some software and and now it does

159
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,220
something really amazing and and even

160
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,740
more so I see this as being you know a

161
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,870
unique offering from the kind of open

162
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,610
source world so you wouldn't you

163
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,020
wouldn't really see this from industry

164
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,190
and if you did it would be

165
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,020
astronomically expensive it wouldn't be

166
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,960
accessible to everyone so yeah I feel

167
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,370
like this is one of those projects that

168
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,800
