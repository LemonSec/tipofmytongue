1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,160
how do you teach a five-year-old to play

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,969
the harmonica well at my kindergarten we

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,799
use a big poster on the wall that looks

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,250
something like this the teacher points

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,340
to the square and says though ray me

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,279
there's got to be a better way so I came

7
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,060
up with this the classroom music

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,210
teaching aid something to help kids and

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,730
how to play the harmonica let's turn it

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,020
on and see what happens I like this

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,760
project a lot because it started with a

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,910
really focused problem and so you know

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,710
sometimes you have a project and it's

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,270
sort of trying to solve everything all

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,860
at once but this is a really focused

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,180
problem and therefore you can have a

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,920
really focused solution that really

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,260
solves it really well so in this project

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,809
and creator made a music teaching

20
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,940
machine that solves a problem that's

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,170
pretty common right like how do you

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,910
explain to someone how to play a music

23
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,369
instrument other than just by random

24
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,290
trial and error making sounds with the

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,360
instrument this would give the student

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,790
instant feedback of how their but what

27
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,310
note they're playing and have one

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,189
display that reminds the kids that the

29
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,710
note the bear plant is the same one the

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,299
teacher is playing or if they're

31
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,439
different less than see what the

32
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,159
difference is and I like I like this

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,159
sort of almost prosthetic synesthesia or

34
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,619
you can have these devices that you know

35
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,210
give you these extra connections between

36
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,909
senses so if you maybe would have quite

37
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,500
have made that leap on your own or you

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,180
can see that via the the kind of

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,040
technological prop then that can help

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,290
you reach additional leaves that maybe

41
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,130
you would make after that

42
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,820
I'm Adam Moya from Hungary and in this

43
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,229
video I'm going to present you my new

44
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,030
invention the federal food for

45
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,189
differential teaser it's enzo salvi dt

46
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:56,810
stands for linear variable differential

47
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,380
transformer the LVDT has free cows to

48
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,600
secondary hang on primary and the

49
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,880
primary coil is usually excited with an

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,310
alternating current so depending on the

51
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,019
move and I of course position different

52
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:10,549
voltages I being induced in the

53
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:12,830
secondary coil is you would probably

54
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,810
heard about much better fluidity it's

55
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,019
basically function like liquid metal so

56
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:20,569
if we change an LPD design code to a

57
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,420
self hole filled with furtively if we

58
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,790
tilt would accelerate the sensor the

59
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,220
amount of ferrofluid in a secondary coil

60
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,709
is changing it's really nice to see

61
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,690
people developing brand new sensor

62
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,579
technology in fact I don't think of all

63
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:37,519
the contest entries that I just I don't

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,110
think I actually saw another sort of

65
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,420
basic fundamental sensor tech like this

66
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,190
before which made it pretty unique in

67
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,049
addition to its actual design and so

68
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:47,420
this is a linear variable differential

69
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,700
transformer that uses a liquid as its

70
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,769
core instead of a piece of iron or

71
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,060
something like that it's really quite an

72
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,430
ingenious idea it's it's simple and it's

73
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,950
very effective in what it does I thought

74
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,329
that was so cool um for one thing

75
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:05,389
ferrofluids are awesome but pretty

76
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:07,579
useless for the most part I mean it's

77
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:11,590
goofy and messy and gross right I and

78
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,150
hard to work with and he's actually

79
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,859
using it for something um useful which

80
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:21,620
is really cool I liked watching the

81
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,130
progress of the project that it you know

82
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,630
they talked about why they were starting

83
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,060
it and they went all the way through

84
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,079
publishing the abstract for the paper

85
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,209
that they have under review so I really

86
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,840
enjoyed that

87
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,480
this is tito it doesn't look like much

88
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,630
but when it links up with the rest of it

89
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,350
pulse things get a little bit more

90
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,110
interesting so I initially thought this

91
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,290
is a robot that you can snap snap the

92
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,790
blogs together and out of a people

93
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,070
little snake but what I saw was it had

94
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,200
all kinds of other potential locomotion

95
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,760
methods that I hadn't even thought of

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,330
crossing little fridge for example or

97
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,400
turning from a snake into a wheel and

98
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,640
these are really neat trying to figure

99
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,590
out ways to get to places the robots

100
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,410
otherwise can't I really thought I could

101
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,540
also follow along the set of build

102
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,130
surgeons and easily build one of these

103
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,410
things i can imagine going to meet up

104
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,030
with mine and meeting up with people who

105
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,470
have 20 others we connect them together

106
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,930
and make super robots and the thing

107
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,880
about ditto that's so cool is number one

108
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,620
it's like not a multi-million dollar

109
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,040
research lab that did it and to like

110
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,930
just all of it it's clear that they just

111
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,000
run that robot all the time you know

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,220
like the number of different things that

113
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,200
those modules are doing in the videos

114
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,510
like they have sliding down inclines

115
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,140
climbing up stairs like detaching and

116
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,850
reattaching or like figuring out how

117
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,970
they can go up or down and in our

118
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,680
research group when people make the

119
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,540
robots it's like they're really excited

120
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,040
when it works once and they make a video

121
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,330
of it and they're write a paper about it

122
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,910
kind of overkill and and this ditto

123
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,470
robot seems like they're just kind of

124
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,790
like goofing off and trying to figure

125
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,160
out and learn how to do different things

126
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,220
with the robot

127
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,280
you
