1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:03,419
Hey so I'm Alex Williams and for the

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,520
last decade or so I've grown up with the

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,830
open hardware movement like lots of

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,170
people here I saw self younger with Lego

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,170
building stuff and I realized that stage

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,420
that I loved designing and building

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,220
stuff and less so the actual playing

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,310
with it there multiple times much my

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,990
parents dismay where I'd build a

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,090
brand-new model just Chuck all the parts

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,390
in a box and then build more stuff and

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,429
the open hardware movement has allowed

13
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,289
me to transition from building with Lego

14
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,510
to building cool stuff so the things

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,969
with the open-source movement there's

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,629
really empowered me it's allowed me to

17
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,239
build stuff so when people release files

18
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,180
you can build it you can derive

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,730
materials from it and then you can put

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,670
back into the community so the other

21
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,280
thing is the community aspect of it so

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,750
with the hacker community or the

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,420
instructables you can ask for help and

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,899
they provide it so when I was developing

25
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,430
the underwater glider there were lots of

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,369
people who were providing feedback and

27
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,080
suggestions for me to build upon it

28
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,810
so my first transition into open

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,970
hardware was with the MakerBot cupcake

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,240
so I realized Todd there nodding I

31
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,890
realized that in order to do stuff I

32
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,680
needed some way of manufacturing it so I

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,950
kindly asked my parents do you reckon I

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,070
can have this and I pleasantly surprised

35
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,400
when I received a make what cupcake so

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,750
spent a couple of weeks building

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,500
calibrating testing it worked and then

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,000
it was an interesting experience

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,649
building upon it and making it work

40
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,630
slightly more but it was a really

41
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,970
fundamental stage where I realized hey

42
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,180
you can get a kit and instructions and

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,470
documentation and put it all together

44
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,930
and produce something that does cool

45
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,899
stuff so in order to build stuff you

46
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,939
both need to fabricate it which is what

47
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,340
had been covered by the cupcake and then

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,619
subsequent printers what you're saying

49
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,230
is design it so from a young age I had

50
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,160
done

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,490
CGI with photorealistic rendering and

52
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,710
stuff with blender which is an

53
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,420
open-source modeling package and then as

54
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,010
I transitioned to doing more macaco

55
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,200
software more mechanical designs I

56
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,170
realized that blender wasn't quite

57
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,230
sufficient for that aspect of things

58
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,800
looking in the some people disagreeing

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,470
looking at the open source areas for

60
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,959
that there was not that much of a push

61
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,450
at that time there was open s cat but

62
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,610
the younger me didn't like programming

63
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,820
that much so the school kindly provided

64
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,680
me with a SolidWorks license which let

65
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,620
me do some more modeling there is a

66
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,570
video which meant slowed in May at some

67
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,940
point or may not so at this point I I

68
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,030
went into drones a bit so this was back

69
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,510
in 2009 or so when 3d our 3d robotics

70
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,130
were releasing control boards for their

71
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,940
drones and the blog posts outlining how

72
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,709
to build your drone I thought oh cool

73
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,560
stuff let's build it so I took the

74
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,480
control boards and the software and

75
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,459
attempts to bundle it together like they

76
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,519
had and there was a strong learning

77
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,510
curve so it was an early day for

78
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,970
documentation so this was when people

79
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,030
were really pushing the hardware at that

80
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,250
time which was limits to app milk and my

81
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,380
controllers and then they were

82
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,630
constantly at the cutting edge trying to

83
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,310
do stuff with it and the documentation

84
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,100
was lightening a bit so a couple of

85
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,190
years passed and now I revisit revisited

86
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,880
it and the documentation the hardware

87
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,590
had grown immensely so with the flight

88
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,450
controllers being open-source lots of

89
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,450
people were able to take them and do

90
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,920
subsequent versions which were much more

91
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,739
capable which led me to doing a

92
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,269
tricopter as opposed to quadcopter

93
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,899
because why do the same thing twice so I

94
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,899
then designed a frame for it which was

95
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,110
lace cut on a low-cost lace color so

96
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,570
it's again realizing that the

97
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,240
cost tools provided serve people such as

98
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,250
myself allowed manufacturing of

99
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,500
equipment like this so I had done a lot

100
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,970
of stuff in the mechanical side of

101
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,280
things and then there was some stuff

102
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,980
like software and electrical stuff that

103
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,590
I had less experience with so there was

104
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,220
a series of sessions Cambridge for

105
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,800
family makers which were for aimed at

106
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,430
children of the members of the campus to

107
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,230
engage them with mechanical software and

108
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,500
electrical aspects of engineering oh

109
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,300
it's long too a few of them and

110
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,240
thoroughly enjoyed them as I wanted to

111
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,830
run one myself because I wanted to do

112
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,990
but the thing I realized about the

113
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,220
sessions is they were all very

114
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,100
mechanical based I wanted to push a more

115
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,290
electrical side of things however I

116
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,090
realized that I had a fundamental lack

117
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,690
of experience with designing for

118
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,510
electrical so I hadn't designed a PCB so

119
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,730
I attended a series of sessions out the

120
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,330
Cambridge makerspace which taught me

121
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,090
about PCB designed to an extent so on

122
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,220
one day believe it was a day that was

123
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,400
closed by snow at school I just sat down

124
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,160
watched load of YouTube videos and learn

125
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,380
Eagle to an extent that allowed me to do

126
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,780
some stuff and then over the years learn

127
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,480
more which is allowed for the design of

128
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,840
more complex stuff so don't know if this

129
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:02,010
will know okay so I took a open source

130
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,900
design which was available so this is

131
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,720
the draw da which is done by the MIT

132
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,670
Media Lab and it's essentially a pencil

133
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,830
where you draw and you can make a

134
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,750
circuit with your finger and the other

135
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,610
end of the pencil and depending upon the

136
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,700
length of the thing it makes a different

137
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,510
tone so you can make a piano say which

138
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,170
the kids loved as you can imagine like

139
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,370
15 20 kids with a musical pencil it gets

140
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,270
been noisy but they love it

141
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,509
so then I saw it thought all this bit

142
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:41,419
cumbersome so I took the design edit it

143
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:43,160
so instead of using large batteries you

144
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,319
use smaller ones published designs so

145
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,569
others could use it so instead of just

146
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:49,310
taking from the community it still

147
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,930
attempts to put back in so why the

148
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,030
underwater glider that's from the hack

149
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,789
day price same as all the other things I

150
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:02,139
wanted to cool and do a cool thing so

151
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,669
looking around at various underwater

152
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:07,039
gliders well I was looking around for

153
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,419
various projects and it was suggested to

154
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,909
me that I do the underwater oh look at

155
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:15,199
underwater gliders and the thing with

156
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,970
them as sure was saying earlier they're

157
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,440
scientific equipment they're inherently

158
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,380
very expensive - no apparent reason so

159
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,370
that their starts at 70,000 easily goes

160
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,990
up to a quarter of a million y then

161
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,330
there are some people such as university

162
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,419
groups producing hardware for a fraction

163
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:35,990
of the cost

164
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,970
but it's inherently closed source

165
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,770
because it's just within a university

166
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,080
program so I was like this is a cool

167
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,030
intersection of electrical mechanical I

168
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,780
can do them to a degree let's mix them

169
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:54,800
in and attempt this so then and this was

170
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,360
at a point where the hack day prize was

171
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,550
starting so I thought oh okay let's

172
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,469
document this submitted to the prize and

173
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:04,759
see what happens so it's just then the

174
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,259
standard standard thing of I produced a

175
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:11,719
the initial version which got so far

176
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:16,340
didn't rework the internals moved that

177
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,810
won some money from the hackaday prize

178
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,819
which allowed me to progress and now I

179
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,469
produced a more functional prototype

180
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:24,169
which then allowed me to get a bit more

181
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,139
money to produce a third version and at

182
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,530
this point the software for it for the

183
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,299
open source front had progressed further

184
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,589
enough that I was able to transition

185
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:36,289
from SolidWorks to one shape back into a

186
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,799
open source free software not open

187
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,120
source but free and allowed people to

188
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,179
develop it for open source and that's

189
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:46,050
the wrong button

190
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,850
so then it was a similar thing on

191
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,750
electronics so it's just I breadboard it

192
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,330
with a Ord we know Lord we know is an

193
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,800
inherently low-cost thing which has

194
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,720
really enabled a lot of things on the

195
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,760
open-source Hardware front you can take

196
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,670
a breadboard and just produce a PCB with

197
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,710
it there are relatively straightforward

198
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,540
steps to doing that and that's exactly

199
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,150
what I did the information is there why

200
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,280
try and do something else and then

201
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,780
subsequently going on realizing all the

202
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,370
capability isn't quite enough in this

203
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,150
area let's do another version so trusty

204
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,050
purple PCBs so then it's kind of the

205
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,280
other side of open-source so when you

206
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,180
submit when you produce something it's

207
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,490
very easy to just do a thing yes here

208
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,920
are a couple of images of it here are

209
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,050
design files in theory you can reproduce

210
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,660
it it's very hard for people then to

211
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,420
take that thing and reproduce it without

212
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,910
the documentation over the years with

213
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,450
the MakerBot cupcake and the drones I've

214
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,310
realized that without the documentation

215
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,500
side of things it would be pretty much

216
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,200
impossible to reproduce that stuff so

217
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,230
with the hackaday prize and the glider i

218
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,180
try to document the entire thing as

219
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,010
thoroughly as possible so that people

220
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,290
can reproduce it the same way i could

221
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,310
reproduce the original stuff so then

222
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,810
it's also where that was then it's the

223
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,790
other steps so going beyond just

224
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,370
documentation so trying to make it so

225
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,590
that your designs can be produced by

226
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,990
people regardless of their hardware so

227
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,200
anyone who's dealt with printers in any

228
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,120
capacity knows that one does not

229
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,770
function the same as the next

230
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,490
so openers card is very capable of

231
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,320
making designs parametric so you can

232
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,040
customize the parts for different

233
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,290
printers and there are other ways of

234
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,660
doing this with other CAD systems which

235
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,430
is slightly more cumbersome but it is

236
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,790
taking the extra step so that things are

237
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,660
adaptable so that regardless of the

238
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,540
printer or manufacturing

239
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:08,209
it's reproducible this was quick so

240
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,910
closing thoughts so over the last decade

241
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,660
or so they were being a yeah decade

242
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,220
there's been a rather dramatic drop in

243
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,880
price of manufacturing so massive

244
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,580
amounts going into FDM printing and now

245
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,390
SLA printing and thing is price of

246
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,430
comodo manufacturing is only going to

247
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,610
decrease further which means for the

248
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,339
open source hardware movement it's just

249
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,350
going to keep on canned just going to

250
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,370
continue so as more people get to the

251
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,550
point where they can access technology

252
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,170
more of a community grows and it

253
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,330
continues further same with the same

254
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,550
with distributed manufacturing such as

255
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,430
3d hubs etc you don't require a printer

256
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,170
you just send it off to someone down the

257
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,430
street boom you have the part two days

258
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,110
then it's the fact that the open source

259
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,450
community in my experience isn't just

260
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,990
about taking people's stuff reproducing

261
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:12,270
it it's taking the design files building

262
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,920
it adapting it republishing it it's very

263
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,230
much a two-way conversation with the

264
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,709
community and then nothing happens

265
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,930
without the support / community so I

266
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,490
know for a fact that I would not be here

267
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,560
without the support of the community and

268
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,860
parents etc simply because there is no

269
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,320
way you can get into this without having

270
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,630
someone helping you along the way so

271
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,529
it's just a it's a fundamental thing in

272
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:46,290
order to progress and that had relation

273
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:50,399
no longer I believe that's it it was a

274
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,920
bit brief compared to the other one but

275
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,400
if anyone have any questions then

276
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:04,569
