1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
that's okay okay so my name is Michelle

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,710
Easter I'm a mechatronics engineer at

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,039
the Jet Propulsion lab I love my job is

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,330
fantastic I've been there for three

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,090
years so far and I'm specifically in the

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,830
payload and small spacecraft mechanical

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,990
engineering section in the mechanical

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,750
engineering division I'll talk about

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,080
that a little bit more later and more

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,699
specifically the things that I'm going

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,439
to talk about is kind of a mixed bag I

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,720
want to talk about actuators and their

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,340
role in aerospace and some of my

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,289
experience with that and then I'm going

15
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,850
to talk about dual Drive actuators

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,460
specifically which are actuators that

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,380
I'm building right now for a couple

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,629
different missions their heritage the

19
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,190
history and a little bit about the

20
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,960
harmonic drives that go inside of them

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,820
just because not everybody knows about

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,250
them and I think they're super cool and

23
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,110
then also some future JPL mechanism

24
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,629
design challenges so at JPL we tackle

25
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,160
some of the most interesting and

26
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,460
difficult and never been solved before

27
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,870
challenges and it's really rewarding to

28
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,840
work on those so just some overview and

29
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,800
then I want to talk a little bit about

30
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,239
how I entered the world of mechatronics

31
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,340
and how maybe you guys can too okay so

32
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,619
I've only been in three years at JPL but

33
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:11,790
I've worked on a lot of different

34
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,900
projects because I have an

35
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,630
interdisciplinary background and more of

36
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,720
a hands-on kind of background as well so

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,369
in the prototyping world I've worked on

38
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,799
some gravitational offloading prototypes

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,869
for a project that's called the

40
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,509
planetary landing testbed its facilities

41
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,790
that we develop at JPL in order to test

42
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,210
our flight hardware on the ground I'm

43
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,799
also right now I'm working on a project

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,360
called pin optics which is a really

45
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,869
exciting open-source Hardware project

46
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:41,850
that is doing a global search for

47
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,520
exoplanets by encouraging people to

48
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,130
build robotic telescopes using DSLR

49
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,740
cameras so asked me later about that if

50
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,119
you guys are interested a little teaser

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,560
also I've done some research and testing

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,329
kind of stuff last year I got to work on

53
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,790
the Europa Lander sampling system which

54
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,340
was really cool and also I've done some

55
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,560
characterization through cold testing of

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,990
harmonic drives for the Mars 2020

57
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,258
robotic arm and more recently I've

58
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,120
worked on some flight design and

59
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,430
development including some conceptual

60
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,470
design from our sample return which I'm

61
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,040
going to get put back on this year

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
CubeSat mission called tempest II which

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,879
was an earth observing satellite CubeSat

64
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,489
mission in central six which I'm working

65
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,709
on now and Europa clipper which I just

66
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,569
said you're working on as well they keep

67
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,950
us very busy thank you okay so I know

68
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,450
it's a mixed audience so bear with me

69
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,310
I'm gonna try to be broad with my

70
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,340
discussion so I work primarily right now

71
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,680
on building actuators and actuators are

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,629
any mechanisms that provide energy to

73
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:48,120
operate another mechanism or system so

74
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,489
the simplest example is like a motor a

75
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,830
motor is an actuator and it can operate

76
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,930
another system and they can get more

77
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,629
complicated than that

78
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:59,269
so actuators are important for a space

79
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:01,860
we need to be able to launch stuff in a

80
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,750
space it has to start small because it's

81
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,970
expensive to launch things and so we

82
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,769
have a lot of deployments this is an

83
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,319
example it's not a JPL project but I

84
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,599
think it's really cool it's a flexible

85
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,440
solar panel deployment for the ISS and

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,599
so this is a great example of how you

87
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,400
can start out with a super small volume

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,840
and then expand it to something really

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,730
big and in the case of solar panels

90
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,409
where they have a really low efficiency

91
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,629
you need a big surface area so you

92
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,370
really want to be able to make it super

93
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,560
compact and then you want to increase

94
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,959
the volume so actuators come in handy

95
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,220
for that another really cool JPL project

96
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,049
I see Allison getting excited back there

97
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,739
is starshade so I got to work a very

98
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,989
small amount just creating like a little

99
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,909
mechanical fixture for aligning some of

100
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:50,129
the petals onto this and a test phase

101
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,709
but I just love this animation it's so

102
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,540
cool starshade is a project that's going

103
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,420
to be looking for exoplanets and it

104
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,980
operates based on the principle where if

105
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,659
you block out blinding incident light

106
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,459
from a star distant away you could

107
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,439
actually see the planets orbiting around

108
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,269
it so it allow you to see more

109
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,200
exoplanets around more distant stars and

110
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,400
from a deployment standpoint you see

111
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,900
there's two stages of deployment first

112
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,700
the petals unfurl and the entire truss

113
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,130
expands radially so it's two stages of

114
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,779
deployment so it starts out really small

115
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,220
and then the overall size

116
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,930
ends up being about the size of a

117
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,840
baseball diamond so getting that into a

118
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,670
super compact form factor is really

119
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,310
challenging and actually at JPL they

120
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,440
work with origami experts in order to

121
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,930
come up with this kind of design from an

122
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,400
actuator standpoint I like it a lot

123
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,140
because you actually only need one

124
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,050
actuator for each stage of deployment so

125
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,790
two actuators can create that kind of

126
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,130
volume expansion it's really freaking

127
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,710
cool and Allisyn raise your hand back

128
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,210
there allison is a year-round intern

129
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,800
working on that project right now so if

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,910
you want to ambush her with questions

131
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,070
later I encourage that okay

132
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,080
so there's other applications for

133
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,050
actuators this is the artist concept of

134
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,370
the satellite that I'm working on right

135
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,730
now which is called Sentinel 6 another

136
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,680
intern back there was Morgan raise your

137
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,660
hand that's my internet work right now

138
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,760
feel free to ambush her later and tell

139
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,830
me how she does please so this is an

140
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,520
artist concept for the Sentinel 6 signal

141
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,560
6 satellite I mean I'm working on a

142
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,930
microwave radiometer which is indicated

143
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,850
there by the arrow and more specifically

144
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,980
I'm working on the Supplemental

145
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,660
calibration system which is a subsystem

146
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,550
on the radiometer that helps to

147
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,010
eliminate signal drift in the radiometer

148
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,229
readings and the instrument itself will

149
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:40,660
measure ocean topography levels on the

150
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,190
earth so we're looking for a changing

151
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,600
sea level rises so earth science ok so

152
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,660
this is a very old original version of

153
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,160
the actuator that I get to build right

154
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,770
now it's a heritage device it's called

155
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,930
the dual drive actuator it was

156
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,210
originally invented by Doug Packard who

157
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,630
is a freakin wizard we actually have him

158
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,280
come in about one day a week he's like

159
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,690
85 years old and he's so smart it's

160
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,120
really awesome because it's a single

161
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,190
fault tolerant redundant actuator and

162
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,410
that means that there are two

163
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,090
mechanically independent drive systems

164
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,850
within one actuator so two independent

165
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,340
systems with one common output and

166
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,570
that's really great because for

167
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,580
mission-critical deployments or emotions

168
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,070
that if we don't have those reliably the

169
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,470
entire spacecraft will be worthless

170
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,349
we want to make sure we have redundancy

171
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,390
so if one system fails the other can

172
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,030
still up

173
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,520
and so just to point out here back here

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,870
right here is where the drive

175
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,699
electronics are in case we have

176
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,560
commutation electronics that are mounted

177
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,680
to the back of the motor right here and

178
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
then this is a gearbox case and then

179
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,820
these are two sets of harmonic drives

180
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,000
and I'm gonna take a minute to talk

181
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,199
about harmonics because they're really

182
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,360
cool and I'm assuming raise your hand if

183
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,550
you've heard of harmonic drives oh this

184
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,710
is the best audience okay you guys are

185
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,750
really smart so bear with me

186
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,000
don't ask me complicated questions

187
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,820
please okay harmonic drives are really

188
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,639
awesome they're super compact low to no

189
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,970
backlash drive systems they utilize the

190
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,039
flexibility of metal to get big torque

191
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,630
out outputs in a compact form factor so

192
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,889
this is kind of an example of the way

193
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,570
they work what you have is the driving

194
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,759
input is called the wave generator it's

195
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,830
represented by this green animated part

196
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,660
right here and it's an ellipse as you

197
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,090
can see and this red piece here is

198
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,860
called a flex spline and it's a flexible

199
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,949
piece of steel that's really thin and

200
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:41,650
then the outer piece is a circular

201
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,620
spline and what you get through the

202
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,900
elliptical shape is if you'll notice you

203
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,599
get a constant really strong press at

204
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,550
the gear mesh and so that's how you get

205
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,400
your zero to no backlash and because

206
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,500
basically the teeth are pressing into

207
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,820
each other and the metal is actually

208
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,099
straining you get this added torque

209
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,270
output from the strain energy

210
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,210
contribution between the metals hence

211
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,690
the name strain weight appearing so

212
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,949
they're great and we use them for all

213
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:10,840
kinds of robotic applications and

214
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,560
industry uses them as well so these are

215
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,159
our harmonics these are my babies on the

216
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:19,960
left side you can see these are pancake

217
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,750
style harmonics they're not commonly

218
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,699
used but because we're building heritage

219
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,320
actuators that were designed in the 80s

220
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,430
we stick with what works

221
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,099
it's the NASA way we know it works so we

222
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:32,020
stay with it so this is what it looks

223
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,399
like assembled and this is actually a

224
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,049
picture right after we took them out of

225
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,729
the oven in the cleanroom from making

226
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,828
them clean and so you can see them

227
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,958
disassembled these two parts are two

228
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,690
circular splines the next went up you

229
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,400
can see little ball bearings around the

230
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,480
outside that's the wave generator and it

231
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,220
custom ball bearings that fit around the

232
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,740
outside and the top layer those are the

233
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,400
flex lines so the cool thing about

234
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,280
pancake style harmonics is the way that

235
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,000
you get the output motion is one of your

236
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,220
splines is called the static spline it's

237
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,660
actually what you hardened mountain to

238
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,010
your house and it doesn't move hence

239
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,560
static spline the other spline is called

240
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,150
the dynamic spline so it moves dynamic

241
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,980
and so basically what you have is one

242
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,050
spline you hardman into and then you

243
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,890
drive the way it generated and the flex

244
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,730
spline has a couple less teeth than the

245
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,160
static circular spline so as the wave

246
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,200
generator turns and that flex blowing

247
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,810
turns you have a relative difference in

248
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,340
motion because of the different number

249
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,710
of teeth and so while the static splines

250
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,890
stays still that an annex flying has the

251
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,690
same number of teeth as the Flex blind

252
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,490
and moves at the same rate in the

253
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,320
opposite direction because it has less

254
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,640
teeth so come bother me later if you

255
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,380
didn't catch that and I'll explain it

256
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,550
again but it's super cool and just to

257
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,230
show you the scale look how small this

258
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,790
thing is that's the Flex flying on the

259
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,700
right side and the teeth are so tiny

260
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,470
they're like paper thin and it still

261
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,970
boggles my mind that they can transmit

262
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,800
such high torques given the fact that

263
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,960
they're so small and this is actually

264
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,350
like I think it's a 10x zoom picture at

265
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,840
harmonic Drive of the inspection of the

266
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,910
final teeth of one of my Flex plans and

267
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,400
so they're like perfect it's really

268
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,470
impressive the way that they can machine

269
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,110
these parts these are some shots from me

270
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,570
fit checking all of my mechanical parts

271
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,250
came in with dimensional discrepancies

272
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,570
which was exciting in the wrong way and

273
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,730
so I spent many an hour sitting down in

274
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,680
mechanical inspection assembling things

275
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,270
by hand to make sure that all the fits

276
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,610
would be just right so this is some

277
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,770
photo and video that I took to prove to

278
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,570
my instrument manager that I was doing a

279
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,580
good job and so this is a media bin

280
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,680
assembly so I think Morgan's been there

281
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,380
for these parts so on the left side we

282
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,540
our testing the fit of the driveshaft

283
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,600
and so the beauty of the redundancy is

284
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,210
all in the mechanical interfaces which I

285
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,640
can't show you details just frustrating

286
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,660
but they're really cool you have to

287
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,600
trust me but basically one system is

288
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,510
driven by a central driveshaft and right

289
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,190
there we had just finished installing it

290
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,080
and that gear gets driven by a motor

291
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,760
that plugs into the back there it's not

292
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,250
shown yet and this is what we look like

293
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,700
when we're almost fully assembled so

294
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,230
this is a cool video to me because

295
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,970
actually you can if you look closely you

296
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,470
can see the elliptical shape of the wave

297
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,540
generator so I'm actually rotating it

298
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,170
from behind and you can kind of see that

299
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,720
it's not a circle and you can watch it

300
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,130
and you can actually see that while the

301
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,330
wave generator is moving

302
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,360
counterclockwise here this is the static

303
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,640
spline of the second system which is

304
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,410
being driven by the output of the first

305
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,810
system and it's rotating in the opposite

306
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,700
direction because of the difference in

307
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,760
number of teeth between the statics part

308
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,440
of a dynamic spline which this that

309
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,060
explained is mounted soon so this is

310
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,850
where my actuator will live on our

311
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,820
instrument that's the actuator you see

312
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,040
the two brushless motor assemblies here

313
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,570
and in that mirror right there is

314
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,390
actually what we're driving so in a

315
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,050
subsystem that my actuator is working on

316
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,550
basically we rotate this big mirror and

317
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,140
it goes back and forth between looking

318
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,210
at Earth and at cold space and then a

319
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,520
warm target and between those three

320
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,410
positions and we can tell we're always

321
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,690
looking at okay so the dual Drive has

322
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,580
been on lots of missions and we keep

323
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,140
building it because it's really reliable

324
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,470
and performs well and the first mission

325
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,300
which actually it was invented for was

326
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,140
Galileo Galileo was launched in 89 the

327
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,150
dual drive was invented before I was

328
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,050
born a little bit and Galileo was really

329
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,370
awesome because it launched the first

330
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,320
Jupiter probe it was the first to orbit

331
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,840
Jupiter and it traveled almost three

332
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,730
billion miles which is crazy

333
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,520
I lived 14 years so it's really reliable

334
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,580
and so Galileo was the reason that we

335
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,490
found out that

336
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,310
like volcanic and also that Europa is

337
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,710
oceanic so we learned a lot from Galileo

338
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,370
so this is a simple schematic of Galileo

339
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,100
and the places that the dual-drive came

340
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,160
in handy were for the high-gain antenna

341
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,260
deployment which is a mission-critical

342
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,120
function if the high-gain antenna which

343
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,560
is the one that communicates back to

344
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,750
earth doesn't deploy then we're in big

345
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,970
trouble so that's why we need redundancy

346
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,000
for deployment of something like that

347
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,350
the other one was for the nutation

348
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,810
damper and that was for basically

349
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,840
damping the deployment of the science

350
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:51,090
boom and lastly the probe relay antenna

351
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,850
so there was pointing of the actual

352
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,710
probe really antenna that communicated

353
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,870
directly with the jupiter probe to

354
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,400
communicate back to the satellite and

355
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,770
that was controlled by a joule drive as

356
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:07,920
well so I love this this is design news

357
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,890
from 1983 and they have a feature on the

358
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,230
dual drive actuator the Galileo

359
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,870
deployment and one of the things that I

360
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,340
haven't mentioned that I think is super

361
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,900
cool about this actuator is that Doug

362
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,030
Packard also invented the brushless DC

363
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,250
motor when he invented this actuator he

364
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,570
invented it for this actuator yeah

365
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,470
just like

366
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,870
and if you talk to him about this he's

367
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,340
like oh yeah I told them they could do

368
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,110
it without those brushes you know like

369
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,490
I'm like wait what yeah so it's really

370
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,530
impressive I actually have a hard copy

371
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,880
of this magazine at my desk

372
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,660
it's one of my nerd trophies amazing

373
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:55,980
invention okay so another really

374
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,890
obviously important mission from JPL was

375
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,570
Cassini which we'll hear a lot more

376
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,790
about later and there was a couple tool

377
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,200
drives that were really important on

378
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,350
Cassini as well so Cassini a couple fun

379
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,860
facts

380
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,830
I was launched in 97 so about a decade

381
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,140
later it was the first to orbit Saturn

382
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,390
and it traveled even further than

383
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,610
Cassini or I'm sorry than Galileo at

384
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,920
about five million miles of 20 years

385
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,650
which is a crazy lifespan longer than

386
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,910
some of the people in this room I'm sure

387
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,900
are old and it was massive it was 12,000

388
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,860
pounds satellite which is crazy huge so

389
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,840
this is a schematic of the different

390
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,600
subsystems of Cassini and the places

391
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,430
where dual drives lived we're right here

392
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,680
which was the main engine assembly cover

393
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,800
and for that when they were working on

394
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,600
Cassini they got knee-deep into the bill

395
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,860
then they realized that they were gonna

396
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,550
have problems with micro meteorites

397
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,620
basically bombarding the thrusters and

398
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,840
potentially damaging it so they

399
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,790
developed these deployable covers that

400
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,500
would cover the main engine assembly

401
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,840
when needed and then move out of the way

402
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,190
when it was time to fire the thrusters

403
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,290
and so this was another mission-critical

404
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,470
motion that required redundancy hence

405
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,370
the dual drive the other subsystem was

406
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,290
the articulated reaction wheel mechanism

407
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,870
and reaction wheels are used for

408
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,570
pointing for spacecraft and so if we

409
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,010
wanted to steer this sucker we better

410
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,840
rely on it being able to do what we want

411
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,250
it to do hence another dual Drive so

412
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,950
this is actually a picture of the larger

413
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,890
version of the heritage dual drive so

414
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,120
the first one that I showed you guys

415
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,270
before was a size 14 this is the size 20

416
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,500
it's bigger and

417
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,450
a higher torque rating and there's

418
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,250
actually a clutch on the output and this

419
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,070
was the actual model that was used to

420
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,200
drive the main engine assembly covers

421
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,950
and this is also the model that I get to

422
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,550
build for clipper super stick without

423
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,230
the clutch other implementations for the

424
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,820
dual Drive have been for several shuttle

425
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,830
missions because since shuttle missions

426
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,870
involve human spaceflight they require

427
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,770
triple redundancy and so this amazing

428
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,720
genius wizard woman Laurie Sheree she

429
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
who works with us at JPL actually

430
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,670
delivered a try drive which was a dual

431
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,949
Drive driven by a dual drive wheel drive

432
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:19,260
inception for the shuttle mission so

433
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,089
that they could have dual redundancy

434
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,550
okay so there's a lot of really awesome

435
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,800
future mechanisms that we get to work on

436
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,460
at JPL so when I mentioned earlier is

437
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,800
Europa clipper so I'm delivering that

438
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,810
larger dual drive that I showed you guys

439
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,090
just a minute ago for the deployment of

440
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,750
the ice mag beam the ice mag is a really

441
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,520
awesome magnetometer instrument that's

442
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,650
going on clipper clippered clipper is

443
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,840
going to orbit Jupiter and specifically

444
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,810
focus on studying Europa and in case you

445
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,110
guys don't know we have tons of evidence

446
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,490
convincing us that there are saltwater

447
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,680
oceans under the thick icy shell of

448
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,870
Europa and so we have a lot of optimism

449
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,760
that they could potentially host life

450
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,630
since it's warm in salt water so ice mag

451
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,370
will be determining the ocean depths

452
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,020
salinity and also the ice shell

453
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,490
thickness around the outer layer of

454
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,040
Europa and also be able to identify

455
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,740
plume activity in Europa okay so this is

456
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,260
super different route but I'm equally

457
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,480
excited about it so I've gotten to do

458
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,790
some conceptual development for the Mars

459
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,250
sample return missions Mars sample

460
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,230
return is a really awesome series of

461
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,260
missions that JPL is working on so I'm

462
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,970
sure you guys have heard of curiosity

463
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,390
the rover so we're working on building

464
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,020
another Rover

465
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,630
it's called Mars 2020 and so that's

466
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,850
represented kind of here and basically

467
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,040
the concept for Mars sample return is

468
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,070
the Mars 2020 launches lands on Mars it

469
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,090
has a really Road

470
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,370
sampling system that packages samples

471
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,370
and deposits them across the surface of

472
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,610
Mars a future mission that we're working

473
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,649
on is going to be a fetching Rover and

474
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:03,240
it's going to be in charge of fetching

475
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,529
these samples that have been deposited

476
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:08,480
and packaging them up into an orbiting

477
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,679
sample capsule

478
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,929
we call it the of the acronyms keep

479
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:14,279
popping into my head I'm trying to push

480
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,629
them out so the fetching rover then goes

481
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:20,370
to another future mission which is

482
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,399
called the MAV the Mars ascent vehicle

483
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:24,869
Mars ascent vehicle is in charge of

484
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:26,789
taking these package samples and then

485
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:29,460
launching them into Martian orbit so now

486
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,590
imagine you have this capsule that's

487
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,570
filled with these samples of Mars rocks

488
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,059
and it's orbiting around Mars then the

489
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,639
next mission is the Mars rocks our OCS

490
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:41,759
which I need to learn that acronym but

491
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,399
basically it's an instrument on a Mars

492
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:46,679
orbiting satellite that is then in

493
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,809
charge of intercepting that sample pod

494
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:51,899
in orbit capturing it doing a process

495
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,879
that's called breaking the chain so

496
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:56,159
giving us a less than one in a million

497
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:58,679
chance of any potential contact between

498
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,009
any Martian particle and earth breaking

499
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:04,470
the chain and then taking that capsule

500
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,389
and launching it back to earth and

501
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:08,850
crash-landing in the Utah desert so that

502
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,700
we can retrieve it and study the samples

503
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,190
here on earth with a much larger set of

504
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,779
scientific facilities that we have here

505
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:20,129
so this is a really exciting set of

506
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:21,570
missions that's going to take us through

507
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,059
the next couple of decades at JPL and as

508
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,919
soon as I finish delivering my son well

509
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,360
six dual drives I get to work on

510
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,639
mechanisms for rocks so I'm like trying

511
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:34,200
to hurry up and deliver this another set

512
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,490
of really awesome mechanisms is coming

513
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,009
up for the Europa Lander development so

514
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:43,950
Europa Lander is a really crazy amazing

515
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,659
challenge there's huge thermal and

516
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:48,179
radiation challenges with Europa it's

517
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,799
really far away from the Sun so it's

518
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,480
super cold there's no atmosphere and

519
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,059
there's tons of radiation and for a

520
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,190
potential landowner we have to design

521
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,169
mechanisms that can deal with the fact

522
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:00,000
that there's really small amounts of

523
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,690
gravity barely any atmosphere to help

524
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,490
use our speed when we try to land and

525
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,909
approach Europa potential high magnetic

526
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:11,730
fields also unknown terrain the closest

527
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,980
up image that we have of the Europa and

528
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,559
surface is like kilometers or something

529
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,299
I think don't quote me on that but we

530
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,590
don't have any kind of surface level

531
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,139
details so landing on this surface is a

532
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:24,659
really big challenge in and of itself so

533
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,210
there's a whole landing mechanism team

534
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,340
that's working on super cold temperature

535
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,740
landing mechanisms for variable

536
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,950
topography and chemical compositions big

537
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,320
challenge and then the sampling system

538
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,789
which I got to work on a little bit last

539
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:40,590
year has a whole other set of challenges

540
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,289
because you need to sample into any

541
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:45,779
surface that's cryogenically frozen that

542
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:47,879
could be sulfuric acid and it might be

543
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:50,039
like giant sulfuric acid ice daggers and

544
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,629
you're trying to sample into it while

545
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:53,759
not changing its temperature so as to

546
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,389
not disturb it so we have a lot of

547
00:21:57,389 --> 00:22:00,960
really cool mechatronic research and

548
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,860
flight applications that are coming up

549
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,389
so this is actually I just throw this in

550
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:08,279
there because I had to this is a chamber

551
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,840
that I helped get on lab for testing for

552
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,879
Europa Lander sampling system last year

553
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:14,820
right before we had a little shelving

554
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,100
incident because of the budget so one

555
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,629
day it'll see its day and have some

556
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,889
awesome hardware and they're testing

557
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:24,330
with it okay so that's me

558
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,139
obviously so just the switch gears um I

559
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,669
want to close by talking a little bit

560
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:30,779
about how I actually got into

561
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:33,990
mechatronics I haven't always been along

562
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,289
the direct path to be an engineer and so

563
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,269
I'm hoping that if anybody in here is

564
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:40,649
not an engineer that they might be

565
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:44,279
inspired to try so I actually grew up on

566
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,740
a farm in a really small town we didn't

567
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,600
have a physics teacher and I didn't know

568
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,360
what an engineer was I never heard of it

569
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,639
and I like building things because I

570
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,350
grew up on a farm but I didn't really

571
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,970
have the educational background or any

572
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,830
kind of role models or anything to look

573
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,830
up to and also after I graduated high

574
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,889
school I actually got into fashion I

575
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:06,480
spent several years after I graduated

576
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,580
working as a fashion model which was

577
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,960
really fun because I like shoes a lot

578
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,910
and I like traveling and I like people

579
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,640
like working in teams I like creative

580
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,940
people which is why I like engineering a

581
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,240
lot I just didn't know at the time so

582
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,010
after several years of working as a

583
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,930
model I finally kind of came to realize

584
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,390
that I was a little bit intellectually

585
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,850
under simulated and I was actually a

586
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,490
nerd which I truly am and I decided to

587
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,670
try to go back to college so that was

588
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,290
really hard because I was like an adult

589
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,120
at the time and I had no background I

590
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,530
didn't even know how to go to college or

591
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,400
whatever so I just did my best and

592
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,780
basically my approach that I took was

593
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,190
I'm just gonna do my best and I'm gonna

594
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,710
build stuff and eventually I'll get

595
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,560
there and so these were a couple of the

596
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,660
first projects that got me a lot of

597
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,850
momentum that allowed me to enter a

598
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,950
world like JP oh that's my dog one of

599
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,630
the first projects that told me that hey

600
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,130
I could actually maybe be a good

601
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,630
engineer was when I built a dog house

602
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,950
for my dog I did woodworking and my dad

603
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,930
had a sawmill and so that felt kind of

604
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,210
natural and I just measured my dog and I

605
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,210
like to sketched it out I want to you

606
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,530
know make a house that looks like you

607
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,110
know him with a crown he'll stand in the

608
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,790
doorway and I envisioned this whole

609
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,890
thing and I had a lot of fun out there

610
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,480
like cutting up wood and making my thing

611
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,030
and when I got to the roof I decided you

612
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,620
know I'm living in New York it's so hot

613
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,690
it's the summer it's humid I need to

614
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,930
give him ventilation and so I started

615
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,070
like kind of poking around on the

616
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,540
internet and I wasn't used to Google

617
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,370
because I was like pre Google era from

618
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,350
high school but I was like just trying

619
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,450
to see what's out there and I found a

620
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,760
bay and I found that on eBay you can buy

621
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,520
like lots of chipped solar cells and

622
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,410
they have reduced efficiency but that's

623
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,880
okay because actually there's an

624
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,070
equation that can tell you the surface

625
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,450
area that you need given a reduce

626
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,980
efficiency of a solar cell and the power

627
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,660
requirements of this little fan that I

628
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,910
found that I wanted to use and said and

629
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,560
so I'm like poking around and all of a

630
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,050
sudden one day it dawned on me like what

631
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,050
am i doing nobody's helping me and I'm

632
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,610
having fun and this is like really

633
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,320
awesome but I bet you if I got like an

634
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,870
actual education I could probably build

635
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,590
some cool stuff maybe I don't know right

636
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,660
so I tried it

637
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,540
and I enrolled in college I fought super

638
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,580
hard I had to retake my SATs at the age

639
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,770
of 27 to compete with all those super

640
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,230
nerd eighteen-year-old kids which was

641
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,140
awkward but I did it and I finally got

642
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,790
accepted to transfer into an engineering

643
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,100
school and once I got into engineering

644
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,960
school then I was full steam ahead I

645
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,000
ended up getting an internship

646
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,090
opportunity at Princeton University

647
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,830
doing physics which is cool but I wanted

648
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,280
to build stuff so I convinced my physics

649
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,480
professor that I was working for to let

650
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,520
me build the mechatronics system that

651
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,840
would partially automate his laser

652
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,740
experiment and he let me do it yes it

653
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,890
was awesome and that was basically me

654
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,960
teaching myself how to build a

655
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,640
mechatronics system to partially

656
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,400
automated laser experiment I had just

657
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,230
gotten the building blocks of computer

658
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,850
science just enough to teach myself

659
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,070
enough with MATLAB to do image

660
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,320
processing to be able to identify laser

661
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,390
and track it right it's just a community

662
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:25,800
array and I just got enough CAD

663
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,930
experience and design mechanisms and

664
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,850
build the system that I needed to model

665
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,510
in CAD and it was a great learning

666
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,640
experience and the biggest thing that I

667
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,230
learned from that experience is that I

668
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,970
know that if I don't know something I

669
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,460
can always learn it and I built a lot of

670
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,010
confidence in that and so that system

671
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,360
actually is what attracted the attention

672
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,910
of JPL which led to them hiring me

673
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,950
before my senior year in college which

674
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:55,110
was unbelievable so now I get to build

675
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,730
awesome stuff all the time that's me and

676
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,280
a lot of buried in parts and I highly

677
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,990
encourage anybody who's interested in

678
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,320
mechanisms or curious or anything to

679
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,790
teach yourself there's tons of resources

680
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,750
out there and you'll blow yourself away

681
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,800
with what you're capable of so anybody

682
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,180
has any questions please I'll be happy

683
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,920
to answer you

684
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,670
