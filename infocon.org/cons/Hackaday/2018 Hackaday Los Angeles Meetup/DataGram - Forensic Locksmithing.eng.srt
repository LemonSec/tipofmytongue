1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
hi s Jasmine said I'm data tonight we're

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,790
gonna be learning about lock-picking

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,859
forensics it's okay

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,990
there's no electrons involved in what

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,160
you're gonna learn tonight it's okay

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,090
you'll be all right

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,470
I promise no LEDs unfortunately but I

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,400
think together we'll get through it

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,500
so everybody always wants me to put this

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,000
slide in I usually delete it

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,750
but after many requests I put it back in

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,460
about me data I'm a covert entry

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,830
specialist one of the parts of that is

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,000
that I specialize in forensic

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,739
locksmithing which we'll learn about

16
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,050
tonight aside from that I do a lot of

17
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,480
security research and a lot of digital

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,010
security as well so not just physical

19
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,320
stuff as Jasmine said I run layer one

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,430
I'm one of the founders of null-space

21
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,940
labs here in LA asked me more about

22
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,149
myself after I suppose what are we gonna

23
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,280
learn about today so I know show of

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,930
hands how many of you know how a lock

25
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,640
works and how to pick it

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,690
I like how at the first part you guys

27
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,129
did not raise your hand and then I said

28
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,539
how to pick it and then suddenly

29
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,020
three-fourths of the crowd now that's a

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,850
little concerning but it's okay we got

31
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,299
you covered

32
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,490
we're gonna about learn about basic pin

33
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,049
tumbler locks which is like the the

34
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,610
standard lock ninety percent of the

35
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,470
world uses we're gonna learn about lock

36
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,990
picking the first two items we're gonna

37
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,750
try and get through in about 90 seconds

38
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,490
to 120 seconds because we have other

39
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,530
stuff to actually talk about so sorry if

40
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,930
you're new and then we're gonna talk

41
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,150
about forensics and some other methods

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,829
of entry questions are okay feel free to

43
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,229
interrupt me at any time the only game I

44
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,579
don't want to play is the what-if game

45
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,920
so being forensics all of you being

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,170
intelligent curious creative thinking

47
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,420
people you have a tendency to go well

48
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,670
what if I 3d print something and then

49
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,110
shrink wrap it and then put foil on it

50
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,610
and does that leave forensic marks

51
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,720
that's the only game I don't want to

52
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,689
play tonight at least during the talk

53
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:53,159
because we get into this problem of

54
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,960
infinite possibilities and infinite

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,979
answers so before we get into that let's

56
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,390
talk about what is forensic locksmithing

57
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,060
so it's this idea that by examining

58
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,750
locks keys access control devices you

59
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,699
can find evidence of things other than

60
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,280
normal use so four key based things this

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,319
would be use of a key is the only thing

62
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,519
is considered normal use right who does

63
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,170
this so insurance companies do this

64
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,030
governments do this law enforcement does

65
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,069
this it's really only at a high level

66
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,040
right so if your doors kicked in you're

67
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,810
not gonna need a forensic locksmith to

68
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,620
know what happened right hey typically

69
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,840
there was a very high-profile case about

70
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
ten years ago of a burglar who did pick

71
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,500
locks and then kick the door in after

72
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,969
the fact

73
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:40,230
in Europe and that was actually very

74
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,760
interesting but other than that other

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,439
than the one person in 6,000,000,000

76
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,290
doing this you you probably will not

77
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,060
have need of a forensic locksmith during

78
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,859
your life but for very high profile

79
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:52,349
again government military type things it

80
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:56,370
does come up so let's talk about how

81
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,840
locks work so this is what's called a

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,760
pin tumbler lock again ninety percent of

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,879
the world uses this lock the outer piece

84
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,069
here called the cylinder inner piece

85
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,689
called the plug easy way to remember

86
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,069
this is that there's a hole in the

87
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,030
cylinder plugged by the plug obviously

88
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,919
you all have used a key at some point in

89
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,949
your life you all I assume have some

90
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:18,689
kind of property or something that you

91
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:21,930
secure via a key so hopefully you've met

92
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,329
a lock and a key before this one's

93
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,069
pretty easy keyhole everybody familiar

94
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,629
with that the pattern of cuts on the

95
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,549
keyhole is what differentiates you no

96
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:31,799
lock brand a is key for going to lock

97
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,150
brands B lock inside there's a series of

98
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,919
chambers a typical lock has five

99
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,199
sometimes four sometimes six sometimes

100
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,629
seven chambers inside each of the

101
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:44,909
chambers is a set of pins and a spring

102
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:46,680
and the spring pushes it down to its

103
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,519
default position in other parts of the

104
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,409
world for example the Netherlands they

105
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:54,389
don't mount the locks the same way we do

106
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,340
in the US so this is the typical kind of

107
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,079
North American configuration right we

108
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,030
have the keyhole at the bottom the pins

109
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,370
going up and the spring goes with

110
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,439
gravity other parts of the world they

111
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,120
rotate this it doesn't have an impact on

112
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,639
the lock functionally and some people

113
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,199
think well don't I need gravity no

114
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,030
that's the point of the spring is to

115
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,579
push everything to its default position

116
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:16,168
the easy way to remember what's what is

117
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:17,820
that the red pin is called the key pin

118
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,649
because it physically comes in contact

119
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,560
with the key the blue pin is called the

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,779
driver pin because it drives the key pin

121
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,380
down via the force of the spring

122
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,700
and you go to school so there's probably

123
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,550
a lot of these terms that are wrong

124
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,520
however I am an expert so without a key

125
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,050
without a key there was no forensic

126
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,550
locksmithing school at the time if that

127
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,340
makes sense without a key the animations

128
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,960
don't work apparently oh that's weird

129
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,720
why don't they work that's going to be

130
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,280
awful awkward if none of them work

131
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,200
that's weird

132
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,340
all right now we are in need of

133
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,490
technical help from the hackers here why

134
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:21,289
wouldn't it work see it works there but

135
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:26,919
it doesn't work there that's interesting

136
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,039
okay

137
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:29,719
yes we're watching it like this because

138
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:35,719
technology hmm isn't that curious anywho

139
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:40,129
so what without a key if this one wants

140
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:43,129
to work the idea is that the blue pin by

141
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:45,409
default the driver pin blocks rotation

142
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,180
of the plug and on the back of the lock

143
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,650
is something that connects to the actual

144
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,379
bolt work so the shackle the latch the

145
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:52,729
deadbolt depending on the type of lock

146
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,370
right so physically prevents you from

147
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,039
rotating right now the purpose of the

148
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,810
key is that the key each of the cuts on

149
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,069
the key correspond to pulling the

150
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:05,810
Chamber's in the lock and it raises that

151
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,379
set of pins to the point where the key

152
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:11,180
pin and the driver pin meet at the point

153
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,860
where the cylinder and the plug meet

154
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,259
does that make sense simple mechanical

155
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:19,520
idea now in a typical lock there's again

156
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,889
five pin stacks something like this some

157
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,150
of the other things you'll know is that

158
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,440
there's some lips and other things

159
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,000
around it so that you can't just shove a

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,169
shim in there and figure out where

161
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:30,469
everything's supposed to go the purpose

162
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:32,690
of the key is to come in here and again

163
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,400
different cuts on the key correspond to

164
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,039
different sizes of the key pin all of

165
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,599
this is stopped by the shoulder of the

166
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,339
key which is this square protrusion here

167
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:42,529
that tells it to register against the

168
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:43,969
face of the lock so that all the cuts on

169
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,729
the key or in the correct position

170
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:48,139
relative to all the components in the

171
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:50,569
lock and if everything's at the right

172
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,250
height then the lock can the plug can

173
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,620
rotate interface with the bolt mechanism

174
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,569
now there's two kind of failure modes

175
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,300
right so in any of the chambers one of

176
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,699
the pin sets can be too low causing the

177
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,240
driver pin to block or a key pin can be

178
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,110
too high

179
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,029
causing the key pin to now block you

180
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,440
from rotating so all of these have to be

181
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,969
in the right position it's not a matter

182
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:12,199
of just shoving something in the lock

183
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,180
and raising it up because those would be

184
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,899
bad locks and we don't want that right

185
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:20,209
so in in like a very logical way when

186
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,110
you look at a lock

187
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,090
you might think the way this works is

188
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,880
that this is the top view of the plug so

189
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,620
these are all the chamber holes all the

190
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,630
pins in Springs sit in when you turn the

191
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,570
plug maybe with the wrong key or with a

192
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,160
screwdriver or something it's very

193
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,020
logical to assume that all of these are

194
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,580
checked for being in the right position

195
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,070
at the same time but that's not true so

196
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,530
the real world is very poorly made

197
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,150
Chinese locks and even the most

198
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,700
perfectly made expensive infinite money

199
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,920
lock would wear down over time and start

200
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,350
displaying tolerance so when you machine

201
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,450
something as many of you know here at

202
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,790
the hackaday lab you have to specify a

203
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,130
tolerance with which all the things are

204
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,020
aligned and sized and so on

205
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,530
the same is true of a lock so

206
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,090
realistically all of the chambers are a

207
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,660
little bit off

208
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,510
symmetrically they're different sizes

209
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,950
the pins themselves can be bigger

210
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,890
smaller more oval than round and so on

211
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,410
and so on so what ends up happening is

212
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,690
that when the lock is turned it's not 5

213
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,880
pins being checked at once it's one pin

214
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,700
checked at a time in series based on all

215
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,160
these small mechanical tolerance

216
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,580
imperfections right so to help enhance

217
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,850
this idea imagine the gray square here

218
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,350
is the wall of the cylinder coming to

219
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,580
check if everything's in the right spot

220
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,760
so in our very zoomed in view one of

221
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,130
these is more to the left for example so

222
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,929
that's checked and if that's in the

223
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,460
right position then it can continue on

224
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,680
and check the next and the next and so

225
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,930
on and the keys job is to make sure that

226
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,490
all the pins are at the right height and

227
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,190
it feels to you very seamless when you

228
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,170
just turn it and it works right this

229
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,330
makes sense so far all right that's how

230
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,310
locks work that's all you need to know

231
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,760
about locks as far as lock picking lock

232
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,890
picking is this idea of applying torque

233
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,320
which causes the act of binding this is

234
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,300
the the lock checking if each of the

235
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,270
pins is in the right position and then a

236
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,100
manipulation tool typically called a

237
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,710
pick comes in and you check to feel

238
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,780
which of these is binding based on the

239
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,360
pressure and feel of how springy it is

240
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,340
so when it's being checked the two walls

241
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,140
of the plug and cylinder are biting

242
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,090
against it causing friction and a

243
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,250
different feel to the person doing the

244
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,530
manipulation and then from there you

245
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,850
develop a mental map in your head of

246
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,140
what you have put in the right place

247
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,670
what you haven't

248
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,050
and so on and so on and you work your

249
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,130
way through the lock methodically or you

250
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,420
do what most of you probably learned

251
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,040
which is this idea of raking where you

252
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,300
just shove something in the lock very

253
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,490
rapidly and it's time to brute force it

254
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,170
makes sense everybody know how to pick

255
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,310
locks now good so as far as forensic

256
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,900
locksmithing what we're trying to do is

257
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,970
number one determine the method of entry

258
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,920
used open a lock so obviously it's not

259
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,660
just lock picking is not the only way to

260
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,800
open a lock there's many variations

261
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,380
we'll talk about a couple of them we

262
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,090
want to identify any tools or techniques

263
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,610
used potentially time requirements to

264
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,850
help paint a portrait for investigators

265
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,520
any skill requirements any like literal

266
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,610
gear requirements and any evidence so

267
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,040
there's very small trace evidence of an

268
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,650
often left behind keys specifically or

269
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,000
something that you handle you put your

270
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,850
pocket which has a lot of things tying

271
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,740
you to places right in terms of trace

272
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,120
evidence hair fiber blood so on right

273
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,760
aside from that it's just preparation of

274
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,380
an investigative report potentially

275
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,230
expert testimony in court as many of you

276
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,430
even though you guys are like super

277
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,170
intelligent technically minded people

278
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,820
many of you coming into this may not

279
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,410
know how a lock works and the same is

280
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,680
true of a jury may need explanation of

281
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,290
such evidence and why this is the way it

282
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,580
is and possibilities and so on so in

283
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,050
terms of like how this is categorized

284
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,400
there's three methods of entry

285
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,200
destructive I think fairly easy to

286
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,270
understand destructive very obvious that

287
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,940
it was manipulated open or damaged in

288
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,300
some way

289
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,940
covert refers to something that the user

290
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,190
cannot see but a forensic inspection

291
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,590
will will typically uncover then there's

292
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,630
surreptitious which is a method of entry

293
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,000
where it's very difficult or impossible

294
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,930
to tell that it happened so the very the

295
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,030
the simplest example of this is somebody

296
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,490
looking at you wearing your keys on your

297
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,350
belt which sorry if you are after this

298
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,290
talk but people can look at your keys

299
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,240
see what the pattern of cuts is make a

300
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,700
duplicate key with that pattern of cuts

301
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,290
then use it it's very difficult to

302
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,940
determine that that happened outside

303
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,540
them some some very specific edge cases

304
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,160
and then there's also like this idea of

305
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,840
real life versus forensics

306
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,450
as far as my job I'm not doing blood

307
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,340
analysis I'm not doing the ballistics

308
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,080
wires or anything else right I'm only

309
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,690
focused on locks and keys and things

310
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,700
that assist somebody else in figuring

311
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,570
this out right

312
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,290
I'm not Columbo despite my looking like

313
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,130
Columbo and then again there's also this

314
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,230
like CSI vs. forensic locksmithing thing

315
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,000
where people assume like the most

316
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,070
complicated expensive forensics tests

317
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,390
are done but if the the case is for a

318
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,800
$5,000 theft or something like this

319
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,110
right they're not going to spend $80,000

320
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,790
on a very complicated scientific

321
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,550
forensic test right so just kind of the

322
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,560
realities of you know life any questions

323
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,470
so far I promise it gets more

324
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,060
interesting so when I started this this

325
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,850
was roughly 2007 ish I there's no

326
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,410
published information on this I knew it

327
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,450
was a thing obviously people who did

328
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,670
this before I got interested in it but I

329
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,740
couldn't find any info so I did what

330
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,990
every hard-working hacker does and I

331
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,030
said I'm gonna buy thousands of locks

332
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,130
and do things like this so what does the

333
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,360
lock look like new under a microscope

334
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,330
this is to give myself a baseline right

335
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:03,200
for what is normal so this is what a pin

336
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,210
a key pin looks like normal you can see

337
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,800
that there's some machining marks some

338
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,390
artifacts left behind by the machining

339
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,830
on the tip of the pin closer up you

340
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,440
could see these a little bit better now

341
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,830
same is true for keys obviously and all

342
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,240
of these are made in a different way and

343
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,550
the method by which they're manufactured

344
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,350
has an effect on what they look like new

345
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,290
and so on how they wear the materials

346
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,420
make a difference every little piece

347
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,160
kind of figures in this is the face of

348
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,010
the plug to give you an idea and then I

349
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,390
did what every hard-working hacker does

350
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,430
I said I'm gonna turn the key in the

351
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,840
lock and take it in and out of the lock

352
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,600
as many times as I can stand so here's

353
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,980
what the pin looks like after a hundred

354
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,720
uses you'll see a pattern of we're

355
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,490
starting now these are brass pins if

356
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,620
you're interested versus a brass key the

357
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,320
keys are typically cast whereas the pins

358
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,930
can be either cast or part cast part

359
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,530
machined fully lathes so on and so on

360
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,150
anyways a pattern of wear appears a

361
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,410
little bit closer you can see it

362
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,910
differently under

363
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,440
kind of light source the same ring key

364
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,080
starts to wear down as well 1500 uses

365
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,030
this is pin wand so this is the pin

366
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,640
closest to the face of the lock starts

367
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,560
to wear down very dramatically right you

368
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,030
see almost all the machining marks are

369
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,580
gone pin five however is different does

370
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,650
anybody know why pin five is the one in

371
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,650
the furthest back of the lock sorry

372
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:29,630
he raised his hand your answer is

373
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,560
correct but I think it's phrased a

374
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,570
little wrong so the the answer is that

375
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,930
the key itself touches pin one with the

376
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,300
whole key in and out whereas the pin and

377
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,040
the back of the lock is just touched by

378
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,960
the tip of the key during normal

379
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,510
operation right so you could see there's

380
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,860
a couple different things so number one

381
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,330
is that obviously it's a lot less worn

382
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,970
number two is that the actual marks are

383
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,010
much more scratched like this is caused

384
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,230
by in relation to this the tip of the

385
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,750
key wears down much faster than the one

386
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,160
closer to the bow of the key the part

387
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,410
that you hold so it's more likely to be

388
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,720
jagged and Scratchy as opposed to the

389
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,550
the other thing key this is the tip of

390
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,500
the key starts to develop crevices

391
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,190
the black is lubricant or brass on brass

392
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,870
action five thousand uses yes this is

393
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,370
all done by hand I did not I was not

394
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,840
smart enough to build a robot to do this

395
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,850
at the time and also I told myself at

396
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,590
about like three thousand and it's more

397
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,240
realistic this way so pin one obviously

398
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,890
the machining marks have fully worn down

399
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,570
and you'll see a second ring of we're

400
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,480
starting so this is why a very old very

401
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,550
used lock starts to not work with the

402
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,610
key because the pieces of it start

403
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,310
physically wearing down such that the

404
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,080
alignment of everything and what the

405
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,430
keys supposed to do starts to be a

406
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,230
little bit off so this is why if you've

407
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,820
had a very old lock you need to pull the

408
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,650
key in or pull the key out or push the

409
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,390
key in a little bit to get all the

410
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,370
Heights just right because of wear like

411
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:55,790
this

412
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,480
so again pin 1 very worn down pin 5 very

413
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,520
different so there's a couple similar

414
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,890
things so again we're building a new

415
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,020
wear ring around the edge the wear on

416
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,630
this is also oval for the same reason

417
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,150
that the key doesn't go and all the way

418
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,089
in and out on pin 5 it's not getting

419
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,680
full range of rotation

420
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,540
because it's only touching a very small

421
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,670
part of the key whereas pin one rides

422
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,370
the full length of the key so

423
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,990
interesting stuff the plug now you'll be

424
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,490
shocked to learn that in all my five

425
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,930
thousand attempts so far I did not

426
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,880
always get it in the keyhole the first

427
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,839
dry so the the process for this was that

428
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,220
I would put the key all the way in I'd

429
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,160
turn it 360 I take the key out X x right

430
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,260
so in the process of going in and out

431
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,600
then I would chip it against the front

432
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,060
so you'll see stuff like this some

433
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,339
people see this which is the shoulder of

434
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,140
the thing that stops the key and aligns

435
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,140
it properly touches the face of the plug

436
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,700
like that's what it's supposed to do so

437
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,770
if any of you have heard of key bumping

438
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,690
people say oh this is evidence of key

439
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,260
bumping but without like actual knowing

440
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,250
what you're talking about or forensic

441
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,530
investigation it can be misleading to

442
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,230
say so and I have some examples later so

443
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,420
here's a closer view there's the key

444
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,339
again those ridges that we saw before

445
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,050
and now much deeper so let's talk about

446
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,939
lock picking again the lock the act of

447
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,530
lock picking in most covered entry

448
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,809
techniques is an invasive manipulation

449
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:31,220
of the lock and its components under non

450
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,130
normal scenarios so what I mean by that

451
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,050
is that when you use a key

452
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,580
you take your key you put the key all

453
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,160
the way in and then you turn and if it's

454
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
the correct key everything is already in

455
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,850
the right position right and it just

456
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,770
rotates and then you take the key out if

457
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,660
you use the wrong key it just stops you

458
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,830
right away right

459
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,990
the act of lock picking uses a secondary

460
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,230
torque source that is applied before any

461
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,660
of the components move and this is like

462
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,210
a key part of why people say well it's a

463
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,070
brass thing can't you just use a brass

464
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,340
pick or a carbon fiber pick or a

465
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,020
fiberglass pick or a 3d printed pick or

466
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,400
something like this to avoid evidence

467
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,160
but this act of being required to apply

468
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,770
torque before anything has moved kind of

469
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,559
defeats some of this so if you think

470
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,030
about the way lock picking works

471
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,980
we're leaving marks and all the places

472
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,220
where there are red marks the cam if I

473
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,690
didn't mention it is the piece on the

474
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,690
back of the lock that holds the plug to

475
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,010
the

476
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:32,360
to the cylinder and it also usually has

477
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,130
a protrusion that acts as the actuator

478
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:39,490
for the latch bolt shackle so on so a

479
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,530
lock that has been picked has a number

480
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,560
of scratches on it and it's on a number

481
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,380
of parts of the lock that the key cannot

482
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,960
do or in a way that the key cannot

483
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,720
create so again typically characterized

484
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,410
by a number of scratches in a nonlinear

485
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,140
pattern now again the pins can rotate so

486
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,780
it's hard to say specifically that it

487
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,240
was not a key however the angle in the

488
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,120
direction and the depth and so on help

489
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,830
distinguish key marks versus

490
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,330
lock-picking marks and as we saw

491
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,240
previously even on pin five where it's

492
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,950
the most scratchy and the most likely to

493
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,750
leave scratches it looks much different

494
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,260
than this right so this is just a number

495
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,050
of blocks that I took apart some of

496
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,670
these were picked once some of these

497
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,540
were picked a lot of times by beginners

498
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,370
and experts alike now you can tell some

499
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,840
interesting characteristics about the

500
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,270
lock picker typically or specifically

501
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,980
how much torque they use if they're very

502
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,100
heavy-handed on the torque may imply

503
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,660
that they are a less skilled lock picker

504
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,750
so you could see very deep marks here so

505
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,010
they're putting too much torque on the

506
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,990
lock causing the pins to get stuck when

507
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,950
they're trying to manipulate them

508
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,470
leading to bigger marks and so on okay

509
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,780
so here a little bit lighter you can

510
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,730
kind of differentiate single pin picking

511
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,440
which is what this would be where you're

512
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,290
manually probing individually parts of

513
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,380
of each of the pins versus raking where

514
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,560
you're going in and out with less force

515
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,360
per per pins on so today okay again

516
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,940
single pin picking we can also tell that

517
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,880
this is pin 5 of this lock because much

518
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,290
less wear than the other ones

519
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,470
now I teach a lot of you guys to pick

520
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,180
locks not all of you are good at it this

521
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,240
is a lock that was in my beginner

522
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,300
practice picking box for 5 years and

523
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,190
this is why locks eventually stopped

524
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,580
working

525
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,039
here's a lock that's been picked once

526
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:49,129
with a very light touch even this leaves

527
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:51,080
marks possibly a little bit hard to see

528
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,999
during the forensic process you're not

529
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:55,039
just taking a photo and then examining a

530
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,899
photo you're looking at it with various

531
00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:59,089
light sources at various angles and all

532
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:00,349
parts of the pan and so on

533
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:02,089
but even here you can see some scratches

534
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:05,869
here on the left here up here on the on

535
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:09,349
the tip and remember that the amount of

536
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:11,119
use is necessary to wipe some of these

537
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,029
traces off is very high right so 1500

538
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:15,950
uses how many times realistically would

539
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,039
a commercial door be used say to three

540
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,469
times a day that's a lot of days before

541
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:24,769
some of that stuff's worn off and marks

542
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:25,969
are left on different parts of the lock

543
00:21:25,969 --> 00:21:29,089
or the pin so the sides of the pin are a

544
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,820
very distinct feature so the key never

545
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,889
touches the sides of the pin because it

546
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:35,599
would just get stuck either going in or

547
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,950
coming out of the lock if you think of

548
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,929
how it works right this is why the key

549
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:40,729
has the slopes in between each of the

550
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:42,950
cuts to help assist it going in and out

551
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,289
of lock without getting stuck so you can

552
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:46,700
see some scratches coming down the side

553
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,570
here one on the left here very big and

554
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,679
again these are in places and and angles

555
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,539
and sizes that are not consistent with

556
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:59,929
normal keys so all the way up the side

557
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:04,729
of the pin obviously not a key in the

558
00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:06,979
Chamber's for the pins themselves again

559
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:08,779
someplace that the key can never get to

560
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:10,639
you can scratch there with the pic as

561
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:13,629
well so here's a number of scratches and

562
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:15,859
from this you can extrapolate some

563
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:17,599
information like the type of pick

564
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,570
they're using specifically the thickness

565
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,799
usually there's some material transfer

566
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,139
between your pick and the lock even in

567
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:25,940
the case of steel picks and brass locks

568
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,979
and so on you can find marks in places

569
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:33,169
that nothing in the lock touches so this

570
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:36,379
is a photo of the top of the key way so

571
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:39,109
you could see the chamber hole here this

572
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,239
the the key cannot touch this place

573
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:43,190
because if it did you you wouldn't be

574
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,599
able to put your key in the lock because

575
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:47,479
it'd be too tight right

576
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:48,919
but here you could see some scratches

577
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:53,389
again caused by lock picking here's some

578
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:54,460
more so

579
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,720
you might say that this one in the

580
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,310
center like this this long lateral

581
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,640
scratch is the key maybe right maybe it

582
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,110
had a piece of sand is like the usual

583
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,030
example everybody gives what if I had

584
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,980
sand all over my keys first of all I

585
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,570
don't know what monsters have like their

586
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,260
keys in their pocket filled with sand

587
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,310
but it just it just doesn't work like

588
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,020
that and then a mark like this for

589
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,030
example is just not something the key

590
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,880
can do if it was some protrusion on the

591
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,590
key or a miscut key or something it

592
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,500
would happen from the point that the key

593
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,480
meets the face of the lock to where that

594
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,010
cut is right it wouldn't just suddenly

595
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,150
appear in the back of the lock like this

596
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,820
here are the places between the chambers

597
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,530
so these are the chambers and then these

598
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,730
are kind of the posts in between

599
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,460
separating them you could see on that

600
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,190
first middle part here very distinct

601
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,560
mark again at an angle and consistent

602
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,910
with key use and consistent with

603
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,730
anything other than lock picking or

604
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,570
manipulation now the torque tool that's

605
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,700
used if you looked in the example you'll

606
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,590
saw that there's a manipulation tool and

607
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,930
a torque tool the torch will also leaves

608
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,210
marks depending on where its place so

609
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:05,130
here you can see scratch right here

610
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,230
you'll see scratches if you cut the plug

611
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,400
in half you'll see normally if for those

612
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,600
of you who picked a lock when you put

613
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,800
your torque tool in it usually doesn't

614
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,420
sit right the first time and you have to

615
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,130
kind of fiddle with it to get it nice

616
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,110
and snug you'll get this little scratch

617
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,420
pattern like here trying to get it in

618
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:28,420
the right place here's some more now

619
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,310
again beginner lock Pickers have a

620
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,780
tendency to put the pick all the way

621
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,610
through the lock you if you've been to

622
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,990
Def Con you've probably seen people with

623
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,490
a pick hanging out the back

624
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,230
obviously you can't pick a lock like

625
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,180
that but in locks where they have the

626
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,600
cam still on so like real box often

627
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,100
beginners will scratch the back of the

628
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,050
cam now the cam is interesting because

629
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,060
it's it's made from a much different

630
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,290
material typically like very I don't

631
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,880
know better were than shitty sorry very

632
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,290
shitty metal and you'll notice there's

633
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,940
lots of corrosion on this because unlike

634
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,100
the the functional moving parts of the

635
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,750
lock it doesn't really matter if this

636
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,730
slowly corrodes over time because it's

637
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,850
very slow

638
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,780
and it doesn't affect the lock

639
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,120
functionally so you could do more

640
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,100
advanced stuff like determining when

641
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,660
this mark was made based on the

642
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,980
corrosion of the surrounding material

643
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,920
versus the freshness of the cut for

644
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,260
picking itself you if you it's a very

645
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,300
high profile case you can do brass

646
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,270
oxidation testing the idea is like you

647
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,100
bite an apple you let it sit in the air

648
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,050
something happens to it the same happens

649
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:34,280
with everything to some extent but very

650
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,550
expensive not common to do again

651
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,010
beginners often really scratch the back

652
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:43,550
of this so not a normal thing how many

653
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:48,590
of you know what a pick gun is I was

654
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,970
going to add a second part to see if I

655
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,180
got more hands up but um so a pick gun

656
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,610
is this a tool that looks like a flat

657
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,160
piece of metal that slaps all the pins

658
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,170
causing them to jump it's a locksmithing

659
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,270
tool used to open locks but shockingly

660
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,740
some burglars have tried to use this and

661
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,420
it's a little bit different than lock

662
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,740
picking because the way it works is like

663
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,230
a spring bias thing that slaps the pins

664
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,760
right so it's not this act of like

665
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,290
probing and moving around with with

666
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,640
tools it's one motion that snaps and in

667
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,780
doing so it leaves a very different

668
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,260
marks so characterized by a number of

669
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:28,460
not curvy flat impressions against all

670
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,160
the bases of all the pins you could tell

671
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,890
how many times they pull the trigger

672
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,690
specifically if they a very common

673
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,430
mistake is to be slightly touching the

674
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,130
cam because it has a arc of motion so

675
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,630
often they'll just put it all the way in

676
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,360
and then snap it and so you can see how

677
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,310
many times they use that another great

678
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,680
material transfer because this is a much

679
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,540
more invasive process than the act of

680
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,400
picking where you're scraping in one big

681
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,860
motion things from the lock so if you

682
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,870
find it pick on on a suspect you do

683
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,940
advance material testing to say does

684
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,830
this pick on have residue from this lock

685
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,410
and the medals and the data manufacturer

686
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,510
estimated data manufacturer of a lot of

687
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,160
these is so specific that it's enough to

688
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,070
tie people to places which is a vehicle

689
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,380
for investigation and suspect

690
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,700
identification and so on

691
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,409
how many of you know what key bumping is

692
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:24,360
so funnily enough pick guns and key

693
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,619
bumping work on the same fundamental

694
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:27,419
principle this idea that by applying

695
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,399
kinetic force via some delivery

696
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,980
mechanism you cause the pins to jump so

697
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,480
in the case of the pick gun it's this

698
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,429
swinging arm in the case of key bumping

699
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:38,730
it's a key with a special cut pattern

700
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,009
being hit into the lock so key bumping

701
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:44,309
is very strong and in terms of like

702
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:47,070
covert entry its it's sort of like very

703
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,929
lightly destructive not that your lock

704
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:51,240
won't work but it's much more impactful

705
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,409
than some of the other stuff we talked

706
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,419
about you can expect to see marks in a

707
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,659
lot of these places so again we are

708
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:00,600
taking a cut key it's not a working key

709
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,279
otherwise you wouldn't need anything to

710
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,110
do but turn the key but you're taking a

711
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,610
cut key you're hitting it into the lock

712
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,830
causing big dents across all the key

713
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,470
pins right so that's not normal right

714
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,059
this is not something a key normally

715
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,679
does and I've met some pretty

716
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,179
heavy-handed people but I've never seen

717
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,789
somebody go you know in one clean motion

718
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:24,659
to get their key in the lock right you

719
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:28,429
can tell based on the very microscopic

720
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:31,259
pattern of the the marks whether or not

721
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:32,940
it was a handmade bump key a machine

722
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,549
bump key so on so here the marks are

723
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:36,389
much more Scratchy

724
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:37,950
more likely to be a hand filed or

725
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,230
dremeled key then a nicely cut key off a

726
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,710
machine key bumping has an interesting

727
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,080
effect on the pins itself because unlike

728
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,490
lock picking where we're more or less

729
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,840
just pushing that up and down against

730
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,940
the spring where we're violently

731
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,759
impacting them with typically brass on

732
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,240
brass or steel on brass and as a result

733
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,399
it causes deformations over time to the

734
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:02,789
plug shape so it'll slowly stretch out

735
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:04,200
the the chambers in different ways

736
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,480
because imagine what happens for those

737
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,559
of you have never done this it doesn't

738
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,960
just work with one hit sometimes it

739
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,379
takes 5 10 20 hits to do this and the

740
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:15,450
idea is that you if it doesn't work

741
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,950
what's happening is that the key is

742
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,200
being slammed into a pin and that pin is

743
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,840
trying to move under the force of the

744
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,600
key going against it right so it slowly

745
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,960
deforms the chamber sizes and shapes so

746
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,419
you can see here the sides of it are now

747
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:30,690
so

748
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:35,730
to work now we talked earlier the

749
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,470
shoulder is what stops the key from

750
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,940
going with locks so in the process of

751
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,440
key bumping you're impacting the

752
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,020
shoulder of the key into the plug the

753
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,270
face of the plug the the marks look much

754
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,710
different than normal way though as you

755
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,300
hopefully you can see now as a result of

756
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,800
some of the bumping techniques some of

757
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,720
them put the key in further than as

758
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,730
intended and as you know from looking at

759
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,500
your keys they get thicker towards the

760
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,920
bow of the key and the plug will in some

761
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,230
keys and some brands of lock will expand

762
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,510
as it tries to accommodate this violent

763
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,890
force of hitting the key a little bit

764
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,970
deeper into the lock than it was

765
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,510
intended

766
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,300
so you'll get this curling effect around

767
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,500
the edge of the keyhole

768
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,850
on the plug face so bypass is a generic

769
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,700
technique for things that try and bypass

770
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,160
the components that detain the lock from

771
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,280
rotating or actuated so in a typical

772
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,680
lock again we have a plug which is

773
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,510
connected to an actuator in a lot of

774
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,760
designs the actuator is not secured so

775
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,130
you can stick something in and manually

776
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,870
turn the actuator without moving any of

777
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,590
the pins for example there's a very fun

778
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,770
case of this in an American padlock many

779
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,630
years ago so this is the American 700

780
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,950
I'm sure many of you have seen it it's

781
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,220
just like that silver puck padlock with

782
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,710
the American logo master lock bought

783
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,390
American lock so if you bought a lock

784
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,490
recently you haven't seen it but in any

785
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,640
event the cam was exposed so you can

786
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,430
shove a picking tool like a very thick

787
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,380
pick tool in there and just turn it and

788
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,540
undo the shackle the padlock without

789
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,670
moving any of their pins because even

790
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,500
though they're mechanically coupled in

791
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,360
terms of like when the plug moves that

792
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,480
moves it's not in this lock they weren't

793
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,370
required to move together if that makes

794
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:17,700
sense

795
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,440
so you shove something in there and you

796
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,780
turn it obviously this is going to leave

797
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,730
a mark so you see on the right side of

798
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,920
this there's some deformation to the the

799
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,600
brass caused by the tool being wedged in

800
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,480
there this is actually a very

801
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,550
interesting story to me as a lock person

802
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,410
and a security person so the company

803
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,570
said oh oh is that right so they patched

804
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,670
it how did they patch it this is a

805
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,760
mechanical thing they released a little

806
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,650
disc with a part number and everything

807
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,400
it's a steel

808
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,830
and you put the disc over this so that

809
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,480
it blocks it and now you can't shove

810
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,330
your tool in and the locksmithing supply

811
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,830
company that made the tools that oh oh

812
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,409
is that right oh well then so they made

813
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:59,330
a tool to punch a hole in the metal disc

814
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,190
so this is the disc this is what it

815
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,900
looks like when it blocks an attempt to

816
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,140
do this I have no desire to like smash

817
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,059
holes in my stuff but you can imagine a

818
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,370
hole here if you look this up bypassed

819
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,630
American southern Honor there's lots of

820
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,490
documentation on this I thought it was a

821
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,110
very fascinating story of like cat and

822
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,690
mouse and the physical side of things

823
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,520
where it's not so easy to patch things

824
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,080
that are installed in the field

825
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,970
so very quickly we'll talk about keys so

826
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,220
analysis of keys is often a part of this

827
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,799
stolen keys are a big thing duplicated

828
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,799
keys are a big thing all of this can be

829
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:36,690
to some extent tracked and analyzed

830
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,899
forensically specifically whether or not

831
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,270
keys are original so specifically if

832
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,220
they are aftermarket keys copied keys

833
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,039
factory original keys so on so when when

834
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,620
a key is stolen or or copied then the

835
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,110
the duplicate key is not the original

836
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,000
typically it's typically a third party

837
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,240
blank or made manually using a meal or

838
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,340
something like this now 3d printing is

839
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,880
obviously popular determining if a key

840
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,200
is factory original is like a very

841
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,600
complex material analysis of how the key

842
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,600
was made when it was made manufacturing

843
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,409
methods of it and also there's other

844
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:16,860
things so if you go to like a corner

845
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,440
locksmith they will have it typically a

846
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,870
manual key copying machine so you clamp

847
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,779
in a source key and you clamp in a copy

848
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,330
key and it clamps it in there and in

849
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,490
clamping it you leave a mark

850
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,789
on the copy key and from this you can

851
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:34,620
also extrapolate it like what machine it

852
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,240
was based on the pattern of the clamp

853
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,710
and all this you know more advanced

854
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:43,080
stuff some of these use a stylus so it's

855
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,720
a metal bar that rides the key so that

856
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,730
it moves a cutting wheel with the bar to

857
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,799
figure out what should the pattern of

858
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:52,559
cuts be in doing so it's scraping a

859
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,600
metal piece against the source key so

860
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,130
you could determine if the source key

861
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,200
was copied using a machine like this

862
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,270
some very advanced forensic analysis can

863
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,640
be done to determine if two keys were

864
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,440
copied on the same machine using this

865
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,050
method based on microscopic evidence of

866
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,379
the the pattern that that stylus leaves

867
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:14,000
on that on the key that it copies

868
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,840
handmade keys were actually pretty easy

869
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,120
to spot just because they it's very hard

870
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,040
to make a handmade key that looks like

871
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,649
it wasn't hand made typically done via a

872
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:26,820
file Dremel sandpaper so on you can

873
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,129
obviously from traditional tool mark

874
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:30,360
analysis you could figure out what type

875
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,010
of file was used and all these kind of

876
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,340
stuff what type of Dremel was used and

877
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,520
again tie these back to a suspect if you

878
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,139
if they're found with a dremel or

879
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,889
something suspected of copying a key

880
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:44,760
another interesting thing is that you

881
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,190
could tell based on the pattern of

882
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:50,940
duplications for a man automatic key

883
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,389
copier what machine made it so you can

884
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:56,489
tell based on the size of cuts the speed

885
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:59,370
of cuts the the angles that the machine

886
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,280
takes and so on to figure out did you

887
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,100
know key a was this made on a XYZ

888
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,330
machine version 5 or whatever right so

889
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,070
bumping 4 bump keys obviously leave

890
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,170
evidence so as the bump keys used to

891
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,900
deforms based on impact you'd see here a

892
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,920
big hole so very easy to tell if a key

893
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,640
was used to bump something again just

894
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,620
like how the plug face takes damage the

895
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,570
bump key shoulder takes damage so again

896
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,340
from there you'll see that there's some

897
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,840
material transfer between the target

898
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:36,240
lock and this for other things you could

899
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,490
see if tools or keys were put in tools

900
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,840
so this is an example of vice grips

901
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,660
being used against a key very distinct

902
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,310
tool mark which then can be compared to

903
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,010
vice grips found on somebody's person so

904
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:52,800
on impression in terms of copying keys

905
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,630
is also very popular so I'm sure many of

906
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,220
you seen the clam shell kits and other

907
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,730
kinds of like wax silicon impression

908
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,050
sometimes very difficult to clean the

909
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,180
keys and also a very pristine looking

910
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,460
key is very unusual in the same sense

911
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,560
that you know a very pristine looking

912
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,750
lock is unusual one of the things people

913
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,190
said well hey data

914
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,440
I got it we're gonna pick the lock we're

915
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,550
gonna disassemble it we're gonna put new

916
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,339
pins in I said well they're probably not

917
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:19,770
gonna look the same as a lock that has

918
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,480
existed there for ten years or something

919
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,160
right and they said Oh we'll figure out

920
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,359
how many times they use it a day and

921
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,790
then we'll do it and you know this is

922
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,839
the what-if game that we don't want to

923
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,829
play but yeah so clay residues very

924
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:33,960
common for think things like this

925
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,000
because usually it's not very nice you

926
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,010
know casting clay it's it's whatever was

927
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,480
that the hobby store used to do this

928
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,910
which is then not inspected very

929
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:46,200
thoroughly to clean off so that's kind

930
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,880
of it just like a brief overview of this

931
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,940
I know I'm sure many of you have

932
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,010
questions I'm happy to take them I know

933
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,480
Katie wanted to work on a lock-picking

934
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,000
workshop sometime in the future so

935
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,589
bother Katie if you want that to happen

936
00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:09,529
here okay just me and you okay question

937
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,570
the question is what is the difference

938
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,430
between a medical lock and a standard

939
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:27,370
lock and why is it more secure medico

940
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,730
uses two things so the first is what's

941
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,650
called a side bar which is a secondary

942
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,640
set of cuts and that interfaces with a

943
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,590
secondary locking mechanism so it's like

944
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,800
a two-part lock in some sense now again

945
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,180
what did we learn everything is checked

946
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,730
one at a time so depending on which way

947
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,440
you rotate in the specifics of the lock

948
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,290
you will either bind the pins or the

949
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,210
side bar first and médicos pickelball as

950
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,030
a result because physics right every

951
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,730
lock is pickable as a result second is

952
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,890
that medico uses what's called axial

953
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,200
rotation so the pins are not just raised

954
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,810
to a position they must be raised and

955
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,540
rotated this is provided by angled cuts

956
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,870
on the key which rotate the the pins in

957
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,910
one of three orientations to interface

958
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:16,720
with the side bar so I wouldn't say

959
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,460
they're impossible to pick but certainly

960
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,950
they're they're a big step up from the

961
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,840
crappy quick set and Schlage locks that

962
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,730
you normally buy not that she legs and

963
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,560
quicks that don't make good locks but

964
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,930
the ones you buy at the hardware store

965
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,070
shockingly the ten dollar locks you buy

966
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:35,370
are not good locks question

967
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,540
I can test you okay

968
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,110
to an experienced lock-picker how long

969
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,870
does it take to pick the typical home

970
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,360
lock what is the question is what is the

971
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,920
average time to pick a typical

972
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,760
residential lock under a minute probably

973
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,960
again depends on the lock depends on the

974
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,260
specifics your your back door lock is

975
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,610
probably worse than your front door lock

976
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,130
which has an impact on it things like

977
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,600
that the considerations people don't

978
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,400
have right sorry there's a common a

979
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,250
common source of the steel for picks I

980
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,380
noticed that you showed us the side of

981
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,160
the profile of a worm gear hose clamp

982
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,390
and early on when you showed us pic do

983
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,000
you remember that I don't think I should

984
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,580
have picked other than an animation of a

985
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:39,180
pick well in your animation okay so

986
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,790
everything pick is from a from a

987
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,210
stainless steel hose clamp there we go

988
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,920
no no you're saying the the slots so

989
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,500
this this is obvious the the pic itself

990
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,240
those those slots are the slots you'll

991
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,340
find in a hose clamp and the hose clamp

992
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,080
is what people commonly used to make

993
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,930
these pets and those are gonna be three

994
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,670
or four through a five maybe four 10

995
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,640
stainless my question is about it's it's

996
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,930
irrelevant that they come from hose

997
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,640
clamps

998
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,350
well just to interrupt this is actually

999
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,820
not from a hose clamp it's just that the

1000
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,680
the person you made this slide designed

1001
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,390
a pic that looks like that okay which

1002
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,920
just happens to be similar to a hose

1003
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,850
clamp slots well continue please the

1004
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,970
question was actually about how you're

1005
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,590
identifying trace elements of the

1006
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,390
material left behind you using electron

1007
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,470
microscopy you using what do you use so

1008
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,970
again we talked about how I didn't go to

1009
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,610
school so what I use is I say hey lab

1010
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:38,130
tell me what's in this and they figure

1011
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:41,370
it out I believe the process they're

1012
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:45,840
using is mass spec typically but I am

1013
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,130
honestly not smart enough to answer this

1014
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:51,450
question sorry you gotta find the

1015
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,660
microphone

1016
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:59,589
thank you um sorry so my basic question

1017
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:02,140
was what's the scale you mentioned

1018
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,910
briefly in the passing that you don't

1019
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,829
use forensic lock-picking for your

1020
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:09,279
average burglary say um so I'm kind of

1021
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:11,229
curious because I'm imagining mission

1022
00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:14,259
impossible in my head right now um what

1023
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:17,410
is the scale of operations that requires

1024
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,200
forensic lock-picking and beyond that

1025
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,869
what would approximately if I had to put

1026
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:25,749
a price tag on it what would one

1027
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:28,269
mounting one of these operations cost to

1028
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:29,680
figure out you know how a certain lock

1029
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,380
was picked if the lock is made of for

1030
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,539
national security so to answer your

1031
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:36,039
first question again this is only done

1032
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:38,859
by insurance as a requirement law

1033
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:40,450
enforcement military obviously

1034
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:44,410
intelligence circles for very small

1035
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,509
scale applications of this they're not

1036
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:48,910
inspecting every lock ever certain

1037
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,979
military facilities will routinely do

1038
00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:52,450
like preventative maintenance where they

1039
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,059
take off all the locks on a small subset

1040
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:57,430
of doors to inspect them but otherwise

1041
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,449
this is not done regularly I would say

1042
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:04,119
and for price tag it's hard to say

1043
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:06,489
because it depends if you are asking me

1044
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:09,459
as an employee right so I work for a

1045
00:42:09,459 --> 00:42:11,109
facility am I doing that then obviously

1046
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:13,299
just whatever that guys normal salary is

1047
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:16,719
versus is a courtroom testimony required

1048
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:19,539
because that's a not not a very high

1049
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:21,369
price tag in a general sense but like

1050
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:23,949
it's required that you charge for it in

1051
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:27,249
many places thank you I was just sort of

1052
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:31,109
asking what the intended audience

1053
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:40,539
léo life experience I my home key I lost

1054
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:43,180
my home keys so I called a locksmith and

1055
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,940
he used very weird techniques I don't

1056
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,799
like that comment but he put a plastic

1057
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:50,469
bag over some kind of keys and within

1058
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:52,900
less than three seconds he able to open

1059
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,269
it but the lock is gone I ain't got to

1060
00:42:55,269 --> 00:42:57,369
buy spend lots of money buy a new one so

1061
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,380
his question is it's just a common

1062
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,229
practice what is the rationale behind or

1063
00:43:02,229 --> 00:43:04,690
he's just a shitty locksmith

1064
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,960
well sorry I'd say he got the lock open

1065
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,049
right so he can't be that bad of a

1066
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:16,210
locksmith so what the gentleman said in

1067
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,650
case you didn't hear it in the back was

1068
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,420
the the locksmith put some sort of

1069
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,890
plastic over a key put it in the lock

1070
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,289
open lock very rapidly this is what's

1071
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:25,780
called wall but he took the lock yeah of

1072
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,740
course because he wants to sell you a

1073
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,059
new one because that one sucks he got it

1074
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:33,069
open in three seconds right but the the

1075
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:35,020
what this is called is is self

1076
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,079
impression again think of how this works

1077
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,859
when you put a key in even if it's wrong

1078
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:43,539
the lock checks if it's in the right

1079
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:46,900
position so traditional impression is

1080
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,609
this process of putting a blank key in

1081
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:50,680
applying torque and then wiggling the

1082
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,230
key and since the component that's being

1083
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,299
bound cannot move it leaves the mark on

1084
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,530
the key and then you file it a little

1085
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,210
bit you repeat this process until you

1086
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,039
have a working key self impression egg

1087
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:02,380
is like the same thing but the act of

1088
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,510
just wiggling the key causes it to set

1089
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:07,059
all the things on your plastic key very

1090
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:10,390
rapidly and just open the lock so if you

1091
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,500
want to look it up it's called self

1092
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,089
impression or plastic impression

1093
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:17,140
impression alator it doesn't break

1094
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,920
anything

1095
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,539
I I don't know if I can answer if it's a

1096
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:27,160
scam or not because I I didn't do it you

1097
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,079
know like that's a motive question that

1098
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:32,740
I don't know if I can answer but it is a

1099
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,539
common technique that I'm actually

1100
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:35,920
surprised your locksmith new because

1101
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,960
most most people don't do that but again

1102
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,400
it depends on the type of lock most

1103
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,930
normal pin tumbler locks are not

1104
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,970
susceptible to this so maybe it was a

1105
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,619
wafer lock which is a very low security

1106
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:45,730
lock or something something something

1107
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:52,029
right Eve specific key is design it to

1108
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:56,849
one specific like five cylinder thing

1109
00:44:56,849 --> 00:45:01,809
how does the master key works that cool

1110
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:06,099
open like 2020 lock sure so how does

1111
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:07,630
master keying work in a pinch and a lock

1112
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,930
so in our example we have one bottom pin

1113
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,480
a key pin and one driver pin right so

1114
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,369
there's only one position in which these

1115
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:17,640
can meet to allow the inner piece

1116
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,849
right in master keying they add a third

1117
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:23,249
pin and now there's two places at which

1118
00:45:23,249 --> 00:45:25,680
it can be it can either be keep in is at

1119
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,259
the shear line or the other set of pins

1120
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:29,999
is at the shear line right does that

1121
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:33,930
make sense you want a visual aid I think

1122
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,480
we can make this go hold on

1123
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:41,069
now if I accidentally pull up porn I'm

1124
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:44,720
just saying it's all in the game right I

1125
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:47,099
think it should be the first slide of

1126
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:55,859
this if I'm not mistaken or porn so here

1127
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:57,480
is an example of a master key log this

1128
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,940
make more sense so now there's three

1129
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,519
pins and again if you have a five pin

1130
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:04,349
lock and one of the chambers has a

1131
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:06,809
master pin now two keys work if two of

1132
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:08,609
the chambers have master pins how many

1133
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:13,049
how many work none of you went to math

1134
00:46:13,049 --> 00:46:17,759
class you could say come on get that

1135
00:46:17,759 --> 00:46:20,220
credit for gentleman's correct four keys

1136
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,589
work and so on so this lock has many

1137
00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:24,059
different keys that work on it because

1138
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:25,499
each of the chambers is master keyed

1139
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:27,480
right so this is - this is typical of

1140
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,009
like a very large installation where you

1141
00:46:29,009 --> 00:46:31,230
have a grand master key and then a sub

1142
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,839
grand master and you know specific area

1143
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,150
master keys and so on and so on so that

1144
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,589
is how master keying works in a nutshell

1145
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:41,880
they add pins we're just going to do the

1146
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:48,599
whole lock picking workshop right now if

1147
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,849
you've done this in court or testified

1148
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,970
in court when you analyze the scratches

1149
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:57,230
on say a pin or whatever is that treated

1150
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:01,319
like like it's definitely true like DNA

1151
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,529
or something or we'll question-how

1152
00:47:04,529 --> 00:47:06,210
except it is forensic locksmithing

1153
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:10,319
testimony so again most people do not

1154
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,980
know how locks work and lock a forensic

1155
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,440
locksmithing is a subset of traditional

1156
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,539
tool mark forensics in the same sense

1157
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:20,609
that ballistics is a subset of

1158
00:47:20,609 --> 00:47:24,089
traditional tool mark forensics the the

1159
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:26,099
hard part is not seeing the scratches

1160
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:28,019
right everybody could visually see the

1161
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:29,430
scratches typically the hard part is

1162
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,559
explaining why that is

1163
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:33,989
that is as well as again we talked about

1164
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:35,609
what five six different techniques

1165
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:36,779
there's there's hundreds of different

1166
00:47:36,779 --> 00:47:38,849
ways to open locks without even getting

1167
00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:41,759
into high security very specific tools

1168
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:45,420
to open specific locks so the testimony

1169
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,979
is typically accepted and there's a very

1170
00:47:46,979 --> 00:47:48,749
small nur of people in the world who do

1171
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:50,609
this specifically for a forensic

1172
00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:52,049
locksmithing obviously there's a lot of

1173
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:56,059
tool-mark investigators out there so I

1174
00:47:56,059 --> 00:47:58,140
think it's one of those Sciences where

1175
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,329
typically it speaks for itself and until

1176
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:02,609
you start getting into things like skill

1177
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:04,799
level and time requirements which are a

1178
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,979
little less objective more subjective

1179
00:48:07,979 --> 00:48:10,049
then typically it's not been a problem

1180
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:11,849
for me the problem for me is that I'm

1181
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:16,469
young and the opposing expert is like

1182
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:18,449
twice my age and there's like a mental

1183
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:20,430
thing most juries have where they trust

1184
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,920
these loyola back I has 30 more years of

1185
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,719
experience than data so he must be right

1186
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:27,660
it's been more of a problem for me now

1187
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,219
it's not always required that I present

1188
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:31,949
the the testimony I can provide a report

1189
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:33,359
which is submitted as evidence and then

1190
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,609
used by prosecution or defense as a

1191
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:37,739
piece of evidence that can be discussed

1192
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:41,640
and analyzed as part of this right but I

1193
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,769
think most cases don't get to the point

1194
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:45,869
where they are hinging on forensic

1195
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:48,150
locksmithing based evidence it's more of

1196
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:50,160
a starting point for figuring out like

1197
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,249
whodunit and and tying people to places

1198
00:48:53,249 --> 00:48:56,729
than it is for establishing motive and

1199
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:57,929
other things like that if that makes

1200
00:48:57,929 --> 00:48:58,319
sense

1201
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,150
which are much more deterministic in

1202
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,819
terms of how cases are won or lost I

1203
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:09,269
feel I am working on the age thing now

1204
00:49:09,269 --> 00:49:13,079
but it's a process so in this example

1205
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:15,299
since you have more pins does that mean

1206
00:49:15,299 --> 00:49:17,099
if you're picking it you have more

1207
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,199
chances to get it aligned that you can

1208
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:21,390
feel that's correct so the comment was

1209
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,549
in a master key system you you it's

1210
00:49:23,549 --> 00:49:25,229
easier to pick as a result of having

1211
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:29,490
more possible shear lines yes absolutely

1212
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,569
[Music]

1213
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:36,269
disassembly you could tell via

1214
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:37,829
disassembly you can't tell by looking at

1215
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:39,269
it I mean I've been working with locks a

1216
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:41,189
long time but I haven't been able to get

1217
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:43,470
that part yet can you feel like

1218
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,900
their question is can you feel that

1219
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,790
there's two of them there it's very

1220
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:49,020
difficult because you see they're much

1221
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,900
smaller than than a typical pin so these

1222
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,020
are spaced such that they are one key

1223
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,520
depth they're two key depths or three

1224
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,780
key depths or something like this based

1225
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,730
on the brand of lock so unless you like

1226
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,800
very methodically feel out and like

1227
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,770
intentionally over lift to try and catch

1228
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,750
the other possible shear line for that

1229
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,940
chamber very difficult to like intuit

1230
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,599
that and and as far as me pick the act

1231
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:14,040
of picking a lock you just want to open

1232
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,500
the lock you don't care about decoding

1233
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,260
the lock which is to derive what the key

1234
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,849
should be via manipulation there's

1235
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:22,560
there's other decoding techniques that

1236
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,750
do care about that but in lock picking

1237
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,060
it's like a frantic process it you

1238
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:30,420
versus time more so than establishing

1239
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:36,090
what the key is so in the cat-and-mouse

1240
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,859
game that you say is going on in this

1241
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:40,410
tree is that going on at all levels I'm

1242
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,450
curious from the sense of the twenty

1243
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:44,369
five dollar lock at Home Depot is there

1244
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:45,990
an active cat-and-mouse game there or is

1245
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,910
like no those locks he only has three

1246
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:50,520
seconds deal so that's actually a very

1247
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,960
good question the question is does the

1248
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,730
cat mouse game on the physical security

1249
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,740
side of the house happen at low security

1250
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:56,880
as well as high security so it obviously

1251
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,950
definitely happens at the high security

1252
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:03,119
level more so for patent expirations

1253
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,720
than for true innovation right so like

1254
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,270
if I challenge you guys in this room to

1255
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:12,900
name more than six American lock

1256
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,790
manufacturers or locks that you can buy

1257
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,800
in America I think most of you would be

1258
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,630
pretty hard pressed to get above that

1259
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:21,930
number whereas Rainier from Europe

1260
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:23,460
probably has no problem doing this

1261
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,710
because there's a dozen or two dozen

1262
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:28,200
countries very fiercely competing versus

1263
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,730
us we're like dude we got a quick side

1264
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:32,430
we got master lock we got Schlage hard

1265
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:35,339
it solved done right and without going

1266
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:36,900
to a specialty locksmith you're unlikely

1267
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,640
to ever see a high-security lock or what

1268
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,080
I would consider high-security lock or a

1269
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,609
medium security lock if you want to get

1270
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:44,280
very specific right so like a Medeco I

1271
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,960
would say is a medium security lock

1272
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,570
compared to the super exotic expensive

1273
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,970
stuff that I would really think of as a

1274
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,060
high-security lock and the can't mouse

1275
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,340
game only half

1276
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,920
when there's industry or social pressure

1277
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,720
to do so so a good example this is key

1278
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,930
bumping key bumping was an idea that's

1279
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,790
been around for a long time the first

1280
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,340
recorded notion of key bumping is in the

1281
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,770
1920s when a patent was filed for a

1282
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:13,010
really old like comically complex key

1283
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,470
bumping tool where it was like this you

1284
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:16,970
know very complicated thing that holds a

1285
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,740
key but if you look at it you go that is

1286
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,930
that is a bump key it's just the way of

1287
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,400
delivering the bump key wasn't just a

1288
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,630
hammer it was like this is a complex

1289
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,190
Rube Goldberg

1290
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:29,030
galled Berrien thing right but 1920

1291
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:31,070
right so locksmithing the community of

1292
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:32,900
locksmith very seasoned veteran

1293
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,700
locksmiths knew about it though it

1294
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,680
wasn't widely used to open locks but

1295
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,480
they understood that this is possible so

1296
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,200
in 2005 this was published by lock

1297
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,060
Pickers because they were like holy

1298
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,270
this is this is a problem right and the

1299
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,830
locksmithing community had a very bad

1300
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:50,210
reaction to that and they were like

1301
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,830
you're publishing trade secrets and so

1302
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:53,870
on and the way I viewed it was kind of

1303
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,120
like computers in the mid 90s when

1304
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,890
security vulnerabilities or suddenly

1305
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:59,480
started being published like very

1306
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,640
widespread and the industry freaks out

1307
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,680
and says you can't do that you know what

1308
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,390
are you doing right then they'll know

1309
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,890
about our problems and things like this

1310
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,990
and so I think the tech community

1311
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,730
obviously moves very quickly and locks

1312
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,310
are about 10 or 15 years behind that so

1313
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,170
we had the initial outcry from bumping

1314
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:18,230
some companies in particular well

1315
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,490
basically every company that could

1316
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:22,040
started trying to sell a bump proof or

1317
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,230
bump resistant lock some work some

1318
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:26,630
didn't just as a result of like they

1319
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:28,430
don't really understand what it was so

1320
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:30,500
for those of you who owned a quick set

1321
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,470
smart key this is the lock that has user

1322
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:35,540
rekey able features you could tell

1323
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,070
because it has a little hole to the left

1324
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:38,960
of the keyway used for the rekeying

1325
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,450
function this was made as an anti

1326
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:44,180
bumping thing so the the the way it's

1327
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,430
anti bumping is that it doesn't use pins

1328
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:48,920
in the same sense so if it's not a pin

1329
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,420
lock you can't bump it therefore this is

1330
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,820
bump proof not that it's a great lock

1331
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:53,690
but yes

1332
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:55,550
fundamentally you are correct it's like

1333
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:59,080
technically correct it is bomb proof and

1334
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,060
leg copy this they made the secure key

1335
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,410
they were sued by quick-set now you

1336
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:06,290
can't buy that other companies have have

1337
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:08,490
made locks that are just not pin locks

1338
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,410
but other than that there hasn't been

1339
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,000
really there's not a lot of motion

1340
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,680
because again think think of yourselves

1341
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,630
think of what you realistically do you

1342
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:17,460
go to the hardware store you see 10

1343
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,950
lakhs that all look basically exactly

1344
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,550
the same which one do you buy the cheap

1345
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,520
one of course right so what what impetus

1346
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,960
is there for the company to make a

1347
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:34,380
better lock so you are the problem but

1348
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,310
but do you know what I'm saying that's

1349
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,530
why and and some of the improvements

1350
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,300
they can make are like fractions of a

1351
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,480
sin but they're like who cares you know

1352
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,560
because then they'd have to charge a

1353
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,570
dollar more and then you wouldn't buy it

1354
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:06,180
all right is there some tips to buying a

1355
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,740
good lock that you would recommend

1356
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,860
that's a crazy good question sir

1357
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,200
so tips to buying a good lock so

1358
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,580
anything you can buy at the hardware

1359
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,820
store probably sucks just like in a

1360
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,800
general grand scheme of things right and

1361
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,630
then also you got to be realistic with

1362
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:23,850
yourself it's not computers you can't

1363
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,980
just like for free get the better

1364
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,020
encryption and in the same sense in the

1365
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,150
physical world right digital decisions

1366
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:32,040
are much more simplified in that I'll

1367
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,660
just go with a better thing but it

1368
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,280
doesn't cost you anything usually

1369
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,530
physically if you want a good lock you

1370
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:38,730
you can buy from a number of

1371
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:41,520
manufacturers you're restricted by the

1372
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,170
mounting options for the door so like

1373
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:45,720
will it actually go on your door so most

1374
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,250
European locks the standard European

1375
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,500
lock does not go on an American style to

1376
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,050
work they it's just different I guess

1377
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,140
it's the best way to describe it

1378
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,310
realistically the only high security

1379
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:58,250
locks you can buy in the US are medico

1380
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:01,500
multi lock you can buy a high-security

1381
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,990
Schlage which would be Schlage Primus is

1382
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:07,109
their their high-security line and then

1383
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:10,020
you can buy something online like if you

1384
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,400
want a padlock it's a little bit easier

1385
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,810
but a door lock you'll need to make sure

1386
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:14,910
you buy the actual correct format of

1387
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,190
door lock and all this kind of stuff if

1388
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:19,350
you want to buy like the what I think

1389
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:20,940
the best bang for your buck is if that's

1390
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,200
helpful I would

1391
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,049
ABLOY is an excellent lock that is not

1392
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,190
going to get picked not going to get

1393
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,710
bumped probably not going to get opened

1394
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,930
aside from destructive entry you can

1395
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:33,299
also buy a buy lock is an Australian

1396
00:56:33,299 --> 00:56:35,160
lock that's sold very commonly online

1397
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,279
also a very good lock again unlikely to

1398
00:56:38,279 --> 00:56:41,849
be picked bump so on but in the u.s.

1399
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:43,680
you're really only options are Schlage

1400
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,260
medico Multi lock and I'd be surprised

1401
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,059
if you get anything other than that if

1402
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:50,760
you want to go online again ABLOY abl oh

1403
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,500
I buy lock there's many others but those

1404
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,789
would probably be the easiest to acquire

1405
00:56:56,789 --> 00:57:10,349
for for an American consumer yep thank

1406
00:57:10,349 --> 00:57:12,529
you
