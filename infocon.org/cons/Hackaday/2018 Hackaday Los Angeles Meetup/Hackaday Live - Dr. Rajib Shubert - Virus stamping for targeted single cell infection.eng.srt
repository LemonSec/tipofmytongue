1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049
dr. Rosher Bert's come on up it's your

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,660
time oh yeah there we go that's

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,340
important so first of all thank you

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,469
Katie for having me yourens have all you

5
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:14,670
guys coming out here to listen to me

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,910
today so I wanted to start off I think I

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,470
was just having a discussion with the

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,600
other speaker today and Katie Elsa I

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,850
think we live in a very very exciting

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,189
time in biology there's some incredible

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,660
developments that are happening right

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,070
now that's gonna be really

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,030
transformative in our lifes now and the

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,559
talk that I'm about to give today about

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,270
this biophysical technique where you can

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,640
magnetize viruses and guide them to

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,620
single biological cells I wanted to

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,360
really give you guys an overview what's

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,980
everything that's going on right now and

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,770
how this can be developed for future

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,270
products okay but yeah before I give you

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,730
a reason why I went to look at single

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,930
cells and why are they important in

24
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,940
biology it's kind of give you this image

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,850
because my background is sort of in

26
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,739
physics also because my parents were

27
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,480
both theoretical physicists so you guys

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,430
can imagine what the talks were at

29
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,700
dinner but they keep so they keep him

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,380
around me at the golden age of physics

31
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,970
and all the technologies that we have

32
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,740
today you know basically came from this

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,920
this great congressional guys that came

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,340
over like I think you have you know Max

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,890
Planck Einstein Bohr and all these guys

36
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,650
came over to basically understand

37
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,750
basically the most fundamental element

38
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,970
of nature which is the atom and once we

39
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,829
understood that you know I we had all

40
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,570
these transformative technologies or my

41
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,740
cell phone computers 3d printing so with

42
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,110
that in mind in biology I think we've

43
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,570
kind of we want to take that same

44
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,460
approach so we want to also go back and

45
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,320
basically understand the fundamental

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,700
element of biology which is the cell and

47
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,200
I focus my work mainly on the brain

48
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,180
because it's just so it's fascinating

49
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,930
it's a fascinating organ it's an organ

50
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,899
that is very unique to us so for example

51
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,640
you know if we were able to do a kidney

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,439
transplant with you if I were to get

53
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,030
your kidney I think I could still

54
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,770
somehow say it's me but if I were to

55
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,410
transplant my brain pretty sure

56
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:17,040
we would think otherwise so yeah so I

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,110
just go back a thousand years actually

58
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,270
so we step back again in time about the

59
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,400
brain so yeah there's a

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,050
thousand-year-old image of a brain can't

61
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,290
really conceive much about it you can

62
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,850
see some eyes some eyes right there

63
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,430
that seemed to kind of have some wires

64
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,370
like just go in the back somewhere and a

65
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,790
nose and pretty much I would say there's

66
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,210
not much out here but I think everyone

67
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,920
in here will agree that our

68
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,270
understanding of the brain and its

69
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,380
connectivity has gotten substantially

70
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,970
more sophisticated now and the reason

71
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,030
why is before I go into that reason is I

72
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,560
wanted to like just give an analogy to

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,260
the computer since I think a lot of this

74
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,550
is big I think a lot of you guys are

75
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,070
more familiar with this guy out here and

76
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,050
if I were to ask you guys how this

77
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,720
computer works I think you guys are well

78
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,720
be kinda a little bit lost but if you

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,070
were to like to somehow crack it open

80
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,080
you know look at the internal circuits

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,060
but I think you would get a much better

82
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,180
idea for explaining this and so in

83
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,250
computers we not only can see these

84
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,290
circuits now to understand it we also

85
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,850
understand how they behave so we know

86
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,560
how the individual elements behave we

87
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,810
know there's a resistor capacitor and

88
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,330
these resistors and capacitors can form

89
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,040
you know junctions together to form

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,870
circuits and then these circuits can

91
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,700
connect with other circuits to give

92
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,080
output so similarly in biology about a

93
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,430
hundred years ago that was one of the

94
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,290
first Nobel Prizes by romona Kahala what

95
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,750
he was able to do was guess crack open

96
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,160
the brain and really look at the inner

97
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,900
elements so he was able to

98
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,900
stochastically label these elements call

99
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,270
the neuron but he wasn't able to really

100
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,530
get at the single cell level but

101
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,790
basically he could finally we could

102
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,700
finally visualize what's in there and on

103
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,810
the other end now there was another

104
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,170
Nobel Prize in 1944 and the nuclear

105
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,430
magnetic resonance where we could

106
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,080
actually see the activity of the whole

107
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,440
brain but the challenge has been really

108
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,390
like linking these two you know linking

109
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,850
how just the most basic element a single

110
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,620
neuron how does it behave how does it

111
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,329
connect

112
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,858
and these are the questions I want to

113
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:27,229
answer with my technology now so what we

114
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,060
have arrived now it's it's evolved a lot

115
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,530
in a hundred years what we've been able

116
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,189
to do is take two two elements basically

117
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:37,520
some of the it's the virus out here and

118
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,740
nuclear magnetic resonance we have been

119
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,210
able to basically it's been developed

120
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,509
significantly now and well my goal is to

121
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:46,849
really combine a very primordial element

122
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:48,800
that nature's engineered for billions of

123
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,180
years and something that we have

124
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,460
engineered recently and the idea is to

125
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,610
simplify this simplify this and have a

126
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,919
very simple tool to address this very

127
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,719
complex question of how does the brain

128
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:02,210
work and ultimately how does our body

129
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,180
work so the principle is very simple you

130
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,400
just take a magnetic nanoparticle and

131
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,580
your tether there tether it to a virus

132
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,680
and you can basically fill this in a in

133
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,889
a capillary and you fill it with a

134
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,479
contrast dye because your body's dark

135
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,430
here to look inside your body there's no

136
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,409
light in there so you pierce this

137
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,240
capillary you can guide it to your

138
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,069
target cell of interest by flushing out

139
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:27,590
this dye and then you turn the magnet on

140
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,580
and it can deliver this virus payload so

141
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,810
this is just an image now what we did

142
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,849
with our experiments this isn't a live

143
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:36,440
mouse's brain that's why it's moving

144
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,919
around and these black images are

145
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,839
actually the neurons in there and what

146
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,250
we're doing is we're flushing dye out of

147
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,620
this capillary right now and then as it

148
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,990
approaches a cell of interest we just

149
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,129
turn the magnet on and you see a quick

150
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:54,650
flash of this so it's not just enough to

151
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,690
just label a single neuron it's not just

152
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,430
enough to just take a virus that's

153
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,979
encoding some kind of contrast dye or

154
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:02,960
protein it's important to really

155
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,839
understand the whole system so we want

156
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,849
to understand not only how the elements

157
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:09,259
look like how do these neurons look like

158
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,000
the structure you also want to

159
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,319
understand how it behaves because we're

160
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,020
not just static static beings and

161
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,460
ultimately we want to understand from

162
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,659
this function how does this drive

163
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:21,319
behavior and then yeah goal would be to

164
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,300
combine these three elements to create a

165
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,479
synthetic brain so the first thing I'll

166
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,580
talk about is how this technology was

167
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,680
able to decode structure but before that

168
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,600
I just want to give a background because

169
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,280
feel like everything's been changing so

170
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,290
fast in biology so they came up with

171
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,470
this it's this thing called green

172
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,600
fluorescent protein the idea is that it

173
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,250
came from a jellyfish it's a

174
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,950
bioluminescence it's it essentially they

175
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,840
could genetic and clone this into

176
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,100
different animals and turn them

177
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,070
fluorescent so it was a pretty cool

178
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,560
thing so what we did was we encoded this

179
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,140
green fluorescent protein in our viruses

180
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,840
and we drove them to single cells and we

181
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,370
were able to actually visualize all

182
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,470
these different kinds of neurons know so

183
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,390
for example this isn't uh this isn't a

184
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:10,430
cortex of a mouse and this isn't and we

185
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,990
wanted to go the next stage then not

186
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,030
just look at these neurons by themselves

187
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,080
but we also want to look at the

188
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,820
connectivity because ultimately it's the

189
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,210
it's the connectivity that really gives

190
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,290
the output of the neuron and the

191
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,030
behavior just like electrical circuits

192
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,880
and yeah and yeah neurons connect in a

193
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,860
very special evict manner they they send

194
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,510
out these long structures called axons

195
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,260
to

196
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,660
receivers called dendrites and so signal

197
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,480
goes from A to B to C so in a very

198
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,880
precise manner so there have been some

199
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,530
other technologies now to look at the

200
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,240
connectivity of all the neurons in the

201
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,800
brain one of them was this very

202
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,390
beautiful technique called the brain bow

203
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,220
essentially they wanted to color code

204
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,290
all the neurons in our brain by

205
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,360
injecting viruses that deliver delivery

206
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,310
different fluorophores but you could

207
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,800
imagine now what the limitation with

208
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,560
this with this would be our brain has

209
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,360
over a billion neurons and over a couple

210
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,870
of 10 trillion synapses so it's

211
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,980
astronomical and number so you can just

212
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,510
imagine there just not enough colors to

213
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:13,520
really do this so there is a pretty cool

214
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,900
tool this is what Mother Nature

215
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,790
developed for us and this is what we

216
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,650
wanted to integrate by magnetizing these

217
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,340
viruses

218
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,220
it's the rabies virus it's it's

219
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,570
something that we really think of that's

220
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,790
gonna be really harmful to us but what

221
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,410
we have been able to is engineer this

222
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,600
now in such a way where we can actually

223
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,460
use this for tracing connectivity and

224
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,760
controlling neurons the reason why we

225
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,349
chose Davies was a couple of interesting

226
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,900
features of it not only can we engineer

227
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,839
to deliver specific cargo but also the

228
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,059
way its intrinsic property of how it

229
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:44,570
travel

230
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,060
and also the fact that it it's near

231
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,280
specific so that's some of the really

232
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,750
cool things about viruses how they've

233
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,530
evolved they have been able to not only

234
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,060
be these genetic elements that can

235
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,040
deliver a specific cargo but they go to

236
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,600
very specific cell types and very

237
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,220
interesting is last thing I say is that

238
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,780
it travels retrograde which means it

239
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,460
travels it has a directionality in its

240
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,060
travel so as I said usually signals Trap

241
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,830
Harbor Gate from let's say you're on a

242
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,050
tour neuron bead and you're on sea but

243
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,730
in this case what happened rabies is it

244
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,200
travels backwards so if you were to

245
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,540
infect neuron B it would go and in fact

246
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,160
neuron a so you can actually look at the

247
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,360
origins of the signal so yeah as I

248
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,740
mentioned we've been able to engineer

249
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,810
these rabies viruses now so we took a

250
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,600
very pathogenic rabies virus what we did

251
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,160
was we deleted its genome for

252
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,660
replication and replaced it with

253
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,660
fluorophores and so all of now all of a

254
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,830
sudden what you can do is you inject

255
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,660
this rabies it wouldn't spread continue

256
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,550
continue to spread but in essentially

257
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,530
just in fact the first neurons it

258
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,020
touches and then we can take a second

259
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,560
virus which is an engineered it's

260
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,480
essentially HIV virus so it's a lending

261
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,380
virus but it's its origins are from HIV

262
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,350
and this HIV can ask act as a switch it

263
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,360
can turn the rabies on again to jump

264
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,190
across one more synapse so it can

265
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,200
continually you can always turn it on

266
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,610
and off yeah and we can use deuce to

267
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,960
cool stuff like this so what we can do

268
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,540
is we co deliver this so this red neuron

269
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,940
out here is they start a neuron and what

270
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,320
we did was we triggered it with the

271
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,420
lenti to turn it on so that's what's

272
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,940
yellowish there and it jumps across to

273
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,400
us all is connected presynaptic cells so

274
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,170
we can basically look the connectivity

275
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,760
from a single neuron now so we basically

276
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,620
have a single network what we're looking

277
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,060
at out here and so it's not just enough

278
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,250
to look at the network itself now at a

279
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,050
single so look at a look at the

280
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,150
connection from a single neuron but we

281
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,240
also want to look at its function so as

282
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,800
I mentioned this green fluorescent

283
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,310
protein so far I've only shown you

284
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,730
static images but what happened was

285
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,840
recently is only about like five six

286
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,340
years ago they were able to make this a

287
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,270
dynamic element

288
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,590
can actually look at the activity of

289
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,810
your connected neurons now so what they

290
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,490
can do is basically tether this green

291
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,080
fluorescent protein to a protein called

292
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,840
calmodulin which responds to calcium

293
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,850
influx --is which are neurons basically

294
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,250
used for firing electrical signals and

295
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,810
you can actually look at it real-time

296
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,340
now so if you look at this image now it

297
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,780
goes from a static and you can actually

298
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,180
look at the neurons firing right now and

299
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,160
so you can actually look at how it's

300
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,620
processing signals so so this is a great

301
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,940
way to read out what the neuron is

302
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,600
telling you there's a yeah that's a nice

303
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,930
flash burst so there's another cool

304
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,370
technologies that only came out three

305
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,490
years ago which is actually 2013/2014

306
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,920
which is called optogenetics so this is

307
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,080
really cool where they took a protein

308
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,600
from an alligator's protein what it can

309
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,240
do is it can be light triggered so they

310
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,100
can take this protein and put it in a

311
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,470
biological cell and basically switch it

312
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,750
on or off so wanted this is an example

313
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,220
of an application that was done in our

314
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,160
lab what we did was a hooked up a wire

315
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,620
that delivers blue light and what we did

316
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,900
was injected some of these viruses that

317
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,930
encode this optogenetic protein so in a

318
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,570
normal state when this laser is off the

319
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,700
mouse is not feeding but when it turns

320
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,160
on a container to basically start eating

321
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,860
again so just take a look at this video

322
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,470
out here it's not interested now trigger

323
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,770
starts eating

324
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,939
and yeah I think it should switch off

325
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:32,610
now

326
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:38,670
yeah and it's disinterested again yeah

327
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,209
and we can turn it on again I think we

328
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:44,649
should turn out yeah there we go and we

329
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:46,230
can trigger to eat again

330
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,370
so it's mind control yes it's

331
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,600
essentially mind control yes so we

332
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,589
wanted to integrate both of these

333
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:54,879
technologies so we did it at a

334
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,339
single-cell level and what we did was we

335
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:58,930
can put G camp where it starts firing

336
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,629
and then we flash it with us optogenetic

337
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:03,250
light this blue light and we can

338
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,889
essentially turn it off so with this

339
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:07,899
technology now at a single-cell level we

340
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:09,939
can really understand how this neuron

341
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,620
really dissect it you know turn it off

342
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,180
turn it on you know see what the

343
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,720
properties are so we wanted to use this

344
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,399
now finally to really take these two

345
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,009
readout and controlling technologies to

346
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,480
really understand behavior and even

347
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,050
control it

348
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,689
maybe so what we did this is

349
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:27,189
unfortunately can't do this with humans

350
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:32,889
but so we gave this mouse a very simple

351
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:34,899
movie because the vision is very easy

352
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,300
for it to perceive and for us all it's a

353
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,759
readout so we had two systems here first

354
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,439
as a movie we gave it a very simple

355
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:43,870
movie just for the simplicity sake so we

356
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,279
gave this movie it's a very boring movie

357
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,410
I had had to watch it while I was doing

358
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,649
this experiment so especially these

359
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,509
horizontal bars that are moving left and

360
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:54,850
right up and down and we can switch it

361
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,949
around so the ideas it's a very simple

362
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:58,959
directional sensitivity cue that we can

363
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,970
give it and the ideas we can deliver

364
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,009
this as I said this rabies virus that's

365
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,180
magnetized delivered to specific cell

366
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,910
and then essentially look at how this

367
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,709
mouse perceives vision look at the

368
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,990
neural code of vision essentially so

369
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,059
here's the circuit again that's actually

370
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:18,279
the visual cortex and now you can see

371
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,899
actually these are the neurons that are

372
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,459
shown in green out here but they're

373
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,139
shown in black and white just to

374
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:25,629
increase the contrast here but I give it

375
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,850
certain visual cues and you can see that

376
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,720
only certain neurons respond to certain

377
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,660
visual cues and what we can do with this

378
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,519
now from this movie is basically

379
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,790
reconstruct all the neurons and see

380
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,770
basically what their firing patterns are

381
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,410
and how they connect to each other and

382
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,660
thereby basically decode basically this

383
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,760
visual circuit so you can understand

384
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,800
that we can apply the same thing for

385
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,160
other things like the circuit for hunger

386
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,370
so the circuit for memories you can

387
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,140
literally take this technology now and

388
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,420
upload or even download memories that's

389
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,620
that's one of the things we're looking

390
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,750
at right now

391
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,140
so finally we wanted to use all this

392
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,820
know-how at the single cell level to

393
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,290
really see how we could possibly

394
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,650
engineer a synthetic brain but before I

395
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,360
go into that I wanted to talk about a

396
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,100
really really cool technology that came

397
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,960
out only recently won the Nobel Prize in

398
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,020
2012 it's this technology of IPSC

399
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,390
neurons sorry IPS II cells so it's

400
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,100
called for induced pluripotent stem

401
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,050
cells so the idea is that you could take

402
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,890
any cell from my body re-engineer it to

403
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,500
form a stem cell at the stage and then

404
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,040
you can either take viruses or standard

405
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,140
gene transfection technologies to

406
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,270
basically tell this stem cell now to

407
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,580
form any cell in our body so you can

408
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,700
basically trigger it to form neurons or

409
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,170
heart cells kidneys whatever so

410
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,670
basically can build a personalized organ

411
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,570
now and they have had some issues with

412
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,060
this of course the issue mainly has been

413
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,770
at the organ stage now so they have been

414
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,840
able to basically form neurons or heart

415
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,430
cells kidney cells but then to actually

416
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,830
form a functional kidney because they

417
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,090
don't know how single cells really

418
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,100
differentiate and behave they have been

419
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,510
basically getting very pancake-like

420
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,730
structures so I just it's a very small

421
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,070
cartoon but liver essentially looks like

422
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,230
an IHOP pancake right now but it has all

423
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,140
the cell types so that's where we wanted

424
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,310
to come in we would really wanted to see

425
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,110
through develop and what happens to a

426
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,390
single cell and again as I said my focus

427
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,000
was the brain so we looked at cerebral

428
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,820
organoids and what we did was we put a

429
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,960
contrast fluorophore and a rabies virus

430
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,970
and we tagged a single brain organoid

431
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,580
and then after around 300 days almost a

432
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,720
year before saw a basic element a retina

433
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,190
form out here and the rest of the brain

434
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,080
and

435
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,270
we can see out here this was an issue it

436
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,920
was a retinal ganglion cell so these are

437
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,600
these cells that send this long optic

438
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,220
nerve from your eye back to your brain

439
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,780
and you can actually see these optic

440
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,680
nerves farm so yeah so this was like

441
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,310
these are the elementary stages now so

442
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,520
so I wanted to end it now with yeah so

443
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,410
where we wanted to go with this so

444
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,480
before that I just show you this there's

445
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,099
no music playing on this so I wanted

446
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,209
actually this this was a very

447
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,640
interesting experiment so this was

448
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,630
actually shown in the Zurich Film

449
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,180
Festival because there what we were

450
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,709
doing out here was actually playing the

451
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,630
the mouse music and it was actually

452
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,030
responding to the music itself so we

453
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,210
could actually decode the the musical

454
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,310
circuits off the mouse you know so

455
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,230
unfortunately musics nothing but it's

456
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,850
okay so but anyway so I end this talk

457
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,300
okay

458
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,650
with a very simple well with the falling

459
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,720
thought you know so we took we looked at

460
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,880
a very complex system and we developed a

461
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,280
very simple methodology and the idea is

462
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,630
that if we could really understand these

463
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,210
elements one cell at a time we would

464
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,590
really be able to really open the

465
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,630
floodgates in terms of engineering

466
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,760
whatever we want essentially now and

467
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,540
really control them so yeah saying that

468
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,860
thank you very much

469
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:10,919
[Applause]
