00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,909
[Applause]

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:05,819
all right good evening everybody like it

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,830
says here my name is Renier van de Leeuw

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,780
I would like to talk about Laura a

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,809
network that we're building in our

6
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:17,310
community in Temecula supposed to here

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:17,760
you go

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,310
so this is a picture of me installing

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,279
sensors in a in an orchard I've been

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,289
living in this in Temecula since last

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,550
year I own a small vineyard it's kind of

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,759
between commercial vineyard and and a

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,610
hobby vineyard it's it's too large to

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,980
manage by myself and too small to make

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,290
to make it my job so it's kind of like

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,670
in the middle

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,969
I started Findlay know as as a project

18
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,430
and I submitted it to hackaday as

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,180
Jasmine was telling and it basically was

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,629
a project started for myself how do I

21
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,670
manage irrigation in my vineyard and

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,250
then it turned out into an open source

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,890
project and now I'm the CEO of my own

24
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,260
company running that and you know thanks

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,210
to hackaday and the heck of a price I

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,799
got the seed money to get started on

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,490
that and then you see some prizes if you

28
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,869
want to reach out to me after the

29
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,760
presentation and you can get a hold of

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,040
me here's my email address and also my

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,900
phone number feel free to reach out

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,689
anytime well not not not at night of

33
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,220
course but so what is Laura that's

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,689
basically what I wanted to discuss about

35
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,490
because we started with irrigation and

36
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,189
the needs arose to have a wireless

37
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,490
technology that can transport sensor

38
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,259
data over a long distance and as we are

39
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,590
using battery-operated sensors we want

40
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,259
to do that in a very power efficient way

41
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,820
and when I got started in 2015 looking

42
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,070
into this I started with a handheld

43
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,409
reader so I had to walk around and then

44
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,180
connect the wires of every sensor and

45
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,030
take reading and just go on and on then

46
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,649
I thought well that's not a very

47
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,750
efficient way of getting getting data

48
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,580
from my vineyard can I do it wirelessly

49
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,038
I

50
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,219
I made a prototype with Wi-Fi but the

51
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,739
range of Wi-Fi was just not enough to

52
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,840
get to get where I wanted I got to the

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,670
first row of the vineyard and that was

54
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,400
about all the range I could get and then

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,159
with Laura I can I can get even further

56
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,430
so we get in principal about five to ten

57
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,950
miles range of you know and then run

58
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,750
over battery for more than a year which

59
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,640
is kind of incredible if you you think

60
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,060
about it anyway so this technology

61
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,730
allows for low energy it's low speed is

62
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,879
not my fight you cannot do over-the-air

63
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,379
firmware updates yeah you can there's

64
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,510
talk about it but I I don't recommend it

65
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,260
and it's suitable for battery operated

66
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,639
devices so small data packets the the

67
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:59,299
typical fair use policy is that you use

68
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:01,760
30 seconds air time per day and if you

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,169
have a typical half a second

70
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:04,970
transmission time and you can calculate

71
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,700
how often you can you can go online with

72
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,209
this technology it's a star tech start

73
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,669
topology so it's not that the notes talk

74
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,019
to one another and pass on the message

75
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:17,599
every node talks directly to the Gateway

76
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,900
so that's basically also the topology

77
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,530
and the way it works is that the Gateway

78
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,250
has multiple channels in the US you have

79
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,879
64 channels in the in Europe you have 8

80
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,569
channels but the the nodes can switch

81
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,970
channels and that means that a lot of

82
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,540
stations can share the same airspace so

83
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,319
a typical gateway can support thousands

84
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,790
of nodes and that means that you can use

85
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,709
it in a dense populated area like a

86
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,290
metropolitan area like LA if you want to

87
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,540
build a smart city that that can one

88
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,549
Gateway if it's placed high enough and

89
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:00,859
it has enough range it can support like

90
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:06,019
thousands and thousands of nodes so in

91
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:07,909
temecula we don't have that kind of

92
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,090
nodes but we like the range and it also

93
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,180
means that nodes interfering with each

94
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,099
other is not happening with this

95
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:19,728
technology we use unlicensed frequency

96
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,469
bands it means that you don't need a

97
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,940
license or anything you

98
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,520
it's like Wi-Fi you can transmit in

99
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,170
these bands with FCC approved equipment

100
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,300
and I don't know if you if you're a ham

101
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,830
radio operator or you want to know about

102
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,150
the modulation that is being used but

103
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,760
the the chip manufacturer that invented

104
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,710
the lower standard is SEM tech they're

105
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,540
based in California of course that's

106
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,110
where all the smart people live and and

107
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,810
they invented the modulation technology

108
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,010
that basically is allowing a three times

109
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,860
more range than a frequency shift keying

110
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,690
frequency shift keying is that you just

111
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,220
move the frequency of your signal a

112
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,960
little bit and that's how you transfer

113
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,950
data and they they use a chirp a chirp

114
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,560
and I'm trying to explain it but you

115
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,810
know if I'm not doing a good job just

116
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,780
raise your hands and as we to repeat my

117
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,730
story again so a chirp is a a frequency

118
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,750
that goes up so if I do like that's a

119
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,460
chirp like you go from a low frequency

120
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,700
to a high frequency and then what what

121
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,470
you can choose with this technology is

122
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,440
the bandwidth and and the speeds where

123
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,130
you change that chirp so if you want to

124
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,720
change or if you want to Center data

125
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,690
fast then of course you need to do very

126
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,730
fast chirps something like this so you

127
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,350
see that this frequency goes up real

128
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,110
fast but if you want to go long range

129
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,080
then you can do a long chirp and that

130
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,430
means that you get better

131
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,950
signal-to-noise ratio and you can carry

132
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,440
that that signal further but it also

133
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,050
means that your your air time is longer

134
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,130
so you need to make a decision about you

135
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,680
know how do you want to model to set up

136
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,480
your your lower system do you want to do

137
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,910
maximum range or do you want to do

138
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,280
maximum data transfer yes question

139
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,070
you can do anything you want you're in

140
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:32,110
Europe it's mandatory in in the u.s. if

141
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,240
you lose the things network as your

142
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,730
network provider it's a fair use policy

143
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,660
but it's not it's not enforced so if you

144
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,660
want to do well like a typical example

145
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,270
is if you want to to measure how far

146
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,450
your your your range is then what I

147
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,120
typically do is I set up a station to to

148
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,400
send the state a signal every 15 seconds

149
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,070
and I put it on the roof of my car and I

150
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,020
Drive around and I take the signal

151
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,790
strength while I take the GPS location

152
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,100
and I plot that in the cart I'm gonna

153
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,140
show you the results later but that is

154
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,450
something that I can do for now

155
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,990
an hour and then I used up all my 30

156
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,930
seconds but you know nobody's gonna flag

157
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,360
it like oh this guy spent more than 30

158
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,980
seconds but you know there will be

159
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,950
situations where well you get you get

160
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,580
penalized so there are the things

161
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,880
Network has free to use of community

162
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,180
network but companies like Senate laurio

163
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,660
and and short recently also Comcast they

164
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,050
have network services that are paid for

165
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,630
and then you're basically you're paying

166
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,790
for your data so if you're going over

167
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,770
your allotment then suddenly you'll see

168
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,000
that you know the rates go up

169
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,560
yeah

170
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:06,099
yeah let me let me explain you in the

171
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:11,249
next slide I was expecting this question

172
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:14,110
yeah so maybe this explains a little bit

173
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,590
how how the laura1 system is set up so

174
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,520
oh here you see notes and these notes

175
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,529
all communicate to a gateway which is

176
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:28,300
here so in some cases the the the

177
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,360
stations the nodes only can communicate

178
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,909
to this gateway because it's within

179
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,269
range in some cases like this this node

180
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:39,578
here it can communicate to to so its

181
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:41,349
signal is being received by two gateways

182
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,070
at the same time and the software in the

183
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,110
network will decide so it's not that it

184
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,329
will double the network data but you

185
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,399
know it will basically take the first

186
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,230
station that comes in as the dominant

187
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,459
one from the Gateway you go to an online

188
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:00,750
network server and the network server

189
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,000
basically identifies the station so the

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,839
advantage of Laura or Laura when is that

191
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,149
the data is encrypted so although it's

192
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,519
small data and sometimes you can wonder

193
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,640
like is the temperature in my home is

194
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,670
that you know worthwhile the security

195
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,640
measures but Laura is a two-way

196
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,730
communication protocol so why I want I

197
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,480
want I wanted the encryption and the

198
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,519
security of encryption because I want to

199
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,790
be able to operate irrigation valves so

200
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,410
I don't want you guys to start hacking

201
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,089
in my system and start messing with it

202
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:42,160
probably you could if you can decrypt

203
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,570
the 16 bit encryption key but it's it's

204
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,360
basically a basic layer of security that

205
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,800
that is added to it so if you if you see

206
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,420
how this works you need to set up a

207
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,190
station to connect to the network so

208
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,589
there's this I said over-the-air

209
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:05,019
activation protocol that's the first

210
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:08,130
time when the system comes online and it

211
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,930
introduces itself to the network it has

212
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,070
an app

213
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,160
Kinki which basically tells the network

214
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,990
I want to talk with this application and

215
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,340
it also has a security key which is an

216
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,930
encryption key which is shared between

217
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,110
you know the network and the station so

218
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,710
there's a two-way communication one one

219
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,690
is that they're secure communication

220
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,260
between this this node and the network

221
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,210
server and from the network server

222
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,190
because you have an application key

223
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,660
which basically points the network

224
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,600
server to which application server you

225
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,320
want to talk is that is that clear this

226
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,740
that make sense yeah so what what has

227
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,080
been the the the development of Laura so

228
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,730
it started a few years ago so it's not

229
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,750
that old this is the result of three

230
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,540
years of work a company in Amsterdam

231
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,150
started with a wireless solution to

232
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,870
detect water leaks in boats in Amsterdam

233
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,430
they have canals as you probably know

234
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,040
and the Dutch people I'm one of them

235
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,360
they like to to you know use their boat

236
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,430
during the summer but during the winter

237
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,780
it's it's not fun

238
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,900
so we more them and then in spring we we

239
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,210
find that our boats have been floated or

240
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,550
you know half sunk or whatever so

241
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,490
somebody came up with a great idea say

242
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,080
why don't we put water detectors in

243
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,970
these boats and then we use a wireless

244
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,700
network to to connect that to the

245
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,110
Internet and if you know something is

246
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,460
leaking in your boat you get a warning

247
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,310
so that was how did the things network

248
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,790
was born three years ago and they they

249
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,000
basically built ten gateways and with

250
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,710
the ten gateways they covered the whole

251
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,920
city like okay that's pretty cool

252
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,530
and so that that's what they started

253
00:11:59,530 --> 00:11:59,740
with

254
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,470
ten and three years ago now they have

255
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,500
4,000 gateways active all over the world

256
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,330
and you can see the numbers here and you

257
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,820
can also see that it's a at this moment

258
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,950
Europe is is way ahead of everybody else

259
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,860
in it with using this technology we got

260
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,710
like about half of the 4,000 gateways

261
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,510
are in Europe

262
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,410
most of the of course most of the

263
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,769
gateways are in in in the Netherlands

264
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:29,230
but also Switzerland has a very very

265
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,029
dense network infrastructure already

266
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:33,850
then you see it's spreading all over the

267
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,829
world so we can catch up there so what

268
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:40,750
is Los Angeles looking like just you

269
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,060
know to give you an idea so yeah we we

270
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,490
can do something here there's two

271
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,070
communities that are active there's a

272
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,339
community in Marina del Rey so that's

273
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:53,920
the left one somewhere here and then

274
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,920
there is a community in Los Angeles so

275
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,990
if you want to know more about it if you

276
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,300
want to become involved you know there's

277
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,320
if you go to the things Network there's

278
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,240
information about where the location of

279
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,449
all the communities and who the main

280
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:11,440
contact is for that and you can

281
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,079
basically contact them and sign up or or

282
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,910
if you're if you think that you can do

283
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,800
better built or start your own community

284
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,100
because you can do that too so this is

285
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,639
the status of Los Angeles so what do you

286
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,139
need to get started so I bought some

287
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,610
stuff show-and-tell stuff yeah so this

288
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,120
this is a gateway I I experimented with

289
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,399
five different brands and this is the

290
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,399
one that I like best so this one has

291
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,610
been stable and this this is a unit that

292
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,269
actually is for the European frequency

293
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,240
so if I want to test a unit for it for a

294
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,639
European customer and then you can see

295
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,680
here I I didn't put an antenna on by the

296
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,899
dummy load so just for the so it's not

297
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,639
radiating at eight six eight which is

298
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:01,630
illegal here yeah so this is a gateway

299
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,620
and then a soil sensor looks like this

300
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,880
and the good part is I I know I'm

301
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,709
running out of time sorry about yeah I

302
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:15,359
know but I'm gonna run out of time

303
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,580
so if you talk about the the power of

304
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,230
open source and the open source

305
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,930
community this is a good example so this

306
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,270
this soil moisture sensor has been in

307
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,650
the market for about 30 years and I

308
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,090
checked that that company and I asked

309
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,670
them if they would be willing to share

310
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,520
with me the the calibration data of this

311
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,380
this unit and they said no no that's

312
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,350
that's our IP we cannot share that we

313
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,850
build our own equipment I said yeah but

314
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,790
I'm making an open source system and I

315
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,400
would like to use your sensors so no way

316
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,470
and I I tried a couple of times and you

317
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,300
know didn't get anywhere yeah I could

318
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,850
sign an NDA but that would basically

319
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,080
defy the whole purpose of being open

320
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,110
source so last week they they finally

321
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,780
made the calibration data public domain

322
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,540
which is good so we as a community we

323
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,040
put a lot of pressure on these guys

324
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,130
saying hey we can we can do the the

325
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,960
technology better than you you're good

326
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,630
at at sensors and we we acknowledge that

327
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,220
because we are interested in the sensors

328
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,530
but you know your your technology your

329
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,260
wireless and your stuff yeah there's a

330
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,730
there's a whole community out there that

331
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,990
can do a better job than you

332
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,280
so yeah they caved in so that's good so

333
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,280
these sensors connect to a station like

334
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,930
this so this is a little solar panel

335
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,650
that we use to charge the battery and

336
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,050
you can probably see here that there's a

337
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,000
little battery here and you see a little

338
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,810
module with an antenna so this this is

339
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,740
it guys that that's all so with this you

340
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,670
can get like 10 miles

341
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,140
yeah I I'll be happy to pass it along if

342
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,760
people want to see it or if you can come

343
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,470
after after the presentation I'll be

344
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,520
happy to show you but this is a this is

345
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,140
the radio module that you see here and

346
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,860
and what I wanted to show is that when I

347
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,540
started with Laura I was initially

348
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,300
pretty much overwhelmed with all the

349
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,450
data that I got like I asked a supplier

350
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:25,830
of Laura module 4 for data and they sent

351
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,350
me like this Big C library and it was

352
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,270
like kilobytes and kilobytes and said

353
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,090
what do what the heck do I need that for

354
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,130
it's like too much for me I'm not a good

355
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,380
programmer so I I admit it I mean if you

356
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,870
send me 10 pages of C code I'm gonna be

357
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,400
overwhelmed that I just don't know where

358
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,510
to start yeah at the top of course but

359
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,970
so so with this actually this is the

360
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,820
whole setup for the things network and

361
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,160
so it's basically serial data that

362
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,340
you've sent to the module and you send

363
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,600
80 commands so it's basically a cup of

364
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,760
print print commands you send data to

365
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,160
that to that unit and you configure it

366
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,970
for the type of join modes the duty

367
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,010
cycle and then the frequencies you

368
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,290
wanted to work on remember I mentioned

369
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,530
that Europe has eight frequencies for

370
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,459
Laura

371
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,760
the US has 64 and a gateway can support

372
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,670
eight so if you use the sings network

373
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,890
you need to pick eight eight channels

374
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,210
from the 64 and ideally you need to

375
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,910
figure out which ones the things network

376
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,190
is using so you are on the same

377
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,910
frequency as the network I found that

378
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,770
out the hard way to be honest so you

379
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,690
know I couldn't get my system to connect

380
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,730
I could get connect to other suppliers

381
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,250
other network providers I could not

382
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,990
connect to the things network and I did

383
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,350
I tore my head my hairs out and then it

384
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,330
turned out to be like a very simple

385
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,080
basic thing like I was transmitting at

386
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,600
the wrong frequency so who can come up

387
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,130
with that what kind of standard is that

388
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,440
well I found it out and hopefully you

389
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,720
know by sharing this you you won't have

390
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,290
to go through

391
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:22,760
again any questions so far yes sir yeah

392
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:38,380
yes yeah is that is it yeah is it yes

393
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,780
yeah you can build a private network as

394
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,930
well if you want that yes yeah and when

395
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,880
you think about the way it's been set up

396
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,180
you can now also implement your own

397
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,580
network server so one of the cool things

398
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,950
of the things network is that the code

399
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,230
of their network servers is also public

400
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,720
domain so if you want to copy that and

401
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,030
build your own network server you can so

402
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,620
in that sense it's pretty cool but you

403
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,140
know there's only so many things you can

404
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:16,950
do yeah in terms of signal yeah well

405
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,100
it's it's kind of it's kind of hard to

406
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,410
say because it's various country back

407
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,720
country like Mexico for example uses the

408
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,580
same frequencies as the US Australia

409
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:35,920
uses 925 makers and the Europe uses 868

410
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,500
megahertz so you need to look at you

411
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,270
know that the things the things network

412
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,730
but also the Laura standard organization

413
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,490
has a country-by-country a frequency

414
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,720
list and I need to warn you that if you

415
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,960
buy a gateway you need to order it for a

416
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,410
specific frequency range so this Gateway

417
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,950
for example is operating at the European

418
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,080
frequencies only I cannot use it in the

419
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,360
US because it's just limited in

420
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,820
frequency is that answering your

421
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,270
question yeah

422
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,410
yeah and noise is so far I haven't had

423
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,990
problems with noise I have problems with

424
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,620
hills and if there's if there's a hill

425
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,780
in between then it of course the signal

426
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,330
so you need really line-of-sight a free

427
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,000
free free line-of-sight yeah

428
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,150
okay so I'll up if you don't mind I'll

429
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,710
finish unless you have an urgent

430
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,140
question no okay thanks yeah so this is

431
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,870
this is you know a reading I took from

432
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,300
in Temecula so what you what you see

433
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,240
here is to see if I can get the laser to

434
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,740
work yes so this is one gateway here's

435
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,050
another here's another so we got a

436
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,490
couple of them and there are some

437
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,190
gateways here but I'm I haven't met them

438
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,600
yet but what you can see is when I Drive

439
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,580
around in the Temecula area there's

440
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,650
there's Hills but there's also this

441
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,100
there's road over here which is the main

442
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,660
road in Temecula wine country all the

443
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,550
major wineries are there and you see

444
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,710
that we have near continuous coverage

445
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,920
there so anywhere I place a gateway or a

446
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,380
station in any of these areas it's all

447
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,570
connect to any of these these gateways

448
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,850
and and often it will connect to

449
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,700
multiple of them so if one gateway you

450
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,880
know loses loses power or anything you

451
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,560
know the others take over so overlapping

452
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,970
coverage is actually a good thing here

453
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,290
the the the gateways with the best range

454
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,280
the gateways with the best range

455
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,680
actually have an external antenna on the

456
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,620
roof so if you use the internal antenna

457
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,150
that comes with the little rubber

458
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,010
antenna that comes with that that

459
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,770
gateway and use it indoors you can get a

460
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,280
mile because you know just just the

461
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,460
house attenuates the signal if you

462
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,110
really want to get good range you need

463
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,820
to be on the roof with an external

464
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,580
antenna and keep the antenna cable short

465
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,920
because at 900 megahertz you know a

466
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,320
cable attenuates as well so you want to

467
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,260
keep it short so what I typically do is

468
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,240
put the Gateway in a water water tight

469
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,280
enclosure on the roof as well and then

470
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,530
with power over ethernet power it and

471
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:31,130
and get the signal in so use-case

472
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,130
agriculture of course in my case there's

473
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,930
other use cases that you can think of

474
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,650
but this is what what I use so we have a

475
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,440
sensor stations in a vineyard and they

476
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,510
measure temperature they measure soil

477
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,370
moisture using the sensors that I just

478
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,430
showed and they sent that data to a

479
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,330
gateway over here so from the Gateway

480
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,240
you need to go to an internet router I

481
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,660
use Wi-Fi or Internet and from the

482
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,980
internet router you get on the internet

483
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,890
and there's a cloud-based application so

484
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,680
we work with a partner in Europe that

485
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,990
made a specific applications for

486
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,920
vineyards but now also for orchards and

487
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,080
from that application you can you can

488
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,800
look at your data and you can decide

489
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,720
depending on the soil moisture status

490
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,060
and the weather data how long you want

491
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,160
to irrigate every day so the computer

492
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,190
basically uses Laura when also to

493
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,830
wirelessly activate irrigation valves

494
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,120
so this is an example of an orchard that

495
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,320
we where we installed systems in in

496
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,800
Bakersfield and it was we install it mid

497
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,560
mid April this year so it's a 13 acre

498
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,420
it's a 13 acre orchard the 23rd leaf is

499
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,550
farmer speak for telling you that the

500
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,940
for the trees are 22 years old so you

501
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,300
know don't get don't get impressed by

502
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,300
that and then the the spacing is such

503
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,800
that you get 308 trees per acre so

504
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,720
depending on the season and how hot the

505
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,110
weather is each tree takes about twenty

506
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,540
to sixty five gallons sometimes even

507
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,540
more water per day so you can imagine

508
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,120
that you know a vineyard like that or an

509
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,650
orchard like that takes a lot of water

510
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:34,290
and when we install this we noticed that

511
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,880
the moisture in the soil was actually

512
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,190
pretty high so you know to explain this

513
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,490
scale the zero is wet and the higher the

514
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,890
number the drier it is so typically you

515
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,510
don't want to be higher than sixty and

516
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,910
you cannot be wetter than wet

517
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,050
you cannot go negative on on this scale

518
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,420
yeah so what you see here is we

519
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,280
installed it and we said hey this looks

520
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,440
pretty wet and then the farmer said yeah

521
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,600
but I still need to do the the

522
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,090
fertigation which is applying fertilizer

523
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,480
to the trees using the irrigation system

524
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,870
so you see a little dip here and that

525
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,490
means that the soil is actually getting

526
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,140
wetter it was already wet but it was

527
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,750
even get made worse because the farmer

528
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,700
and you can see that same dip here the

529
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,040
farmer needed to apply fertilizer and

530
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,560
that's the pre bloom fertilizer as they

531
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,360
call it and it's a mix of all kind of

532
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,600
stuff and they never tell what it is

533
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,610
because it's their secret for growing

534
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,700
growing pistachios but after that we

535
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,040
which I was still wet what do we do now

536
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,160
so we we got in touch with

537
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,910
you see a n R which is the agricultural

538
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,760
natural resources group within the UC

539
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,550
system and they have irrigation experts

540
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,830
that help farmers so we asked them what

541
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,020
do we do with this and he said well you

542
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,180
know stop irrigating and then wait till

543
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:00,610
the the sensor at two feet hits 60 so

544
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,800
okay we waited we waited with so we

545
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,980
waited a month so that that that is the

546
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,470
equivalent of eight eight Olympic

547
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,780
swimming pools and water and just on the

548
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:16,450
13 acre yeah question sir okay that's a

549
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,480
good question so in the in vineyards

550
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,160
they typically used rippers like dripper

551
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,060
hoses that you punch in a drippers with

552
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,450
these these trees they use a little

553
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,690
sprayer so they spray like 3/4 of a

554
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,260
radius and they spray in the area where

555
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,760
the root system is so the roots are

556
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,150
pretty shallow and they use a two

557
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,970
drippers of six gallons per hour so per

558
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,130
hour they basically irrigate 12 12

559
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,140
gallons so you can imagine if you want

560
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,480
to irrigate 65 gallons that's you know

561
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,290
you need to irrigate a long time is it

562
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,670
answering your question okay

563
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,080
so with that this is this is basically

564
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,809
by now you know second nearly the last

565
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:10,260
slide so it's a free network it's free

566
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,200
to use and I encourage everybody to if

567
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,600
you are within range of such a network

568
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,990
use it because it's free and it's it's

569
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,620
fun to work with it if you if you don't

570
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,300
have a network you know please consider

571
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,640
if that's you know within what you want

572
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,280
to do consider you know putting up a

573
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,320
gateway and shared with with everybody

574
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,970
in your neighborhood start a community

575
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,800
start developing you know other

576
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,770
applications a lot of applications are

577
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,440
things that you know require long

578
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,300
distance so it's different than Wi-Fi is

579
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,220
different than Bluetooth of course it

580
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,590
has its own typical application but you

581
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,530
can imagine like there was there was an

582
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,330
application where they have mousetraps

583
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,150
so you know they use this technology to

584
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:57,179
see if you caught a mouse so you don't

585
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,340
and and for some companies that do like

586
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,260
a test control that's actually a time

587
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,510
saver because they don't need to run all

588
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,610
these traps or check these these traps

589
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,620
in the building they just you know look

590
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,809
on the on the internet whether they need

591
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:12,210
to check on them trap and then you know

592
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,740
I talked about the boats you know a

593
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,980
water detection irrigation of course but

594
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,020
there are so much more and that's the

595
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,300
part of you know an open open source

596
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,460
community you know together we can come

597
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,080
up with applications that you know

598
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,260
nobody thought of before so there are

599
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,510
two communities here in the area one in

600
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,900
Marina del Rey one in LA you're free to

601
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,850
start your own community the things

602
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,710
network will support you

603
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,470
there's also another thing there was a

604
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,480
big conference in Amsterdam for the

605
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,600
first time and it was a huge success

606
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,190
they held that conference in Amsterdam

607
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,309
in February and although I'm Dutch and I

608
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:53,250
like to visit my family February is not

609
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,980
a good time of year to visit and it's

610
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,160
cold it's nasty and I I I didn't like it

611
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,510
and by the way it was my birthday and I

612
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,550
had to celebrate in Amsterdam who could

613
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,320
think of something worse

614
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,220
but they they basically floated this

615
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,470
idea of having the conference on tour

616
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,779
but this is a major commitment so you

617
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:17,629
know unless unless a lot of people want

618
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:20,960
to chip in and join I think it's a good

619
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,369
idea to think about can we do with

620
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:24,559
things conference in LA or Southern

621
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,570
California just to get you know things

622
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,029
started here they will support it but it

623
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:30,619
takes a lot of commitment and a lot of

624
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:33,070
effort to make a professional conference

625
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,889
so I'll put a question mark here but you

626
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:38,239
know if you want to be personally

627
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:41,149
involved there's communities there's a

628
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:44,779
lot of open source software and I saw

629
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:48,169
this this on Amazon last week which was

630
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:50,859
kind of cool this is a device that has a

631
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:54,200
a micro controller it has bluetooth it

632
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,570
has Wi-Fi it has Laura and it has a

633
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,289
little display and it's 26 bucks and and

634
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:01,970
and there were people that already said

635
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,710
that yeah we you know they gave it five

636
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,119
stars like we could connect to the

637
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,059
things network how cool can that be so

638
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:09,619
you know it's easy to get started as

639
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:12,919
long as you have a gateway and you know

640
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:15,169
this is just to finish it off this is

641
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:16,669
just a picture that I took of one of the

642
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:18,049
gateways that we installed on the roof

643
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,879
so you see that the antenna is really

644
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:22,729
tiny and you know this is the box where

645
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:24,739
you put that gateway in so it's it's

646
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,499
protected from the weather in the Sun so

647
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:30,679
with that I I want to show you a one

648
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,080
last slide and this is just useful links

649
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,710
so if you want to know more look at the

650
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,509
links first you know read the manual and

651
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:40,479
then call me if you have more questions

652
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:43,639
all right we have time for questions

653
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:47,949
yeah yes sir

654
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:53,789
yes it's a very good question so Laura

655
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:57,119
is the modulation is the the lower layer

656
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:02,309
of the protocol if you use that then you

657
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:04,859
can get a point-to-point connection

658
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:06,959
where you make a wireless UART so you

659
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:09,479
put data in one module and you get data

660
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:12,299
out of the other module the same data so

661
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:16,039
it's like a cable but then without wires

662
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:19,409
so that's Laura when our Laura land and

663
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:21,749
then Laura when users like the the

664
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:23,489
encryption and you knew you need to use

665
00:31:23,489 --> 00:31:26,099
the server's so it's more complicated so

666
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:28,259
if you want to start developing using a

667
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:30,419
wireless technology it's actually easier

668
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,609
to start with Laura land because you

669
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:34,859
don't have all the complexity of logging

670
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,739
into the network and applying for for an

671
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:41,579
account so it's easier but if you really

672
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:43,139
want to go to the next level and I've

673
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:45,329
gone through that process you know I

674
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:47,999
want to control I want to control valves

675
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:50,699
I want to be able to control have

676
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:52,859
multiple stations work at the same time

677
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:55,559
and with Laurel and I found that if two

678
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,239
stations are transmitting at the same

679
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:59,359
time they interfere with each other and

680
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,249
Laura when has taken care of it I was

681
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:04,349
thinking like should I find it should I

682
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:05,849
reinvent the wheel well there is a

683
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:07,499
standard that already takes care of it

684
00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:10,219
so that's that's

685
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:16,610
oh yeah so that yes so the the reason

686
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,720
why I asked what would the difference

687
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,789
between Laura and Laura one yeah was

688
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:21,140
because I actually have a customer

689
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,429
that's interested in using the Laura

690
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:24,320
technology but I couldn't understand the

691
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,779
difference between using Laura which i

692
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:27,770
think is what they want because they

693
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,630
want point-to-point communication yeah

694
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,429
versus having the higher level protocol

695
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:33,169
for actually establishing a network

696
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,899
which is I think what makes it nice but

697
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:38,299
that's a different standard yes is more

698
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:40,429
of a to support multiple endpoints

699
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:42,320
correct okay thank you

700
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,130
there was a question oh yeah let me okay

701
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,059
a little easier so everybody came here

702
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:53,450
here in Southern California grass fires

703
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,159
are kind of like water and boats in

704
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:56,929
Amsterdam you know it happens all the

705
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:58,520
time I'd like to know about it when it

706
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,890
happens if anybody in the room is

707
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,559
interested in talking a little bit about

708
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,750
using this technology with horizon

709
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,510
scanners which I build such that if you

710
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,090
get one which has a saturated infrared

711
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,510
signal you know the direction and you

712
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,490
know the intensity and then you trip it

713
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,490
up come and see me thank you

714
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,789
yeah there was actually a lot of use for

715
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:26,029
that I yeah you know I noticed that this

716
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:28,309
year especially in Temecula and that

717
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:29,779
area you know we had a couple of

718
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:32,840
wildfires and I've seen the the planes

719
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,600
fly over my home and so yeah it's

720
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,610
getting closer to close to comfort to be

721
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,380
honest yeah so I I appreciate the

722
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,690
initiative thank you another question

723
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,289
okay yeah

724
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,940
I'm wondering about the liquid sensors

725
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,620
basically to use battery power for more

726
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,630
you figure out a way to power them with

727
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,170
some local power supply I only use

728
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,990
battery power at the moment okay and the

729
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,050
way the way I achieved it because if you

730
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:07,190
use a an Arduino out-of-the-box it takes

731
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,719
like 19 milliamps at 5 volt and then I

732
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,690
use the Arduino Pro Mini which is using

733
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:19,310
8 8 milliamps so I found a sketch call

734
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,510
from our library from a company called

735
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,960
rocket screen rocket screen so it allows

736
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,870
you to bring the whole system down to a

737
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,929
very minimum power state it doesn't

738
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,520
operate but you can wake it up with an

739
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,520
interrupt pin or on a timer and it

740
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,280
basically reduces the the currents

741
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,489
dramatically you need to remove the LED

742
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,620
though because the LED takes about 1

743
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,260
million but we got we got now without

744
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,940
any other modifications and the rocker

745
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,820
screen we got from 8 milliamps to point

746
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,879
5 point 6 milliamps and then if we

747
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,550
remove some LG O's and other stuff we

748
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,590
get to 60 microns so

749
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:06,099
I use two types of batteries so in this

750
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:09,309
case I use a rechargeable lithium ion

751
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:12,249
battery which is 900 milliamps hour and

752
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:16,499
then in the case of using a battery only

753
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:19,239
we use a nine thousand milliamp hour

754
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:22,630
lithium battery which is a a Type B form

755
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,420
factor there are about eight dollars and

756
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,539
they can run at 60 million a 60 my crams

757
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:32,470
you can run for ten years that's pretty

758
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,690
good yeah well the thing is like that's

759
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,940
the theory right like I hope that that

760
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,539
battery provides that bed that capacity

761
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,130
over ten years but that's you know what

762
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,440
it says according to the specs so yeah

763
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,420
well talk we'll come back in ten years

764
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,789
and not you any other questions

765
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:54,369
alright so for you feel free to welcome

766
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:55,900
a free thrill to see me after the

767
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,609
presentation or if you have questions or

768
00:35:57,609 --> 00:35:59,799
send me an email call me whatever thank

769
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:00,830
you thank you so much

770
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:07,590
[Applause]
