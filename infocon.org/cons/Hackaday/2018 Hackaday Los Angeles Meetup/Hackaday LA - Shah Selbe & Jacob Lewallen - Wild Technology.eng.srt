1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
I'm sha Shelby and I'm going to tell you

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,970
about a little bit of the work that we

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,060
do with in the field of conservation

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,040
technology so I you know I'm I

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,380
Jacobs gonna talk as well we're two

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,000
parts of conserva Phi which is an

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,060
organization I'll tell you about shortly

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,580
but I I came into this work originally

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,920
my background is Satellite engineering

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,289
so I worked at Boeing doing spacecraft

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,380
propulsion systems I'm now a fellow at

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,420
the National Geographic Society helping

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,630
to think through how technology and

14
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,920
conservation come together to protect

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,879
the planet so so conservation technology

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,460
you know when many people think about

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,020
engineers they don't really think about

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,469
this image behind me this is this is us

19
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,180
in the middle of an expedition that

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,090
we're on in the northern part of

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,579
Botswana in the Okavango Delta which

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,500
I'll tell you a small story about a

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,949
little bit later but we were where we go

24
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,780
across this Delta and boats and at this

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,370
point the water was low enough that we

26
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,438
actually had to strap up and and drag

27
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:05,700
the boats through the water like we were

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,450
oxen and being an engineer in that place

29
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,439
I have a very peculiar set of coworkers

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,259
this is one of the co-workers that we

31
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,330
passed by this Nile crocodile this is

32
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,070
actually a small one we we passed over

33
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,650
Nile crocodiles that were you know 17 18

34
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,640
feet long so big big animals and these

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,229
are the this is the environment that we

36
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,540
have to that we have to build the stuff

37
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,549
we build in so here you know we're

38
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,380
standing in water shortly after this

39
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,540
picture I actually that year I set the

40
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,720
expedition record for most leeches on me

41
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,640
at once which was which was nine and and

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,579
as you would assume doing any kind of

43
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,170
technology work in those sorts of places

44
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,030
you have to carry a lot of gear

45
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,640
everywhere you go because you you you

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,380
can't quite anticipate what you're gonna

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,060
encounter when you're out there and you

48
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,100
learn things while you're out in the

49
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,960
field like one thing that I learned in

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,649
2015 is hyenas like LED lights so

51
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,840
they'll chew on anything that has an LED

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,800
light so conservation technology it's

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,020
kind of a new

54
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,240
that's that's quite popular now in the

55
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,940
conservation and field science world and

56
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,250
it really comes as a result of where we

57
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,960
are from a technology standpoint so I

58
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,270
you know this is definitely an audience

59
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,710
that I don't have to explain this side

60
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,570
of things to but we've come a long way

61
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,070
in a very short time and we could do a

62
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,890
lot of really amazing things now for

63
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,650
much cheaper than before but on the

64
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,210
other side of things you know while

65
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,590
we've gone through this massive

66
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,840
technological ascent from an

67
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,490
environmental and a conservation

68
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,200
standpoint where we're actually in a

69
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,480
pretty big crisis so things like

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,400
overfishing and poaching or running

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,850
rampant across the world the the

72
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,100
extinction rate of animals nowadays is a

73
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,130
thousand times greater than what we

74
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,840
would consider the baseline extinction

75
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,180
rate so so you know the animals are

76
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,430
dying off quickly and that's happened in

77
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,170
Earth's history multiple times before

78
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,480
right you can talk to any grade school

79
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,950
kid and they'll tell you about dinosaurs

80
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,470
or the Ice Age but this is the first

81
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,780
time that it's actually happened as a

82
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,540
result of a single species driving it

83
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,330
does anyone want to guess what species

84
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,470
that is that's driving it it's yeah it's

85
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,660
people right we're driving that

86
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,580
extinction rate quite bad so so we have

87
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,890
a lab not too far away from here in

88
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,190
downtown LA called conserva Phi where we

89
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,920
we build open source technology tools

90
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,660
for scientists out in the field or

91
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,790
conservation organizations that want to

92
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,830
better understand what's happening to

93
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,420
the planet monitor what's happening to

94
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,430
the planet and and share that with the

95
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,250
world so you know we we have everything

96
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,540
that you would expect to have in that

97
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,490
sort of lab you know laser cutters 3d

98
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,190
printers reflow stuff everything but it

99
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,050
really allows us to build these tools

100
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,380
that actually vary quite drastically

101
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,420
from one project to the next or one

102
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,970
organization we work on to the next so

103
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,500
just generally in the field of

104
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,390
conservation technology everything you

105
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,310
can think of like all these tech

106
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,590
buzzwords that you you read about on the

107
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,600
internet or you see on Twitter there's

108
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,459
people who are trying to shape this kind

109
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,950
of technology now to to solve some of

110
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,720
these massive conservation challenges

111
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,610
we're doing some of this stuff

112
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,349
links of ours are doing doing other

113
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,360
things so I'll tell you some of the

114
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,099
stuff that we're doing some of the

115
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:33,400
current projects that we have right now

116
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,219
one one thing that biologists a lot want

117
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,949
to know is where animals go or where

118
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,689
where they go as a result of human

119
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,610
activity where they go in different

120
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,319
parts of their life cycles and all sorts

121
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,389
of stuff so so tracking animals has been

122
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:48,680
something that's been quite popular for

123
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,259
a while but a GPS tracker that you you

124
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,969
want to put on an animal if you buy from

125
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:55,099
one of the providers you know the the

126
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:57,889
proprietary providers that exist now is

127
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:02,360
like you know three for ten thousand

128
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,250
dollars for a GPS tracker on a single

129
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,020
animal and I you know I don't have to

130
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,360
tell the crowd here for a device that's

131
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,960
basically a microcontroller and a GPS

132
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,789
sometimes a radio on it charging ten

133
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:16,490
thousand dollars is absolutely absurd so

134
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,259
there's a few of us that have been

135
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:20,180
developing open source tags that we can

136
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,250
use on animals and so at conservative

137
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,750
high we're deploying it in two places

138
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,699
this year we're gonna be going to Belize

139
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:29,270
to tag sharks in the reef system that

140
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,529
they have out there and then we're also

141
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:33,169
going to be going to Antarctica to tag

142
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,569
sperm whales with some of these these

143
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,860
open source trackers that we do we use

144
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,110
another project that we have is called

145
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,870
undersea connection so I you some of you

146
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,219
guys may have heard of rainforest

147
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:47,779
connection this is a an organization

148
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,699
that a colleague of mine started and

149
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,469
actually had a pretty successful

150
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:54,469
Kickstarter campaign his idea was his

151
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:56,089
name's Topher white his idea was you

152
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,069
could take old cell phones that people

153
00:05:58,069 --> 00:05:58,909
don't want anymore

154
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,219
and you put a nice microphone on it and

155
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:02,930
you write some software and you put it

156
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,089
up in the rain forest and you can you

157
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:06,919
can basically have those cell phones

158
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,610
listen for logging activity or like

159
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,409
motorcycles and stuff in the rain forest

160
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:15,529
and the the thought was if you do that

161
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,599
then you could start to catch people who

162
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,669
are illegally logging in parts of the

163
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:20,750
rainforest where you're not supposed to

164
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,250
be doing that sort of stuff and actually

165
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,289
the first time Topher went and deployed

166
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:26,000
one of these systems they put it up and

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,800
he found someone who is illegal log

168
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,330
illegally logging right around the

169
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,819
corner so so it's something that they've

170
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:33,919
shown that's worked we actually have a

171
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,389
collaboration with them where we're

172
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:37,729
taking that same technology it's moved

173
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:38,780
beyond the phone

174
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,720
now into their own boards and we put it

175
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,270
in the oceans in marine protected areas

176
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,160
so these are basically underwater parks

177
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,870
in different parts of the world where

178
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,040
we're trying to protect them we're

179
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,290
saying this is a special place we're

180
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,190
gonna let the ant

181
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,330
you know the fish that live in this

182
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,910
place grow and then anything else that

183
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,590
spills out then like fishermen and

184
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,150
everyone can can kind of take advantage

185
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,580
of that but these are special parks so

186
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,320
we're putting these things in MPAs with

187
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,210
these marine protected areas to be able

188
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,950
to listen for vessel traffic as they

189
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,360
come through and we have a prototype

190
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,700
that's in the port of LA right now and

191
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,440
we're scaling that up and deploying it

192
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,960
in lots of places later on this year and

193
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,910
you could tell a lot acoustically you

194
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,590
could tell what kind of vessel it is you

195
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,940
could tell what kind of fishing activity

196
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,040
they're doing you could tell if you know

197
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,410
if the the reef system is is a healthy

198
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,330
reef system or if it's a if it's a dying

199
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,580
reef system it's a lot of information

200
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,960
that you can actually get from that sort

201
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,310
of thing

202
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,440
another project that we had work done is

203
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,990
with NOAA which is you know the National

204
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,940
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

205
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,760
on creating a low-cost tool to track

206
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,340
ocean health it's called a CTD a test it

207
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,340
does conductivity temperature and depth

208
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,020
profile so we created a low-cost

209
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,360
open-source one and a lot of the work

210
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,700
that we do also involves drones so you

211
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,680
guys have heard a lot about drones and

212
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,150
the changes that's happened to drones I

213
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,640
actually just came back from the

214
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,850
Republic of Congo on a drone project

215
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,990
which I'll tell you a little bit about

216
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,000
right now so in in Congo the type of

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,590
guerilla that they have there is the

218
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,169
western lowland gorilla it there's

219
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:13,820
actually quite a bit of western lowland

220
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,840
gorillas and they're a little bit

221
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,130
smaller than the mountain gorillas that

222
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,510
a lot of people think about when they go

223
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,360
to places like varun to go see those

224
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,830
animals but the crazy thing about

225
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,570
western lowland gorillas there's still

226
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,729
big animals as they climb up trees so

227
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:27,110
this picture was actually taken it was

228
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,340
maybe 90 to 100 feet up in a tree as

229
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,440
it's there and so we're partnering with

230
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,539
a researcher there who's actually

231
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,849
probably the world's leading expert on

232
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,159
western lowland gorillas and what she's

233
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,940
studying is his girl of behavior so this

234
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,040
population of gorillas they actually

235
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,510
have this very unique behavior where

236
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,190
they go to this very specific type of

237
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,530
tree they dig really deep and they eat

238
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,089
us

239
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:53,829
special part of the route that's on that

240
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:56,499
tree and the reason why that's

241
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:57,819
interesting is that's not a natural

242
00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:00,339
gorilla behavior it's something that one

243
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,170
group of gorillas learned how to do and

244
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,149
has subsequently topped two other groups

245
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:06,910
of gorillas so they show she's very

246
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,199
interested in and the way that they

247
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,850
study it now is they use camera traps

248
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,199
they put camera traps in these sorts of

249
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:13,870
places but they don't know where they

250
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,569
should put those traps so we came in and

251
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:18,069
we did a whole bunch of drone mapping in

252
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:19,779
that whole area to try and find more of

253
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:22,149
those trees and model that part of the

254
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:24,249
rainforest so that they can know exactly

255
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:26,800
where those traps are so I was there I

256
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,410
got back on on the Sunday before last

257
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,809
from doing that and then we tested other

258
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,370
kinds of radio technologies and other

259
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,410
stuff so that we could put sensors and

260
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,910
connected camera traps throughout those

261
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,470
places so they don't actually have to

262
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,850
hike out to all the places that they

263
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,079
need to go but the next project I'll

264
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:46,029
tell you about is the one that I

265
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:48,040
mentioned at the start that happened in

266
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,749
Botswana and the reason why I wanted to

267
00:09:49,749 --> 00:09:50,889
tell you about this is because this

268
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:54,100
project actually influenced a big a big

269
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,339
initiative that we have a conservative I

270
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,600
that project was called the Okavango

271
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,819
wilderness project it's actually an

272
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:02,559
official initiative at National

273
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,259
Geographic right now where they go year

274
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:07,540
after year to this place to try and

275
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,550
protect the Okavango Delta

276
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,910
so the Okavango Delta if you haven't

277
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,490
heard of it is this magical place that's

278
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,019
in northern Botswana it's actually a

279
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,740
series of rivers that flows into the

280
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,569
middle of the Kalahari Desert into a

281
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:25,059
giant inland Delta that basically just

282
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:28,089
flows into the desert and evaporates but

283
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:30,610
it creates this amazing habitat for all

284
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,769
like that charismatic megafauna that you

285
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:33,689
think about when you think about

286
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:35,529
sub-saharan Africa it's actually the

287
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:37,720
healthiest population of African

288
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,639
elephants in the world there's 300,000

289
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,839
of them there but like hippos and and

290
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,879
and lions and and crocodiles and

291
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,199
everything that you would you would

292
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:48,550
think about when you're there it's it's

293
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,550
a really remarkable place and the reason

294
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,429
why they wanted to protect that area was

295
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:57,040
because the headwaters of the Delta what

296
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,050
all the water comes from Angola and I

297
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,009
don't know how much you know about

298
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,929
Angola but it's a place that went

299
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,690
through 27 years of civil war it's

300
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,490
most landmine country in the world and

301
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,740
now it's the second largest oil producer

302
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,140
in Africa so they're really changing a

303
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,180
lot of stuff and and if you're if you're

304
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,880
mining if you're prospecting for oil all

305
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,790
that stuff requires water which could

306
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,130
fundamentally change one of the most

307
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,370
special parts of this planet so we came

308
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,160
in to better understand what the current

309
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,810
state is and how those things can happen

310
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,690
over time you know we we the first time

311
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,490
we did it we did how how scientists

312
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,260
traditionally do it where we pulled

313
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,110
water out and we actually ran tests on

314
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,540
the water chemistry there and then we we

315
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,250
started developing our own tools that

316
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,170
would allow us to do that autonomously

317
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,780
and and set up these these networks of

318
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,560
sensors throughout the area but kind of

319
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,050
at its core what the Okavango wilderness

320
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,480
project was is a wildlife census they

321
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,820
the the scientists were going year after

322
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,860
year through this really special place

323
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,750
and they're counting wildlife they're

324
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,640
counting the number of birds they see

325
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,680
the number of elephants they see all the

326
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,260
sort of stuff as a means of doing kind

327
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,260
of a annual census on that area this is

328
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,660
like a key tool of biologists when

329
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,880
they're out in the field but when we

330
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,160
came into it they were just doing it by

331
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,750
writing it down in a notebook you know

332
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,370
and then they would come back and

333
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,200
someone would have the really horrible

334
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,910
job of taking all that and putting it in

335
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,770
an Excel spreadsheet and that would sit

336
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,170
on somebody's computer and you know no

337
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,190
one would ever see the data

338
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,810
nothing ever would happen at it so we

339
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,100
said all right you know what like

340
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,740
everything you're doing is important we

341
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,870
can take all of that data that you

342
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,210
collect and we can do something cool

343
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,890
with it so we decided that we wanted to

344
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,860
actually take it all and and make it

345
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,650
open and make it live so the way that

346
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,839
the Delta the the into the Okavango

347
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,720
project worked was we built this website

348
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,000
called in to the Okavango org that all

349
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,790
the data while you we were on expedition

350
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,650
all the sightings all the water quality

351
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,500
data the pictures we took the heartbeats

352
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,390
of the researchers literally everything

353
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,310
that we collected would would be

354
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,589
streamed up through satellite and come

355
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:10,660
up live on this website so you if we

356
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,890
were on expedition you'd go to this

357
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,030
website I'm one of these sorry I'm one

358
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,530
of these s's that you see here the

359
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,430
bubbles there

360
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,990
and that's like where we were at that

361
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,850
exact moment as we're going through this

362
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,430
expedition and and we we built the tool

363
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,010
to be completely open so anybody could

364
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,720
take that data and do anything that they

365
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,010
wanted with it

366
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,560
and that included all the sensor data

367
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,450
that we had we had sensors attached to

368
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,220
the boats that we went down so we got a

369
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,160
water quality profile and and 360

370
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,730
pictures of the entire way and

371
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,959
everything that we collected was all

372
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,230
correlated using GPS and sorry was using

373
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,240
GPS and time yeah we did we did 360

374
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,680
pictures as well so like you could put a

375
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,200
but you could put on a pair of VR

376
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,640
goggles and basically live through the

377
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,970
entire expedition as as we went through

378
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,589
and and you could see on the on the

379
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:04,209
website the way that we had all these

380
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:07,450
little orbs are the actual 360 photos as

381
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,160
we're going through but the interesting

382
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,740
thing was now we had data in a way that

383
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,029
they didn't have it before before they

384
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:14,440
just had some things I wrote down in a

385
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,200
notebook now we had pictures and sounds

386
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,540
and and water quality data and animal

387
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,600
sightings that was all tied to time in

388
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,110
GPS so you can actually start to see

389
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,730
trends and and really interesting data

390
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,230
that would come out of that sort of

391
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,420
stuff that you that you didn't see

392
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,700
before and we've heard all sorts of

393
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,950
students and and universities and other

394
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,390
groups that have gone off and taken that

395
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,339
data and done pretty pretty cool things

396
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:42,040
with it but the other thing that we did

397
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,740
while we were on expedition was we tried

398
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,350
to we tried to really engage with the

399
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,750
public so you know we we leverage social

400
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,720
media all the tweets and everything that

401
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,300
we we would send would would show up on

402
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,570
the map as well and so a great example

403
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,890
of how we kind of reached out while

404
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,250
we're while we were there was in the

405
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,170
2015 expedition we're in a part of

406
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,459
Angola that was very difficult there was

407
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,720
there was sweat bees everywhere which

408
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,940
are these like really small like fly

409
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,040
like animals that you'll have literally

410
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,600
like four hundred of them around your

411
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,459
head at one time and they're trying to

412
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,230
get in your eyes and your ears though

413
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,570
the water was was really shallow though

414
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,630
the river was really was really bendy

415
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,850
the weather was bad and and so in the

416
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,389
interest of sharing everything

417
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,329
we complained about it on Twitter and so

418
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:36,180
one of our followers actually saw us

419
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,730
complaining while we were on expedition

420
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,209
and tweeted us back a message of support

421
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,980
that follower was Samantha Christopher

422
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,949
Eddie which was a European Space Agency

423
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:49,319
astronaut that was on the International

424
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:52,680
Space Station at the time and she took a

425
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,990
picture of the Delta and tweeted us down

426
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,230
this message of support you know which I

427
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,550
think you can imagine kind of like

428
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,800
raised everybody's spirits quite a bit

429
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,649
so it was pretty cool so we we that

430
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,360
whole experience was pretty profound in

431
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,670
terms of of the impact that it had and

432
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,949
in the outreach that we had so we wanted

433
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,110
to take that and turn it into something

434
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,939
that anybody could do the exact same

435
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:19,980
thing so Jacob will come up and talk

436
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,440
about that think shell

437
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,200
[Applause]

438
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,170
so my name is Jacob blonde I am the

439
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,210
other half of consumer fire

440
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,790
it's its primary nerd so to speak and

441
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,810
I'm gonna talk to you about fill kit

442
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,810
which is basically what we we spend most

443
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,160
of our time working on nowadays when

444
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,990
we're not doing some of these other side

445
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,510
projects and I kind of think and I'm

446
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,120
gonna take a quick moment to give a

447
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,290
shout out some of the people that have

448
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,640
helped us along the way to get to the

449
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,280
point we're at now because this has been

450
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,750
very much a collaborative effort we have

451
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,970
a lot of volunteers people that have

452
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,670
spent quite a bit of time you know just

453
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,650
helping us out and some of them right

454
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,040
now just uh you know fairness so what

455
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,859
does feel kit I apologize for the market

456
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,260
speak a little bit right here but silk

457
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,020
it is it's a one clip open ecosystem for

458
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,550
researchers and explorers in communities

459
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,430
and a lot of what Shaw was talking about

460
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,920
with regard to you know Twitter and data

461
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,699
has you know feeds into this process and

462
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,730
this work we're doing with ok right now

463
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,430
and its global its distributed and its

464
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,110
primary focus is environmental data but

465
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,160
there's this there's you know there's

466
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,870
more to it than just you know the

467
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,760
science and the numbers and that kind of

468
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,790
thing and I'm gonna start a little high

469
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,350
altitude and then sort of drill down and

470
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,000
the different parts because it's it's a

471
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,340
little bit of a big undertaking and

472
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,930
there's a few sort of principles that

473
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,120
we're trying to to keep in mind as we

474
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,320
work on this

475
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,350
it's got to be approachable not

476
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,600
everybody that is there's going to be

477
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,430
interested in this kind of this kind of

478
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,900
thing is gonna have the technical

479
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,850
know-how to build and design PCBs and

480
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,530
assemble it and that kind of thing so

481
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,210
it's got to be it's got to be really

482
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,550
approachable easy to use but it's also

483
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,140
got to have you know be research grade

484
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,460
so it's got to be something that people

485
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,380
know the kind of dating they're getting

486
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,700
the data they're getting out of it is

487
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,610
you know has these sort of you know this

488
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,670
error and that kind of thing and it's

489
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,100
open source and extensible and free it's

490
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,240
a really big part of what we do so

491
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,950
everything you're about to see with

492
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,600
regard to field kit is it's on github

493
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,850
there's repositories for it you can go

494
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,520
and clone repositories run the code you

495
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,710
can send board send away for boards from

496
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,810
March Park and you know assemble

497
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,920
yourself in your living room it's fine

498
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,680
field kit is it's a platform so it's a

499
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,700
lot of different

500
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,260
pieces well three pieces it's not a lot

501
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,080
of pieces the first being its modular

502
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,149
hardware which I'm gonna get to in a

503
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:50,130
little bit and there's an app and

504
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,159
there's a website the app kind of ties

505
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,730
the hardware and the website together

506
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,830
but the the websites a little bit more

507
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,419
than a web site just with a bunch of

508
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,190
numbers in it the app is a little bit

509
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,870
more than just something that moves data

510
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,350
from the hardware to the website and the

511
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,210
hardware is it's just hardware but it's

512
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,010
also nice because it is a platform it's

513
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,809
a place where people can can augment and

514
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,399
add their own hardware which will we'll

515
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:18,480
get to in a little bit Shaw talked a lot

516
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,539
about Twitter and sort of the engagement

517
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,580
you get from combining just the science

518
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,529
you know things heartbeat on expedition

519
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:27,240
and the water quality and that kind of

520
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,490
thing and our goal with field kit is to

521
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,889
be able to take these multiple inputs of

522
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:33,510
information whether it be social media

523
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,470
or raw sensor data sitting in a riverbed

524
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,960
somewhere and combined in aggregate in a

525
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,090
way and display it whether it be on our

526
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,429
website or some other source or you know

527
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:47,399
destination we have I naturist up here

528
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:49,980
and that's on a future slide where this

529
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,210
data in this information doesn't

530
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,429
necessarily have to go to to this Web

531
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:54,779
site that we're setting up you can go

532
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:57,360
anywhere that is to sort of build tools

533
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,039
to funnel this information around and

534
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,720
also provide the tools to gather that

535
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,360
information so right here this is uh

536
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,309
this this is my opportunity to talk

537
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:10,769
about the website because this this

538
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:13,620
project has so many different pieces I'm

539
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,230
not going to get too technical but I can

540
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,909
tell you a little bit about what what

541
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:19,110
the website is you know how the

542
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,659
technology that is based on right now

543
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:24,419
it's on AWS we use terraform a lot for

544
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,269
that the backends written in go we use

545
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,580
react and redux for the front-end so

546
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,380
there's a lot you know just basically

547
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,610
what you expect out of a modern

548
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,730
front-end and back-end stack nowadays

549
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,450
Postgres database post GIS but one of

550
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,340
our one of our you know key offerings

551
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,480
that we're trying to provide to people

552
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,340
as you know there's an API and their

553
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,690
data is there and they can get it they

554
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,130
can do whatever they want with it they

555
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,580
can share it and

556
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,230
and basically just stupid that

557
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,249
information however they see fit

558
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:54,590
whatever fits their needs and that's

559
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,909
information that doesn't include just a

560
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:57,399
sensor data that's information like

561
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:59,450
social media pictures Instagram Twitter

562
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,869
you know that kind of thing because one

563
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:04,669
of the important things you may have

564
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:06,350
gotten from transporter talk is the

565
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,080
story it's really important not just

566
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,629
that this data is collected but

567
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:12,950
sometimes it's really important the the

568
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,259
journey that goes into that that data

569
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:18,679
collection so visualization and showing

570
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:19,909
this data and the different screens of

571
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:21,320
data is really big part of what we we

572
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,580
spend a lot of time talking in the lab

573
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,220
about the best way to present this kind

574
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,919
of information and so it's really

575
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,749
important to us that it be consumable

576
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:32,359
and easy to use and and and share and

577
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,350
that kind of thing I'm going to now talk

578
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,580
about the hardware a little bit and we

579
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,389
actually have some of our our prototypes

580
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:44,179
here that we can pass around and I have

581
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,580
to forgive me because I am my background

582
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,710
is computer science I'm self-taught when

583
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,389
it comes to designing hardware and PCB

584
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:52,970
so if the EE people in the crowd can be

585
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,799
can go easy on me I'd really appreciate

586
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,169
it

587
00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:00,109
but field kits modular and so what we

588
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:02,809
mean by that is that we have what we

589
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:05,720
call our core or core board which in

590
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,899
this picture is this one right here and

591
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:11,029
that has most of the brains and so the

592
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,789
orchestrating software and hardware so

593
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:16,730
it's got GPS it's got there's a Wi-Fi

594
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,649
chip on there primarily for use with the

595
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:21,679
app it's got you know the the charging

596
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,989
circuitry there's some serial flash on

597
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:26,269
there and so on in fact there's one

598
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:27,980
being passed around it's the slender one

599
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,440
not the thick tall one and you can you

600
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,419
can see what's on there if you have any

601
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,309
questions after you can ask me to but

602
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:35,350
then we have all these other modules

603
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,059
that are used to you know we have sensor

604
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,590
modules for example right here with the

605
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,789
multicolored boards that's our water

606
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:43,070
quality module which you saw in a

607
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,369
previous slide and we have weather ones

608
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:48,889
which is the one with these jacks on

609
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:51,470
there and in various other modules and

610
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,659
we have a collection of protocols that

611
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:55,129
are used to communicate between the core

612
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:56,710
and there's all open source and we

613
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,789
provide the firmware so that people can

614
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:00,049
make their own modules that they want

615
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:01,970
and it's very it's easy enough to say

616
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,169
hey

617
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:05,149
if I want to provide data to the core

618
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,340
module all I need to do is implement

619
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,860
this function and it's in the it's in

620
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,269
the field kit ecosystem and that's

621
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:12,980
that's one of our primary goals and so

622
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,519
it's tagged both timewise and geo is and

623
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:20,840
that kind of thing and and so yeah so

624
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,070
this there are some instances where we

625
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,990
we don't necessarily need the modularity

626
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,360
one of those instances is with what

627
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,649
we're calling our naturalist board and

628
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:31,789
it's one that's going around it's got

629
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:34,700
the the grooves cut out on it and that's

630
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,139
an example of a board where we've taken

631
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:38,120
previous boards combine them into one

632
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,010
and recruiting this board for an app

633
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,309
called

634
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:41,450
I naturalist I don't know if anybody

635
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,010
raise their hands may be familiar with

636
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,340
AI naturalist yeah so an actress's an

637
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,039
app where I can be out you know in the

638
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,600
Mojave Desert or something like that and

639
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,610
see like a flower or cactus I can take a

640
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,220
picture of it and upload the observation

641
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,710
and there are people you know scientists

642
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,240
online they will identify that the robot

643
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,620
adjust it will tell me oh that's so and

644
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,059
so there's this you know genus whatever

645
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:05,659
and what we're trying to do is sort of

646
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:06,980
augment that data cuz right now it's

647
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,620
just a picture and a location and so our

648
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,389
hardware what we're trying to say is

649
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:14,389
let's let's take an environmental you

650
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:15,769
know reading of that situation let's

651
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:18,710
take pressure humidity light level two

652
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,840
you know and combine that and attach it

653
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,260
to these observations and over time

654
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,240
hopefully get an idea of of you know

655
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,519
what sort of environment it goes along

656
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,019
with these you know these plants these

657
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:31,220
animals and that kind of thing and sort

658
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,139
of add to that data that corpus of

659
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,889
information that's already you know very

660
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:38,630
well vetted on or you know filled out on

661
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,649
on axis and so this is not a modular

662
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:43,549
board but it's the one that's being

663
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:47,510
passed rapidly look at it there's

664
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,330
another sort of side of this in that

665
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,559
there's I mean what we're doing isn't

666
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,330
something that a lot of DIY or hacker

667
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,860
people aren't doing in the garages

668
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,919
already but one thing that happens is

669
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,510
people tend to learn the same lessons

670
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,429
over and over again because it's hard to

671
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:04,370
find information about particular sensor

672
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,179
or experience with a sensor in a certain

673
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,429
environment and so the idea is also that

674
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:13,520
field kit would have a library where you

675
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,980
could learn about how somebody you know

676
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,650
for example in this

677
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,390
like what are the what are the physical

678
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,530
characteristics of this particular

679
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,810
ultrasonic sensor and will it fit my use

680
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,860
case and and what are some gotchas in

681
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,990
deployment and what what are my lessons

682
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,310
that were learned and sort of get an

683
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,160
idea about you know you know choosing

684
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,410
between the different sensors because as

685
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,390
as we know in the electronics landscape

686
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,980
today there's a lot of options when it

687
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,120
comes to the different kinds of sensors

688
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,250
and knowing which one will work best for

689
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,040
your applications sometimes isn't is an

690
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,460
obvious especially when you consider the

691
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,040
environments that sometimes scientists

692
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,960
in this particular field are dealing

693
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,410
with you don't really have if there's

694
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,020
not a lot of it can be complicated

695
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,340
environmental eyes as well so we'll get

696
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,120
to in a little bit an example of another

697
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,980
thing we're trying to do this is a this

698
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,130
is a girly price meter it's for water

699
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,440
flow it's for detecting water flea it's

700
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,700
upright right now if you dip it in the

701
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,110
water and it measures the flow of water

702
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,450
and it was invented in like the early

703
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,790
1900s and this thing is about $3,000 and

704
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:25,260
it doesn't look like it costs $3,000 and

705
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,820
so one thing we have we've been working

706
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,220
with people to come up with an

707
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,300
open-source one that you can 3d print

708
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,570
and it may not last as long as that

709
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,090
beauty on the previous slide but you

710
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,550
know it's a lot cheaper and if it gets

711
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,970
the job job done then I'm not

712
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,770
complaining and so here right here is a

713
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,310
video of the same it's not the same one

714
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,390
was a different color but it's the same

715
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,210
sort of design being tested and so this

716
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,440
is the kind of thing we see going into

717
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,940
the libraries not just information about

718
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,140
sensors that are out there but sensors

719
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,500
you can make and deploy and and tweak to

720
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,720
your own needs if need be so well that's

721
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,040
one of the this is where we're spending

722
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,600
most of our time there are certain

723
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,400
places where we've actually gone and

724
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,600
been able to test and use this thing or

725
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,270
this platform and one of those places is

726
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,030
this is in the Peruvian Amazon at a

727
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,370
place called the boiling River and

728
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,410
that's a shaman was early morning one

729
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,130
day and this is not your regular kind of

730
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,900
mist

731
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,140
and I'll get to that and a little bit so

732
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,720
I I didn't know about this until last

733
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,410
year this is Andres Rizzo he has a TED

734
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,820
talk on the Boeing River and it's

735
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,660
absolutely fascinating and what uh what

736
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,690
he heard growing up in Peru was that

737
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,950
here about a myth about this boiling

738
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,330
River and it's a river somewhere in the

739
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,540
peruvian amazon that's boiling and

740
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,690
nobody knew where it was and the the

741
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,220
funny part of this story is he spent

742
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,440
some time looking couldn't find it until

743
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,450
one time he was at dinner with his aunt

744
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,910
and he was talking about you know his

745
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,850
lack of success in this area and she she

746
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,050
was actually know where that is i can

747
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,480
take you there tomorrow

748
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,730
and so he did not believe her so he

749
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,140
grabbed you know his temperature you

750
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,120
know engaging equipment and off they

751
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,160
they trekked took them half a day to get

752
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,390
there but they got there and so it

753
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,940
exists it's a river that's boiling it

754
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,820
starts cold and then water seeps up out

755
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,380
of the you know the Earth's gradient

756
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,150
along different parts of the river and

757
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,710
makes it incredibly hot at some point

758
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:46,320
this is a video that is video and so we

759
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,620
built a little buoy you can see here on

760
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,750
this expedition people refer to it as my

761
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,560
pet and it had a very early prototype of

762
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,090
field kit in it with one of our water

763
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,160
sensors this was back when we were in

764
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,230
the prototyping off-the-shelf phase so

765
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,090
it wasn't our it was our own PCB but it

766
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,430
was stuff through hold soldered onto a

767
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,370
board had gps a radio the water sensors

768
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,580
and I had a handheld unit that was

769
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,050
listening to the radio signals and

770
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,370
telling me where it was at the idea

771
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,280
being you know if I need to find it I

772
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,380
need to know how close I am and would

773
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,120
also show me the sensor readings and so

774
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,860
you can see this this steam rising off

775
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,360
the water cuz that water is very hot

776
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,350
here it's about 70 degrees Celsius but

777
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,320
there were parts that were you know 100

778
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,340
Celsius very easy and and so this is as

779
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,480
well as jobs to where you spend some

780
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,920
time going back to the physics and in

781
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,840
the open source library but I'm looking

782
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,280
up what are the tongs and my sensors

783
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,580
right now

784
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,490
and and I can say that there are parts

785
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,370
of this river that I had to use spare

786
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,559
sensors because it was it was very hot

787
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,200
one other thing that happens and I'll

788
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,250
let this play this has audio

789
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:37,010
the current was not very strong I think

790
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,720
we just gotta wait for it I think it'll

791
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,610
if you get it that way to the current

792
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:45,140
we'll take it eventually eventually also

793
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,020
we can throw rocks at it which is what

794
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,830
we ended up doing you know throwing

795
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,860
rocks at it there there are some things

796
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,100
that when you're gonna use you saw the

797
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,020
the picture that Shaw had of all the

798
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,970
bags there are some things you just

799
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,330
can't prepare for and it's easy to

800
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,770
forget how some things that have been

801
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,750
simple on expedition can be very

802
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,790
difficult when you change one thing for

803
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,620
example it would have been very easy to

804
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,040
get that buoy back if the water wasn't

805
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,290
scalding and dangerous and so it's it's

806
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,790
always it's always a learning experience

807
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,770
it definitely teaches you one of the

808
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,330
core principles Engineering is like what

809
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,750
can I anticipate what can I learn from

810
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,430
taking swinging from one into the

811
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:29,420
spectrum to the other there is another

812
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,760
project we have which is glaciers and as

813
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,340
you know right now the Arctic and the

814
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,310
Antarctic are in huge danger right now

815
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,350
and it's one of the biggest areas you

816
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,640
can see the effects of climate change

817
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,970
and and that sort of thing and so we

818
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,610
spend we had a project recently in Banff

819
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:50,090
National Park on the bow glacier to

820
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,070
monitor the effects of climate change

821
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,200
and and the effect it was having on on

822
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,820
that particular glacier and this was one

823
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,620
of the actually one of the pilot coolest

824
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,700
experiences I've ever had which and as

825
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,050
you'll see in a bit we had a lot of

826
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,120
equipment for this particular project

827
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,840
and the project was to set up a glacier

828
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,220
monitoring station on top of this

829
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,580
glacier and it was not a very

830
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,050
lightweight station it was a very heavy

831
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,970
station and so you couldn't just hike up

832
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,920
and within a backpack and so we needed

833
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,610
to Chopper in a lot of the year

834
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,880
in the equipment and it was definitely a

835
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,060
unique experience and but there was a

836
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,340
lot of preparation that went into it

837
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,250
here Shaw he actually hiked up with this

838
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,110
and I think you hurt your ankle on this

839
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,670
hike yeah and so we had geophones and

840
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,550
accelerometers this is us doing like

841
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,290
it's sort of a trial run to see if what

842
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,870
we had in mind was gonna work and and

843
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,600
and and sort of seeing you know can we

844
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,950
see what's happening on the glacier and

845
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,050
that sort of thing the way when when a

846
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,150
glacier melts it melts at the interface

847
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,310
between the ice and the bedrock and it

848
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,020
looks a lot it's a lot like an

849
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,390
earthquake there are nice quake and so

850
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,910
you can get some you know it's it's you

851
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,990
know so that's why we're on the rock

852
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,100
here and that sort of thing so here is

853
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,890
the station that eventually got set up

854
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,800
and I'll talk to you a little bit about

855
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,450
well what you're seeing here so at the

856
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,120
various so we have a huge tripod here at

857
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,580
the very top there's a wireless link

858
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,560
that goes down to a to a very similar

859
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,440
set up station at the and a lodge that's

860
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,610
about three kilometers away four

861
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,470
kilometers away and then a bunch of

862
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,110
solar panels this right here is another

863
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,580
part of the wireless link and then these

864
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,350
three Pelican cases are filled with car

865
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:42,300
batteries about 15 car batteries and the

866
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,160
fourth Pelican case on the Left housed

867
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:51,230
all the electronics and this is this is

868
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,670
it did not look this messy when we

869
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,850
deployed it I can I can assure you that

870
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,810
we were looking around for better

871
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,250
pictures today but this is the best we

872
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,630
could do this is actually in the lab as

873
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,880
we were setting it up but I wanted to

874
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,080
give you guys an idea of what it looked

875
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,120
like inside that that fourth Pelican

876
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,429
case so on the left is our charge

877
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:11,280
controller for the you know the solar

878
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,350
charger for the batteries in the center

879
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,000
is an accelerometer a very fancy

880
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,210
accelerometer actually from a company

881
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:22,440
here in Pasadena and then there is a

882
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,010
geophone the the you know the the ADC

883
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,540
for the geophone is right there

884
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,670
and then a Raspberry Pi with some hard

885
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,610
drives for restoring their data we have

886
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,290
another mill in the lab that we use to

887
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,969
prototype especially our through-hole

888
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:37,100
boards

889
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,350
but eventually that was we sent away for

890
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,560
you know a nice pretty purple board for

891
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,449
that one and that housed all that you

892
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,340
know voltage voltage stuff because a lot

893
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,239
of these things needed different

894
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,870
voltages and then one of my one of my

895
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,610
final slides is just an example the kind

896
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,909
of data that we get off the glacier we

897
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,240
work with a glaciologist his name is

898
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,790
Jeff Kavanagh and he is in Edmonton and

899
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,770
he we sent in some of our you know some

900
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,000
of our data and to produce these I

901
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,410
called them little you know balls a yarn

902
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,090
because I don't actually don't know what

903
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,920
I'm looking at but it's you know it was

904
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,040
cool again alright and then Shah is

905
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,240
actually going to talk to you about some

906
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,030
of our future projects they're coming up

907
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,710
yeah so that's actually like how the

908
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:29,010
glaciers oh sorry yeah that's how the

909
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,080
glaciers moving in in three-dimensional

910
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,840
space and these are like you know kind

911
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,570
of boring kind of academic type charts

912
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,340
but they're doing a lot of really cool

913
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,780
stuff with the data including a big

914
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,080
public art exhibition that I'm not

915
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,430
allowed to talk to you right talk about

916
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,930
right now so so yeah so we have a lot of

917
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,420
projects coming up I talked about the

918
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,300
Delta he mentioned the boiling River in

919
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,280
the bow glacier but we're going to the

920
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,880
Congo Basin in Cameroon with UCLA to

921
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,470
deploy a bunch of sensors we're working

922
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,000
with the Wildlife Conservation Society

923
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,700
to do water monitoring across the entire

924
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,330
Amazon basin all seven countries there I

925
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,880
mentioned the Belize and Antarctica

926
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,000
animal tracking projects there's some

927
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,610
work in Sri Lanka later on this year and

928
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,800
a bunch of other kind of random projects

929
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,310
that are in the works now so if you guys

930
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,140
are interested in kind of hearing more

931
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,700
about fields get or knowing when we

932
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,770
release it we've we've fortunately

933
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,690
gotten enough funding to take it to

934
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,690
public release this year so we're we're

935
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,300
in the middle of the taking prototypes

936
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,280
and turning it into something that is an

937
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,070
ugly phase but you could go to field kit

938
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,530
org and sign up and you'll kind of hear

939
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,120
more about the stuff that we're doing

940
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,740
there we're also building the team so so

941
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:49,990
if

942
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,390
interested just just reach out to us we

943
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,369
we need some expertise in some key areas

944
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:56,710
so over the next couple months we'll be

945
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,020
will be adding to the organization and

946
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,080
you can you can contact us through any

947
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,730
of the conserve five stuff if you want

948
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,680
to hear more so alright thank you

949
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,800
[Music]

950
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,179
