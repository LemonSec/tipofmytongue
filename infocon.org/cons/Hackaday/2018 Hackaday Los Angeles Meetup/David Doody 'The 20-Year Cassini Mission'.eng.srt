1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,570
being here tonight dad this is great

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,560
love being here with you

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,519
so Michelle made some parts or her

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,429
section made some parts that worked very

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,830
very very very well on a mission that

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,109
flew from here to Saturn and orbited

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,250
Saturn for 13 years and I get to talk to

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,939
you about that my my day job with JPL is

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,090
on the other end of JPL from Michelle

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,779
I'm in flight operations I led the

11
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,059
real-time flight operations engineering

12
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:39,660
for for the Cassini mission before I

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,910
forget

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,579
please carry away a bunch of these

15
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,800
handouts there's two different big

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,410
sheets and then there's some big posters

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,280
around by the the entrance one other

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,750
thing I want to start passing around

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,989
here whenever you see a spacecraft

20
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,789
whether it's being designed for Earth

21
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,640
orbit or for interplanetary flight

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,170
it'll look gold it'll look like it's got

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,439
covered in gold why do you always make

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,840
your spacecraft gold and people ask me

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,170
well you've seen captain you probably

26
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,270
use it on your 3d printers or whatever

27
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,700
projects you're working on captain is

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,490
like a Mylar it's a thin well any

29
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,420
thickness sheet of plastic and then when

30
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,159
you put aluminum on the back of it it

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,810
looks like a birthday balloon it's not

32
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,340
really metal it's it's aluminized

33
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,460
captain this is typical multi-layer

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,950
insulation that I want to pass around it

35
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,130
does a real good job of keeping the

36
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,200
spacecraft thermally controlled and

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
protecting it from dust hits and things

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,170
that might hit it anyway what I want to

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,130
talk to you about is why would one go to

40
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,250
Saturn the journey the journey that's my

41
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,350
favorite part and some of the results

42
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,729
I'm not going to stick a whole lot of

43
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,729
time into the results because the

44
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,340
results are online

45
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:17,270
go to Saturn JPL nasa.gov and you'll see

46
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,810
all the results from the mission are all

47
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:31,040
all available so first however I want to

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,400
start off with a two-minute movie by way

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,960
of introduction

50
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,350
it's got animations and a lot of actual

51
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,790
images from Saturn

52
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,180
there is our spacecraft there should be

53
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,459
some sound I think we plug in the sound

54
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,980
okay

55
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:35,080
any questions so far yeah well Michelle

56
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,000
is in the hardware building and testing

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,210
and designing I'm in the cockpit flying

58
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,120
it real-time operations

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:52,600
oh the Cassini is it's named after the

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,550
17th century astronomer giovanni

61
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,620
domenico cassini and the probe that we

62
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,110
carried to the Saturn system

63
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,350
I pronounce Huygens but I gave a

64
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,000
presentation to a bunch of Dutch

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,760
students and they corrected me and it's

66
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,260
more like Huggins that's not quite right

67
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,959
but it's more a guttural and he was

68
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,930
Christian Huggins was the person who

69
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,740
invented the pendulum clock and he

70
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,450
discovered Saturn's largest moon Titan

71
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,650
Titan is the movie play for two minutes

72
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,160
thank you

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,120
[Music]

74
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,420
that's the moon I analyst

75
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,039
slowly people started to gather around

76
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:59,659
these images which no one had seen

77
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:01,919
close-up images flying right over the

78
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,210
tops of the Rings and they were just

79
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,039
goose bumps I've had some memory I will

80
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,759
never forget

81
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:30,339
[Music]

82
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:33,529
Hasini has changed the paradigm of where

83
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:36,139
we might look for life it could be a

84
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,659
world around a giant planet and have

85
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:42,248
conditions that are right for life

86
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:56,170
[Music]

87
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,390
it's just a monumental machine it's the

88
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,690
individual people that I'll put their

89
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,280
pride in putting and putting this

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,800
together and building it right

91
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,450
[Music]

92
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,450
[Applause]

93
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,360
[Music]

94
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:25,479
then in Cassini's final orbit plunging

95
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:28,870
into saturn measuring the composition of

96
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,499
Saturn's atmosphere sending back science

97
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:35,259
till the very last second we'll continue

98
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,740
to learn from Cassini long after the end

99
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,570
of the mission

100
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:52,510
[Music]

101
00:06:52,510 --> 00:07:01,130
so why Saturn well that's why that's a

102
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,460
typical view from a good telescope like

103
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,950
out on the street on Colorado Boulevard

104
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,590
under the streetlights you can get it if

105
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,300
you've got a good telescope sitting out

106
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,700
there or in dark skies no matter where

107
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,210
you can see a view like that of that

108
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,420
planet that the planet is all gasp it's

109
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,340
all hydrogen a little bit of helium it's

110
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,560
ten times the diameter of Earth and

111
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,110
those rings going out towards the inside

112
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,930
that's the a ring that's the B ring and

113
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,760
you can see a little bit of the C ring

114
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:41,180
up against the planet the division

115
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,540
between the a and B rings here is this

116
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,720
dark area that was discovered by our

117
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,270
scientist in the 17th century

118
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,700
yeah

119
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:11,550
Oh like a rap star oh I see okay cool

120
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,210
now when Galileo saw this object in the

121
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,080
sky in 1610 it blew his mind he had

122
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,240
already discovered the moons orbiting

123
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,550
Jupiter and broke the news to humans

124
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,620
that we are not the center of everything

125
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,330
in the universe because there's moons

126
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,040
going around some other body and then he

127
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,350
looked at Saturn and the Rings he

128
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,830
couldn't focus he couldn't resolve they

129
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,380
just blew his mind I could go on but I

130
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,370
think it won't so it's the Rings go

131
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,190
there to study the Rings the Rings are a

132
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,450
system of things orbiting a center a

133
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,800
central object if you're a particle in

134
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,510
the rings you go around in a matter of

135
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,630
hours even though planet is gigantic ten

136
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,330
times the Earth's diameter five hours to

137
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,400
go around in the inner ring fifteen

138
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,230
hours to go around in the outer ring as

139
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,760
opposed to 250 million years in another

140
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,680
disk system this is a galaxy probably

141
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,900
looks very much like our own galaxy and

142
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,540
so the same physics apply you have an

143
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,680
orbiting laboratory in the rings of

144
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,010
Saturn other disk systems a forming

145
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,620
solar system maybe this is an early

146
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,350
picture of our own solar system well

147
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,810
their planets are forming out of a ring

148
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:40,420
system orbiting disk and if you're an

149
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,850
atmospheric scientist interested in

150
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,490
atmospheres you love a planet that's all

151
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,550
atmosphere and the moons here's

152
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,390
Enceladus that little 500 kilometer

153
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,570
diameter moon made of mostly ice and

154
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,780
rock down inside that has a global ocean

155
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,900
and it's offering free samples spewing

156
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,280
these samples out into space constantly

157
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,940
geysers once

158
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,340
we discovered the geysers the science

159
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,830
team said let's fly through them and so

160
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,970
the navigators who are phenomenal

161
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,330
everything's moving

162
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,740
Saturn's going around the Sun earth is

163
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,470
going around the Sun earth is rotating

164
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,820
and solidus is going around Saturn

165
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,710
everything is moving and they put us 25

166
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,980
kilometers off the deck that's a 500

167
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,840
kilometer diameter there

168
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,530
so what's 25 kilometers we did that we

169
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,140
flew through the plumes measured them

170
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,210
figured out what they're made of mostly

171
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:45,430
water lots of organic chemistry so the

172
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,080
moon's here's another moon this is this

173
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,390
one is only 150 kilometres long Hyperion

174
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,620
is spongy its density we can measure the

175
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,660
density of these things the density is

176
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,360
less than that of water so it's got a

177
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,950
lot of open space inside there I happen

178
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,810
us that we saw in the movie in the movie

179
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,910
we saw the mountain there's a if it were

180
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,970
darker you could see that it sticks up

181
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,650
13 kilometers high around the entire

182
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,890
equator of this weird moon this is more

183
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,030
like 1500 kilometers in diameter and

184
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,300
when Cassini the astronomer discovered

185
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,260
hi Appetit

186
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,810
he could only see it when it was on the

187
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,940
west side of the planet when her ground

188
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,740
went around to the east side it

189
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,440
disappeared and he correctly surmised

190
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,440
that a just like our moon it keeps the

191
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,930
same face tidally locked to the planet

192
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,680
and be one-half the leading half was

193
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,470
full of dark stuff that's the scientific

194
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,630
term and the whole leading hemisphere is

195
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,060
as dark as tar and the trailing

196
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,089
hemisphere is as bright as freshly

197
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:08,470
fallen snow if you look at the boundary

198
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,500
between them zoom in you find that it's

199
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,990
very clearly separated blotches and

200
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,370
there are thermal reasons for that that

201
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,699
the scientists under

202
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:23,179
and I'm not a scientist therefore I

203
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,189
don't understand it but this slide

204
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:27,679
though was brought to you by that

205
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,869
computer company and the neighborhood

206
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:35,449
it's go to Saturn to learn about your

207
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:37,459
neighborhood what's it like to live in a

208
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,319
solar system what's it like to live in a

209
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:42,019
planet you you start to build knowledge

210
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:43,339
about your environment

211
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:45,499
speaking of neighborhoods this is the

212
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,540
neighborhood in Teaneck New Jersey where

213
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:53,179
I grew up when I was 7 I guess 6 or 7 my

214
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,919
grandfather and my father got together

215
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,799
and built this 16 foot tall rocket ship

216
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:00,529
in the backyard painted it all aluminum

217
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,829
and so my friends and I are seen in the

218
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:06,529
newspaper here flying around the solar

219
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:11,109
system I was well prepared for my job so

220
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:14,689
nowadays you can find me here's some

221
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:17,329
Europa people out on the sidewalk here's

222
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,919
my telescope trained on on Europa

223
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:24,769
because that moon of Jupiter has got

224
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:28,279
that warm that Michelle mentioned warm

225
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,850
saltwater ocean where could there be

226
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,100
life and if there is life then is it

227
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,149
dna-based completely separate genesis of

228
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:44,809
life are they related at all and so far

229
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:48,919
we have a sample size of one for life on

230
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,129
a planet if life is discovered right in

231
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,199
our backyard what does that mean it

232
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:57,350
means life is ubiquitous it can evolve

233
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,829
anywhere if there's not life there well

234
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:04,600
look at the next place so the journey is

235
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,910
is pretty fascinating we we spent about

236
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,859
seven years getting out to to Saturn we

237
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:15,079
used the gravity assist technique I'll

238
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:17,720
mention a little more about that but we

239
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,589
built a spacecraft thanks to mechanical

240
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:26,419
people like Michelle's sections and we

241
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:29,629
flew it so let's have a closer look at

242
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:32,569
the spacecraft you can see some of that

243
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:33,170
thermal Blaine

244
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,510
getting with the captain the aluminized

245
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,260
captain already in place on some of the

246
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,510
instruments that's the German dust

247
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,060
detector cosmic dust detector that every

248
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,829
particle of dust that it encountered it

249
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:47,779
we can measure the mass the chemical

250
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:51,589
species the electrical charge several

251
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:58,699
other barometers the instruments are all

252
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:02,600
bolted here to the spacecraft my friend

253
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,660
Preston sitting down there is holding a

254
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,550
nice 3d printed Cassini model he printed

255
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,790
that it's it's you can use just a common

256
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,639
FDM printer it's got a dozen or so parts

257
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,810
and it pushes clips together into a

258
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,529
pretty nice 3d printed Cassini now look

259
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:25,760
at the poster in back of it and that's

260
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,070
the poster that we've got out front so

261
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,680
please grab all this stuff I don't want

262
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,470
to be carrying this home so back to our

263
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,949
spacecraft that big hat the the

264
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:39,610
communications dish up on top was used

265
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,250
for radar imaging using synthetic

266
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,370
aperture radar technique where you point

267
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,980
that dish at Titan as you go by and you

268
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,320
can see through Titans otherwise opaque

269
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,810
atmosphere and then see what's on the

270
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,600
surface and with that we measured and

271
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,720
discovered these links on the surface

272
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,110
underneath the the cloudy hazy opaque

273
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,250
atmosphere and also for communications

274
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,779
and navigation so we would turn that

275
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:14,440
spacecraft upside down and point it at

276
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,079
huge antennas on earth these are of the

277
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,990
Deep Space Network there are three

278
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,390
locations around the world out in the

279
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,920
California desert it's called go

280
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,160
Goldstone it's near Barstow they give a

281
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,519
good tour out there by the way another

282
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,170
complex is in Madrid Spain and another

283
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,720
one in Canberra Australia so as the

284
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,269
Earth turns at least one of these

285
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,970
complexes can see something orbiting

286
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,560
Saturn or crawling around on Mars

287
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,860
or investigating venusaur or Voyager and

288
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,770
the deep deep deep deep part of the

289
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,950
outside of the solar system and there

290
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,580
are there three or four times as many

291
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,900
users competing for the Deep Space

292
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,050
Network then there are actual antennas

293
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:10,579
to serve them the communications are one

294
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,569
thing we use digital communications the

295
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,099
navigation tracking data is another

296
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:20,650
thing we use the line-of-sight

297
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,329
measurements of distance which send a

298
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,520
pulse out spacecraft would recognize the

299
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,220
pulse would know how many nanoseconds it

300
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,870
takes for the electronics to turn it

301
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,480
around and send it back and so we could

302
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,980
measure the distance line-of-sight to

303
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,120
the spacecraft constantly during say

304
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,150
nine hours of a day down to a precision

305
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,820
of one meter or so within one meter you

306
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,710
know where the spacecraft is and the

307
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,340
speed that same line-of-sight radio link

308
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,660
guess how you measure the speed stop

309
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,670
like yeah you measure the Doppler shift

310
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,810
and using the Doppler shift you can

311
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:04,130
navigate basically any spacecraft with a

312
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,970
speed measurement of less than a

313
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,330
millimeter per second now I like to

314
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,030
belabor that I'm gonna hold my hands a

315
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,300
meter apart and I'm gonna clap my hands

316
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,670
together at the rate of one millimeter

317
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,450
per second

318
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:29,169
how long is it gonna take a thousand

319
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:32,289
seconds yeah at one millimeter so I'm

320
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:33,879
driving home the point that it's a very

321
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,609
tiny increment of speed that you can

322
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:38,799
measure very accurately a billion miles

323
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,940
away in fact we commonly navigated

324
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,509
Cassini using using a precision of 1/100

325
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:54,700
of a millimeter per second let's see oh

326
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,279
here's my friend Todd holding up

327
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,809
measurement you know a mil awhat about 3

328
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:07,690
milliwatts are necessary to drive your

329
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,090
cell phone in sleep mode 3 milliwatts

330
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,450
and the power of the signal coming back

331
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,789
and having been collected by a 70 meter

332
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:18,789
diameter reflector dish and then fed

333
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:20,830
through its first stage of application

334
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,919
amplification is of the strength of 0.15

335
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:31,359
zeroes to 5 1 milliwatts and that plenty

336
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,639
of power to do everything you need for

337
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,159
navigation to a digital communications

338
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:38,679
it's the Deep Space Network has been an

339
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,519
amazing organization to work with so our

340
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:46,029
spacecraft then I mentioned that the the

341
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:48,070
instruments are all bolted to the side

342
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,019
so if you want to point the camera or

343
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:53,109
spectrometer you have to turn the whole

344
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,090
spacecraft and and the optical

345
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,470
instruments they're covered the whole

346
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,229
spectrum from infrared all the way up

347
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:01,690
through visiting visible and ultraviolet

348
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:06,599
in imaging and spectroscopy really

349
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:10,919
thorough coverage of the spectrum so

350
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,769
normally to control the spacecraft you

351
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:16,749
can use one of two ways you can use

352
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,210
these little rocket thrusters there's

353
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,960
four struts coming out at the bottom and

354
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,129
you just make little one Newton rocket

355
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:33,609
thrusts but for finest pointing for

356
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,339
pointing your cameras you've used these

357
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:37,330
reaction wheels

358
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:43,690
these are 10 kilogram wheels that are

359
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,210
driven by an electric motor so if you

360
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,650
want to turn your spacecraft one way you

361
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,690
spin the wheel with the electric motor

362
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,210
the other way you trade angular momentum

363
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,230
back and forth between the wheel and the

364
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,040
whole spacecraft in three axes here my

365
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,130
attitude control engineer friend lists

366
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,590
and rate' is going to demonstrate how

367
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,520
that works that's about the same mass

368
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,520
and size of one of Cassini's reaction

369
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,500
wheel on this money that's my electric

370
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,610
drill it's kind of dangerous don't I

371
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:24,220
couldn't try this right okay wave to the

372
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,590
audience all right thanks thanks Luis

373
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,880
that's a garden paving stone about 20 20

374
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:46,600
pounds worth so it's a rocketship and it

375
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,400
depends on those little thrusters and

376
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,580
then they the main engines down here

377
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:57,120
whose cover was made by Michelle's team

378
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,880
we open the cover and close the cover

379
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,940
with that actuator it was designed for

380
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,850
some number of operations I don't know

381
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,000
maybe it was 20 30 here so but we went

382
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,430
like 10 times as many operations on that

383
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,890
with our extended mission extended

384
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,590
mission extended extended mission and it

385
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,300
always worked just great but the the

386
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,910
rocket itself it's got that

387
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:26,130
normal-looking rocket bell shape that

388
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,220
all spacecraft have and that's thanks to

389
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,030
a steam engineer in the late 1800s

390
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:40,210
Gustav de laval needed a nozzle just

391
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,780
about steam as fast as it could he

392
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,820
wanted a high velocity coming out of the

393
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,100
nozzle to spin a turbine it's been at

394
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,950
steam turbine and so he did

395
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,960
the experimental Zion and math at high

396
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,400
temperatures and pressures he worked out

397
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,770
the fluid dynamics and and developed the

398
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,010
shape such that at the if the gas is

399
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,250
moving this way at the throat of the

400
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,320
venturi there at the most narrow point

401
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,450
if you reach the speed of sound Mach one

402
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,950
marvelous things happen that exit

403
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,640
velocity that you need for space travel

404
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:24,010
skyrockets anybody get the pun and it's

405
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,250
at the expense of temperature and

406
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,720
pressure which is good if you want to

407
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,710
avoid melting your engine so we applied

408
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,570
that principle and took off in 1997 and

409
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,750
flew for about seven years to get out to

410
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,290
Saturn here's the flight plan there's

411
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,290
the Sun in the middle what has happened

412
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:54,700
to my okay yeah do not put beer on your

413
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,240
laser pointer so there's the orbit of

414
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,910
Earth that find Grail I'm going around

415
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,380
the Sun everything goes counterclockwise

416
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,220
when you look down from the north and we

417
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,530
fired off Cassini and then slowed it

418
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,360
down compared to earth and had dropped

419
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,030
inward towards the Sun we passed by

420
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,750
Venus that gave us a kick using gravity

421
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,120
assist to get out and we followed that

422
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,730
blue path now God is high from the Sun

423
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,640
climbing away from the sun's gravity

424
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,590
about the same distance as Mars's orbit

425
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,920
and then we came back around each of

426
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,620
those loops is about a year and passed

427
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,520
by Venus again passed by earth those two

428
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,590
gravity assists gave us the kick to get

429
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,450
out into the outer solar system where we

430
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,390
did it again to Jupiter they'll say it's

431
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,400
to Jupiter because the way gravity

432
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,030
assist works here's here's Jupiter

433
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,020
hauling its mass around the Sun a huge

434
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,870
amount of mass a great distance half a

435
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,500
million no five hundred million

436
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,380
kilometers or miles

437
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,230
out from the Sun and you sneak up behind

438
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,560
the planet with your spacecraft and of

439
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,030
course Jupiter pulls in on your

440
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,340
spacecraft because Jupiter's got gravity

441
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,040
the spacecraft has gravity it's a

442
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,930
physical object in the universe and it

443
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,940
has its own little bit of gravitation

444
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,600
and the spacecraft pulls back on Jupiter

445
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,170
slows it down ever so little you can't

446
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,400
measure it but you can certainly

447
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,910
calculate it and that slowing down

448
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,070
Jupiter connects you it's called an

449
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,070
elastic collision so that you can soak

450
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,610
up

451
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,790
Jupiter's momentum and get a kick for

452
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,180
your spacecraft it's almost like a

453
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,990
baseball hitting a baseball bat hitting

454
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,670
baseball coming in you transfer momentum

455
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,450
from the huge source of momentum and

456
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:54,410
kick your your spacecraft out that was

457
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,870
invented by a student working for JPL in

458
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:04,310
1961 during the summer summer student as

459
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,950
we flew by Jupiter who took some

460
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,010
pictures there is Jupiter the planet in

461
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,550
the back there's the little moon anybody

462
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,260
recognize that orange looking moon Io

463
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,230
with volcanoes going off constantly and

464
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,780
there's iOS shadow so here's here's the

465
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,270
student Michael min of itch

466
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,340
last I checked he's working at a

467
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,580
pharmaceutical company in Los Angeles

468
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,940
but he worked it all out and for the

469
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,780
crews from Earth to Saturn we gained a

470
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,260
huge amount of Delta view Delta V

471
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,120
changed in velocity using our own

472
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,270
thrusters and engines on the spacecraft

473
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,280
you'd burn the engine and get a little

474
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,130
Delta V of maybe a meter per second

475
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,890
maybe a tenth of a meter per second

476
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,900
maybe 10 meters per second in that in

477
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,740
that area but using gravity assists the

478
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,070
planets gave us twenty two thousand

479
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,710
meters per second that's a lot of fuel

480
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,480
that we didn't have to carry and then

481
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,650
for orbiting in the Saturn system for 13

482
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,540
years

483
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,130
we use Titan by typing the big heavy

484
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,740
5,000 kilometer diameter big moon of

485
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,500
Saturn and that gave us 90,000 meters

486
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,179
per second all we had to do is make

487
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,299
little adjustments on the timing and

488
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:36,400
direction to fly by Titan each time so

489
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,210
we flew by Jupiter cruised for another

490
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,669
while and then we got to Saturn and

491
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:46,150
here's a quick little way for you to

492
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:54,549
join us in arriving at Saturn good

493
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:56,380
evening and welcome to cassini-huygens

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,049
flight team is in place for s Oh aye

497
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:08,320
that is Saturn orbit insertion and that

498
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,510
is when the spacecraft must be captured

499
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,330
by Saturn's gravity Rory it will fly

500
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,669
right on past the planet and the mission

501
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:18,280
is over time to turn back around to the

502
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,260
SOI burn attitude or pointing position

503
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,669
and light up the rockets

504
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,340
we have a picture

505
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,990
[Music]

506
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,070
9:05 p.m. Saturday lifetime the SOI burn

507
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,410
is approximately 92% complete and we

508
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,240
expect the track Doppler now through the

509
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,640
end of the burner that engine been quite

510
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,320
hot for 100 minutes

511
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,710
[Music]

512
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,330
we have burned complete here

513
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:58,349
it was four years for shin there but

514
00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:02,279
maybe 20 years for others so we we flew

515
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,580
every which way around Saturn high

516
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,220
inclination low inclination close in far

517
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,369
out to sample every part of the

518
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:15,019
magnetosphere and and every one of the

519
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,359
satellites the natural satellites

520
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,629
there's there's Titan where we flew by

521
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:25,080
Titan very often to get the gravity

522
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,840
assist so results as I said I'm not even

523
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,549
spend a whole lot of time on the results

524
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:36,710
but here's what we saw on approach in

525
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,769
2004 before going into orbit at Saturn

526
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:43,320
this huge thing 10 times the Earth's

527
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,440
diameter at the equator it's only 9

528
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,299
times the Earth's diameter it's fat

529
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,669
around the middle is it there's a

530
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:53,220
rotating ball of gas and look at the

531
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,759
Rings you can see the the a ring B ring

532
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,509
C ring the shadow the strands of the C

533
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:03,029
ring the Cassini division between the a

534
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:05,039
and B rings only the sunlight falling

535
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,169
through the Cassini division and

536
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:09,899
lighting up the upper blue sky above the

537
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,899
brown haze that's lower down in Saturn's

538
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:16,440
atmosphere you can never see this from

539
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,169
Earth looking at Saturn from Earth all

540
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:21,470
you can see is a fully illuminated

541
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,269
planet and maybe a little bit of shadow

542
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:26,099
around the edge of the planet falling

543
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,289
back on the Rings but look at the shadow

544
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:30,840
on the Rings off to the ninety degrees

545
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:37,470
or so the night side of the planet yeah

546
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,289
and we got our spacecraft around into

547
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:44,609
the shadow of the planet from there we

548
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,559
could safely turn the instruments back

549
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,259
and look towards the Sun on earth you'd

550
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:51,509
never do that because without being in

551
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:53,609
the shadow because the sunlight would

552
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:56,190
burn out your your optics or your image

553
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:01,009
sensors which on Cassini were all si CDs

554
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:04,559
well I can literally go on for an hour

555
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,130
about this one image but

556
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,680
won't but I'll tell you that see that

557
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,920
faint ring out there you can see it

558
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,530
because it's very faint particles lit up

559
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:18,080
from behind and you're seeing forward

560
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,210
scattered light now just like driving in

561
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,980
the Sun your windshield you see all the

562
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,950
fine dust as you're going towards the

563
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,690
sunlight and you go okay it's time to

564
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:32,150
clean the windshield now but also the B

565
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,450
ring shows that it's opaque it's not

566
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,070
permitting a lot of sunlight to come

567
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,080
through the a ring is lighting up a

568
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,570
little brighter the C ring is lighting

569
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,540
up from all the fine particles in it and

570
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,780
now you can see the D ring inside this

571
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,130
bright strand is a very thin strand it's

572
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,710
a little bit over overblown because of

573
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,560
how bright it is we'll see that it's the

574
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,260
F ring we'll see it closer up a little

575
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,840
while it's freshly ground ring particles

576
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,240
I'll show you what that means and so the

577
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,370
fresh grinding of all those ice

578
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,690
particles and the Rings

579
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,910
means that they they're very fine and

580
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:15,170
they light up very brightly now and this

581
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,370
is one of the the lithography pages I

582
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,170
want to give out I don't want to take

583
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,880
any of these homes and please grab some

584
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,580
for your friends this is natural color

585
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,020
it's what you would see if you were

586
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,050
there and these are not image flaws they

587
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,950
are little shadows of the Rings

588
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,860
refracted around through the atmosphere

589
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,000
sunlight refracted through the

590
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,660
atmosphere the Sun is right about here

591
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,120
back there and so now you can see all

592
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,090
the Rings see the a ring the B ring the

593
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,670
C ring the D ring the e-ring I was

594
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,460
thinking about getting an e ring the e

595
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,760
ring is created by enceladus's geysers

596
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,680
that the little moon that's got the the

597
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,420
geysers going off constantly if there's

598
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,960
a geysers on Enceladus shut off that

599
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,380
earring would sublimate away in probably

600
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,200
tens to hundreds of years and then

601
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,880
there's that little dots that little dot

602
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,280
on the left

603
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,290
is the F ring there's that little dot

604
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:26,120
anybody know what that little dot is hmm

605
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,610
Cassini Earth somebody says earth well

606
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:35,070
let's take a closer look yeah yeah

607
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,620
what's ours

608
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,270
there's Titan there's a natural view of

609
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,030
Titan except that you have to be at the

610
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,520
Saturn system to be able to see the

611
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,720
Nightside of Titan high atmospheric haze

612
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,559
turns blue that's where the methane in

613
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,030
the it's a nitrogen atmosphere just

614
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,030
about the same density as Earth's

615
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:03,890
nitrogen atmosphere a little bit more

616
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,570
5,000 kilometers in diameter so it's a

617
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:10,770
great big moon full of momentum that we

618
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,270
stole a lot of don't tell anybody

619
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:17,699
so chemistry happens the sunlight hits

620
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:20,219
that methane high up there methane is

621
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,790
ch4 carbon and four hydrogen's they all

622
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,310
break apart in the ultraviolet light and

623
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,159
then they recombine and snow down on to

624
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,190
the surface they create hydrocarbons

625
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:36,619
snow that that moves around in dunes

626
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,710
there's an infrared view looking through

627
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,500
the atmosphere with our instruments you

628
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,770
can see clouds these are the dark

629
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,260
lowlands where those dunes of

630
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,879
hydrocarbon II stuff landed and blown er

631
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,619
got blown around I think I'll skip this

632
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,160
movie and the interest oh no that wasn't

633
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,710
the movie here's okay this is a nice

634
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,980
radar synthetic radar image of one of

635
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,250
the lakes of methane it's very cold it's

636
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,830
90 kelvins on the surface of Titan so

637
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,990
the rocks are made of water and the

638
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,420
liquid is made of liquid methane this is

639
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,660
the movie that I'm gonna skip and

640
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,150
there's the F ring I've been quacking

641
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,359
about so much and I call it freshly

642
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:25,710
ground because this little moon

643
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,890
Prometheus orbits Saturn in a slightly

644
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,820
more elliptical path

645
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,250
than the F ring particles and it comes

646
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,720
out once every 15 hours around Saturn no

647
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,720
going this way and it clobbers the F

648
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,080
ring actually enters the ring and helps

649
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,970
grind up the particles and makes them

650
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:50,080
fine this was taken at solstice where

651
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,540
the sunlight was edged on to the Rings

652
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:57,300
so look at the shadow of Prometheus cast

653
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,530
across a ring here's the F ring again a

654
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,960
little Prometheus having done its deed

655
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,430
there 15 hours before the time before

656
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,250
and this series of images is an actual

657
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,430
series of pictures looking outward

658
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,170
towards the F ring catching Prometheus

659
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,270
in the act then we went into the shadow

660
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,700
of Saturn but after we came out there's

661
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,910
the the damage having been done would

662
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,010
you like fresh ground ring particles

663
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,460
with fatter

664
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,610
this is Enceladus this is the 500

665
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,740
kilometer diameter little moon little

666
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,420
ball of ice with the South Pole showing

667
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,250
crevasses and there's with the sunlight

668
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,810
from behind lighting up the fine

669
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:51,670
particles that are streaming out it's a

670
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,660
rate more than say the Yellowstone Old

671
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,250
Faithful geyser and they just go off

672
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,610
constantly they they kind of seep out of

673
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:04,480
the crevices around the South Pole so

674
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,640
flying through them we discovered it's

675
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,720
mostly water there's a lot of nh3

676
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,750
ammonia organic chemicals hydrogen all

677
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:20,620
pointing to a warm saltwater ocean with

678
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,990
a high likelihood of thermal vent

679
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,510
activity like in our oceans we have

680
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,840
these thermal vents that volcanic vents

681
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,020
and the on the sea floors and in some

682
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,000
places there are little communities of

683
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,490
life that have never seen the Sun so

684
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:40,490
that's a possibility for

685
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:44,160
life elsewhere in our solar system and

686
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,650
cell it is one of the places that we

687
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:49,380
want to go back and have a good look so

688
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,859
we finished up the mission by taking a

689
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:56,220
gravity assist tighten that put us into

690
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,420
20 to know 20 of these orbits that came

691
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,630
in as close as the F ring so we got

692
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,180
really good up-close images of the Rings

693
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,150
and of Saturn and then these blue orbits

694
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,670
and other gravity assists put us through

695
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:17,550
22 of those and the final one we burned

696
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,869
in became a meteor with our spacecraft

697
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:24,270
into the upper atmosphere of Saturn

698
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:28,940
going 125 thousand kilometers per hour

699
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:34,380
here's a look at the final path in there

700
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,569
is the September 11 flyby of Titan that

701
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:42,180
soaked up enough of our own momentum the

702
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,890
spacecraft's own momentum that it

703
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,650
couldn't climb as high on the way in and

704
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,230
so it burned in to the atmosphere

705
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:53,400
instead of making another loop took the

706
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,650
last image right there September 14 half

707
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,809
a day before played back the data and

708
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:06,359
then switched to a mode where all the

709
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:07,980
data had been played back off of the

710
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,829
recorders and we had switched to a mode

711
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:13,799
where the instruments were sending their

712
00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:16,410
data directly back to earth measuring

713
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:21,059
the Institut components the atmospheric

714
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,829
composition and whatnot right to the

715
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:26,030
last second and here is the final

716
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:33,390
picture that was returned this is the

717
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,750
night side of Saturn now there's a

718
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:41,190
little bit of the C ring in there and

719
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:46,920
here's this big dark equatorial band if

720
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,710
you were floating in a balloon there

721
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,840
blimp in that

722
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,820
equatorial region on the night side of

723
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,610
Saturn you'd look out to the Rings and

724
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,550
wouldn't see them because your edge on

725
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,040
to the Rings from the equator and the

726
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,590
Rings are hundreds of thousands of

727
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,960
kilometers wide but only a few meters

728
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,050
maybe tens of meters in thickness and so

729
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,980
from there you can't see them and

730
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,170
correspondingly no ring light comes back

731
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,770
to light up the atmosphere so this is

732
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:22,170
all ring light up here and down here and

733
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,740
that's the dark night of Saturn here's

734
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,730
the view that we had my team works in

735
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,310
this room if you have you been dude JPL

736
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,080
for a tour or Open House or anything

737
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,500
this is a familiar spot there's an open

738
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,260
house coming up I think it's in June of

739
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,780
this year they'll announce tickets and

740
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,640
then you got to watch out for tickets

741
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,310
because they go away real quick

742
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:52,820
Mission Control there's my ace Mike and

743
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,760
this is the data we my team's job was to

744
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,700
watch the engineering telemetry coming

745
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,950
back from the spacecraft to make sure

746
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,570
that all the temperatures and pressures

747
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,760
and computer states and everything were

748
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,190
proper and if anything was out of limits

749
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,510
we'd take action what what kind of

750
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,560
action well if if say it was a

751
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,320
temperature going to high on a thruster

752
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,210
or something we would call the the

753
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,300
propulsion team they would come in

754
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,050
they'd analyze their data often it would

755
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,270
be an instrument acting up like we have

756
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,220
a magnetometer a magnetic field sensor

757
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,140
sticking out on the boom take a look at

758
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,780
that that little effigy I brought back

759
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,570
there the magnetometers are hanging out

760
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,700
in the breeze and every once in a while

761
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,460
they would decide not to talk to the bus

762
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,980
anymore and so you'd have to send up a

763
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,160
command to reset the magnetometer bus

764
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,340
interface unit and lots of little things

765
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,030
but thank goodness very few serious

766
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,150
things ever happened here's the signal

767
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,490
that we watched

768
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:09,030
for twenty years it's it's a big booming

769
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,510
that's the noise and that's the signal

770
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,210
from the spacecraft in around eight

771
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,860
thousand megahertz and we also had a

772
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,350
signal turned on at this point at around

773
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,000
two thousand megahertz so we had two

774
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,950
signals coming in and there was a third

775
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,650
actually but that's the x-band signal

776
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,120
that always carried all of our

777
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,630
navigation and telemetry and whatnot so

778
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,670
I'm gonna finish up showing you another

779
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:43,220
two-minute movie as kind of a summary

780
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,609
it's actual sound from the plasma

781
00:42:55,609 --> 00:42:59,270
interacting there's a opposition effect

782
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,690

here tonight it's been a real pleasure

794

for me and I have I have no idea thank

795
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,510
you thank you so much for good
