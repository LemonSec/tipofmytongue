[Music]

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,200
hey everyone

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,679
um i am charlene vonda this is making

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,360
glowy origami

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,840
and i'm excited to be with you all and

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,120
just hang out and chill

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,279
and uh and fold some paper so

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,039
as uh carrie mentioned earlier uh

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,080
i have been really fat well first of all

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,439
i've only been

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,960
sort of i've only discovered sort of

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,079
like making uh in the last couple years

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,680
and the thing that i really sort of

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,760
gravitated towards is

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,719
leds for some reason like i ended up

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,520
wanting

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,239
to put leds in everything um and the

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,079
first time that i discovered

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,520
that something like this

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,879
which is like a tiny little led

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,480
can sort of be grown and be captured

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,800
into a shape that looks like this let me

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,840
turn off this a little bit

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,719
like it really fascinated me that that

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,600
paper

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,760
as such a an approachable medium

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,560
can be can diffuse light really well and

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,240
you can make really interesting stuff

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,240
out of it so my hope for this section

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,680
is that you'll come away with some tools

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,080
and

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,960
pieces to add to your creative toolbox

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,640
and maybe give you some inspiration for

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,759
your next project

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,200
so we're not trying to be super um

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,759
perfect origami folders today we're just

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,720
trying to

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,560
learn some cool folds that you can do

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,400
to maybe incorporate it into your next

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,960
project so this is actually the first

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,720
thing that we're going to learn about

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,840
is the sonabe module

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,159
origami so it's going to look like this

44
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,399
let me put this aside for a second

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,280
so it's going gonna look like this um

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,920
it's

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,439
the basic modular fold um that you can

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
do and when i say modular it just means

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,280
we're gonna make a few of these and then

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
put them together and then we can make

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,360
them

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,639
into a shape okay so

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,400
if you have your paper ready

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,480
um the materials list had a list of

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,520
vellum paper like this so if you have it

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
you can cut it into a five and a half

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,319
inch square or any square

58
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,959
size you want this one specifically is

59
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,160
5.5

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,760
and if you haven't cut it yet i'm going

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,200
to show you an interesting

62
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,920
and easy way to make a square so if you

63
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,519
have like a letter size like this i'm

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,120
going to use i'm not using the volume

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,599
i'm just using regular copy paper you

66
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,080
can fold it in half

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,480
and my hope is that you know you'll be

68
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,519
able to

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,080
follow along in this workshop and then

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,800
i'll probably

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,760
stick around afterwards as well if you

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,319
guys want to hang out and fold some more

73
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,200
because you might not be done in half an

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
hour

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
so yeah so cut it in half so this is now

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,760
5.5 because like it's 11. and then

77
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,519
i'm gonna grab some scissors and you can

78
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,599
cut this actually you can even cut this

79
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,040
by hand

80
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,319
uh because if your fold is

81
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,800
um tight enough then you can it'll

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,480
actually just

83
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,920
tear off pretty smoothly so that's one

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,280
and don't worry if your scissor is not

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,920
uh your scissor line is not that

86
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,640
straight like it's not that important

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,000
uh let me turn on a little bit of the

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,680
light here okay

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,440
um so to make a square out of this

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,519
rectangle you can

91
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,000
fold it diagonally this way

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,840
you have you know scissors or cutter

93
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
then feel free to use that too but i'm

94
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,799
just showing you a good way to like make

95
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,680
a square

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,599
okay so now if we cut on this line

97
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,080
there we go if you cut this line then

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
you'll actually end up with a square so

99
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,439
i'm just going to follow that line

100
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,959
this

101
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,959
oh i've never cut paper live before

102
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,160
so this is great okay

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,199
so now you have a square and to prove to

104
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,240
you that it's kind of

105
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,880
the same this was a 5.5 and yay it's the

106
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,080
same one

107
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,199
cool so uh

108
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,600
prepare like maybe you'll get like two

109
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
of these squares um if you had that

110
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,400
letter size

111
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,199
vellum paper um which is gonna be

112
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:37,840
perfect

113
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,440
you might need one more if you wanna

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,040
follow along

115
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,560
okay so maybe i'll wait

116
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,080
a few seconds i'll wait a few seconds

117
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,280
for people to get their

118
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,639
stuff ready um

119
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,919
nice and just browsing through your

120
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,199
windows here

121
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,360
feel free to like turn on your cameras

122
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,720
too if you want

123
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,840
because then you can show me your

124
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,960
beautiful creations

125
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,840
okay great okay so now you have this

126
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,360
um um you can make

127
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,400
maybe like two three squares

128
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,479
is probably about four because you'll

129
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,000
you'll end up doing two

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680
um and then that should be enough for us

131
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,919
for now

132
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,479
oh uh the square is 5.5 inches

133
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,160
so it's like half the size of a

134
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,840
letter letter size paper

135
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:53,840
all right sweet

136
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,000
okay i'm gonna

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,759
so we're gonna do this a couple times so

138
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,120
don't uh

139
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,919
don't worry if like you end up you know

140
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,120
sort of falling behind

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,560
as i'm folding here because we're going

142
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,919
to do it a couple times just so we can

143
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,120
get a hang of it

144
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,319
okay so this is how you fold the

145
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,520
um sono bay module

146
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,440
we start off by folding your square in

147
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,800
half

148
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
so we're gonna fold this in half and

149
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,400
hopefully you can see it

150
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,360
even though i'm using vellum paper um i

151
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
can always switch to the colored paper

152
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,720
later just to make it easy actually why

153
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,960
don't we do that

154
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
sorry to switch papers on you but just

155
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
so you can see

156
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,160
um what the folds that i'm folding um

157
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,080
i'm gonna use this colored paper for you

158
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,240
okay so

159
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,000
let's hold it in half and then open

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,479
it up so now you'll have a crease

161
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,960
in the middle that's your middle point

162
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
and we're going to fold

163
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,400
both halves of the paper into the middle

164
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,680
point

165
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,000
so first you do this

166
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,680
fold it in the middle

167
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,360
and then turn it around and fold

168
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,400
that in the middle

169
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,719
great

170
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,319
and then just open it back up

171
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,560
so now you should have four

172
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,160
equal spaced lines

173
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,720
okay so

174
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
after you make the four equally spaced

175
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,560
lines

176
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,039
you have to pick a corner and it doesn't

177
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,560
matter which corner you're gonna pick

178
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,960
you just have to pick the same corner

179
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,319
every time because we're gonna make a

180
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,360
couple of them

181
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,639
uh and if you pick the other corner for

182
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,039
your

183
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,000
next module uh they're not gonna fit

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,960
together

185
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,319
ask me how i know so

186
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,840
um we're gonna pick this corner because

187
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,160
i've been uh i train myself

188
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,120
to just pick this corner always which is

189
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,520
like

190
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,639
the left hand the right hand one i have

191
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,080
troubles with my left and right

192
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,599
okay um we'll pick this corner and then

193
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,520
you'll pick the opposite corner to fold

194
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,000
so

195
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,199
all i did was fold a triangle from

196
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,960
this corner and then lined it up with

197
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,320
that line

198
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,519
over there the first line

199
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,919
and then turn it around get the kitty

200
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,039
corner

201
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,519
of that paper of that fold that you made

202
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,440
and then do the same thing

203
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,560
triangle following that first crease

204
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,120
okay cool

205
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
and if you did that then you can fold

206
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,880
your paper that that first fold in and

207
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
that last fold in

208
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,080
so you kind of get this shape

209
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,680
this you're back to a rectangle but you

210
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,199
have these little triangle cutouts

211
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,279
all right we're halfway there folks

212
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,279
so after you do that you can

213
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,399
follow this line and you're gonna make

214
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,920
another triangle from this corner

215
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,279
so you can oh um

216
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,440
yeah so i think we're recording this

217
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,640
right now we're definitely going to make

218
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,680
it available

219
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,279
but in the hackaday um

220
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,360
page for this workshop i'll also leave

221
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,560
some instructions

222
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,360
so you can fold along if you like if i

223
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,320
end up going a little bit too fast

224
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,600
yes that okay so we're going to make

225
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,279
another triangle but this time we're

226
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,800
going to follow

227
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,640
this line here to make that triangle

228
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,000
so put the corner and

229
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,279
make it follow the opposite side

230
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,959
there are technical terms for this

231
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,760
for these origami folds but uh we're not

232
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,279
gonna worry about those because we're

233
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,839
just having fun

234
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,279
okay so now you have that triangle and

235
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,360
we're going to follow this line again

236
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,519
to make the other triangle so it's on

237
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,560
the opposite corner of where you

238
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,000
folded your last one

239
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,720
okay

240
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,160
here we go

241
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,440
great so we got to here

242
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,079
and now all we have to do is tuck in

243
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,040
well this is not

244
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,880
this is like second to the last step you

245
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
tuck in these

246
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,680
flaps into

247
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,600
so actually the best way of doing this

248
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,519
is open it back up again

249
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,760
and then tuck this in under

250
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,959
like that so like i'm gonna i'm gonna

251
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,920
try to do it

252
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,200
backwards here so here all i'm doing is

253
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,079
tucking

254
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,160
opening up this flap and then tucking in

255
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,800
this corner

256
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,279
like that okay

257
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,240
oh great oh i see some people holding up

258
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,519
their stuff

259
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,720
i love it yes okay

260
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,360
um all right so that is uh your your

261
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,079
basic

262
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,560
fold um uh we're gonna do one last step

263
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,360
which is

264
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,160
um take these pockets right this pockets

265
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,800
are gonna be your internal

266
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,160
fold like that

267
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,360
and then

268
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,240
we're going to make another triangle

269
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,639
like this

270
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,040
um but we're going to take this sort of

271
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,639
i don't know ear

272
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,360
and fold it over so that it meets this

273
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,079
corner

274
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,359
so folding it over like this

275
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,920
and then we're gonna do we're gonna flip

276
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,040
it over and we're gonna do the same on

277
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,959
the other side

278
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,560
take this triangle and make it into a

279
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,839
smaller triangle

280
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,320
okay now just let it go and then

281
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,800
turn it around and you know you did it

282
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,959
right if the pockets

283
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,959
ended up being inside so like these

284
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,720
pockets should be

285
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,560
inside of your own valley fold there

286
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
okay

287
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,720
and because sometimes you might have

288
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
folded it in

289
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,880
from here so if you don't have pockets

290
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,240
on the inside then you just have to flip

291
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,639
your fold

292
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,600
all right that's actually our first

293
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,720
module

294
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,240
done and all we have to do is make

295
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,440
a few more of these uh

296
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,240
and actually let me get the

297
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,959
the layer of the room here did everyone

298
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,160
get that or should we do

299
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,399
one more one more please

300
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,440
okay let's do one more so i'm gonna do

301
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,160
i'm gonna still use the paper um the

302
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,360
colored paper

303
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,920
let's use another color here we go

304
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,680
here's a great one

305
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,880
um we're going to do it again because

306
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,680
it's a it's a pretty simple fold but if

307
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,199
you want to make stuff with it you're

308
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,320
going to end up making

309
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,600
a little bit more in fact

310
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,120
one of the shapes requires like 30.

311
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,920
we're not going to make 30 today but

312
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,560
we're gonna

313
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,440
um it's it's a it's a good fold to know

314
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,279
okay so we're going to start again with

315
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,959
a square we're going to do half

316
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,880
and then we're going to open it back up

317
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,000
and then we're going gonna fold in

318
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,079
both sides into the center fold

319
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,519
so we're folding this guy and then we're

320
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,880
taking

321
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,040
this other side and putting

322
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,719
that to the center

323
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,320
okay

324
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,399
and then open it back up

325
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,360
and then i'm gonna do one corner

326
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,120
remember if you already made one

327
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,480
pick the same corner um

328
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,600
and then close it back up as a triangle

329
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,519
and then go to the kitty corner and

330
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,240
close that up

331
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,760
i'm gonna flip this over real quick

332
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,399
there we go all right

333
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,959
so you should have something like this

334
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:15,839
after the

335
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,040
four evenly spaced um columns

336
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,959
or rows and then we're gonna fold it in

337
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,160
together back to the center

338
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,279
and hopefully your folds still stay flat

339
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,959
as you do this and if it doesn't

340
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,560
it usually means

341
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,680
if it doesn't it's okay actually um this

342
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,320
fold

343
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,920
the one of the great things that i love

344
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,399
about this fold is it's pretty versatile

345
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,880
or it's pretty forgiving so even if you

346
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,680
kind of like

347
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,839
not make square folds here it's not that

348
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,680
bad okay

349
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,519
and then we're gonna make another

350
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,600
triangle following

351
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,720
this line here so we're gonna

352
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,839
like say

353
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,240
so now we have a fold that sort of

354
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,040
followed

355
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,839
that line and then we're going to do the

356
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,440
same thing on the other side

357
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,839
but we're going to do it the other

358
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,720
direction so take

359
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,160
this corner

360
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,519
and then make a triangle to the other

361
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,360
side

362
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,959
there we go so we got this parallelogram

363
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,119
then we gotta tuck it in so

364
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,560
there we go so tucking it in just means

365
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,240
taking this flap

366
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,120
taking this corner and then pushing it

367
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,040
in there there we go

368
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,040
now we do the same for the other side

369
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,880
there so you have this parallelogram and

370
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,639
then the last step is making it

371
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,839
sort of this curvy mountain valley thing

372
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,559
so take make sure you're folding in

373
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,760
where the pockets are

374
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,760
so fold it in this way

375
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,599
and then you have these little ears and

376
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,359
it's like there's this big right

377
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,199
triangle we're going to turn it into a

378
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,640
smaller

379
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,280
not so right triangle i don't know what

380
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,960
this is an equilateral triangle

381
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,240
there we go and then we fold it

382
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,679
from the other side still a right

383
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,760
triangle

384
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,320
folding it in into this

385
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,720
other triangle but i don't know what the

386
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,280
name is

387
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,559
okay there we go

388
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,240
so that is our other sonobe module

389
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,799
and what's great about these sanobe

390
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,320
modules so we have two

391
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,679
now right um you can

392
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,000
kind of weave them together using these

393
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,200
pockets

394
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,120
so i have this little tippy

395
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,440
i'm gonna insert it into the pocket that

396
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,240
we made earlier

397
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,039
and that's how you kind of weave it

398
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,960
together

399
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,000
i have another one here i'm

400
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,640
cheating um but i just want to show you

401
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,360
uh how i

402
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,120
weave it um so you'll notice that

403
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,160
there's a pocket

404
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,600
here right but this

405
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,720
guy also has a pocket

406
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,919
in the same direction so we're gonna

407
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,039
do we're gonna insert

408
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,799
the tail into that center pocket

409
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,320
but we're also going to take this

410
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,679
other piece the other tail

411
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,679
and slide it at the same time

412
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:11,840
into the other pocket

413
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,360
so like we're kind of weaving everything

414
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,679
together

415
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,600
and i'm gonna just

416
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,720
nudge and force and coerce this paper

417
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,160
into this pyramid

418
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,440
and the cool thing so that's like one of

419
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,640
the this is like

420
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,120
how you would weave these together and

421
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,240
from here

422
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,480
you can actually make a bunch of things

423
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,280
so let me show you

424
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,799
so like from that weave that we just did

425
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,720
we can do you know using

426
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,120
many different numbers of these modules

427
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,240
we can make this

428
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,360
small pyramid one we can make cube we

429
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,240
can make an

430
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,799
octahedron and we can make an

431
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,440
icosahedron

432
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,600
as well like all the stellated versions

433
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,880
of those

434
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,880
um and so let me show you

435
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,919
and and just this pyramid that we made

436
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,480
with the three

437
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,320
is actually uh pretty good at diffusing

438
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,120
light already

439
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,280
so i'm gonna take i have these uh these

440
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,880
are made from the vellum paper that i

441
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,240
listed in the workshop materials

442
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,320
and i'm gonna do the same weave so i'm

443
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,799
gonna show that again

444
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,840
there's a pocket in here and there's a

445
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,400
tail

446
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,120
and i gotta slide it in there

447
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,919
and i'm left with a pocket here and a

448
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:42,799
tail here

449
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,240
hello now we're gonna make uh

450
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,360
we're gonna take this other uh

451
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,840
sauna by piece we're gonna slide it into

452
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,280
that pocket

453
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,480
but also take that tail

454
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,840
and slide that tail into

455
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,200
the new pocket

456
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
now i'm just gonna sort of push

457
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,080
everything together

458
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,440
and that's like your your little pyramid

459
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,360
module and this

460
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,640
can actually already diffuse light

461
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,120
quite well you see

462
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,799
and you get some little hot spots if

463
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,159
you're not careful

464
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,760
the thing that the thing about leds is

465
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,760
it's all about sort of getting the light

466
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,240
to bounce around as much as you can

467
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,799
so just avoiding hot spots means just

468
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,559
don't point

469
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,600
the led directly at a wall

470
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,600
side light is much better and

471
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,480
actually if you go back to this view

472
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,679
this

473
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,960
pyramid is uh what is made up

474
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,480
of what makes up this entire wall art

475
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,440
here

476
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,919
so you can see that only some of them

477
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:06,880
light up

478
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,799
but that's because i only made some of

479
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,240
them this vellum

480
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,240
paper thing um and but all of them are

481
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,120
just

482
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,480
this pyramid so you can actually make

483
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,679
quite massive uh shapes with just

484
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,880
the this one folding technique

485
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,039
and because it's a sheep right so

486
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,960
earlier i showed you

487
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,799
that you can make all of these sort of

488
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,640
regular solids

489
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,120
um a cube and a cosahedron an octahedron

490
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,000
and i'll leave

491
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,200
um directions for folding these shapes

492
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,400
in that making glowy origami hackaday

493
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,600
page as well

494
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,280
but because you can kind of weave them

495
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,679
all

496
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,640
into a sheet like this then you have

497
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,159
kind of more options than just those

498
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,679
regular solids right like you can

499
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,480
imagine

500
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,720
wrap like making an entire sheet of this

501
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,679
and then wrapping it

502
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,960
around a shape like a cylinder or like a

503
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,240
a wavy surface um whatever whatever your

504
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,200
heart desires

505
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,440
so like i re that's why i really like

506
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,480
this fold

507
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,360
because it's very versatile and in fact

508
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,320
so like

509
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,880
so this is like the sheet of them and

510
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,280
the lights up here

511
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,720
are um the same folds they're just

512
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,799
the the regular solid version

513
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,080
of these sauna bay modules um

514
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,039
and if you've seen this project on

515
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:31,760
twitter before

516
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,960
it's like a it's a clock um sophie wong

517
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,039
once called it a chromatic

518
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,240
chronometer which i thought was a really

519
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,360
cool name

520
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,159
um but yeah right now it's just um in

521
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,520
its friday mode

522
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,520
so it's blinking random uh lights there

523
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,000
but yeah it's like i made a clock and i

524
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,080
made a wall art and it's the same

525
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,120
sort of folding technique

526
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,320
okay wow we're like halfway through all

527
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,039
right

528
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,320
um i hope you guys like that one

529
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,919
uh i think it's time to move on to

530
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,919
something else um

531
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,960
i was gonna show you that well

532
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,840
let's think about this yeah let's make

533
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,159
this fold and then i have some like

534
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,480
i have some like cool stuff to show you

535
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,000
on slides too

536
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,039
so our next fold is gonna be a little

537
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,720
bit less

538
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,919
um it's a little bit more free form

539
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,000
ish um and not so

540
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
there isn't like really set steps to it

541
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,440
but

542
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,400
um take any piece of paper and make it

543
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,240
into a long rectangle

544
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,520
so like this one is um

545
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
literally just like an arbitrary piece

546
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,440
of like rectangle paper

547
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,840
um i don't know how long i made this one

548
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,679
let me see

549
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,200
this one is uh two and a half inches

550
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,480
but it doesn't have to be two and a half

551
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,880
inches it just has to be sort of

552
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,840
long like this

553
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,400
so take that paper fold it

554
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,799
uh or cut like a long rectangle piece

555
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,520
and it doesn't even have to be super

556
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,080
long anyway

557
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,400
um what we're going to do is we're going

558
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,960
to do the same kind of thing

559
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,000
as before in terms of folding in half

560
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,840
so we're going to fold it in half like

561
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,400
this

562
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,840
and the thing that i'm going to show you

563
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,600
actually maybe it's a surprise

564
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,919
yeah let's do that let's make it a

565
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,000
surprise what you're going to fold

566
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,720
so fold this in half and then we're

567
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
going to do sort of an alternating

568
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,039
mountain valley fold

569
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,080
so take the top piece of your half

570
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:57,840
and fold it back like this

571
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,919
okay and then take this bottom part and

572
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,279
fold it the other way so i'm going to

573
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,440
flip it

574
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,360
and then i'm gonna hold it back

575
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,199
and then you'll end up with sort of a

576
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,320
uh i think it's called a constantino

577
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,200
fold

578
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,440
it's like alternating mountain valley

579
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,240
fold

580
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
maybe that's just me maybe that was like

581
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,640
what somebody told me when i was a kid

582
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,400
but anyway you end up with like

583
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,600
this type of a thing and

584
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,159
what i'm going to show you is a really

585
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,279
versatile

586
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,279
fold that you can kind of play around

587
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,799
with called a v

588
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,600
fold and you'll see why it's a v it's a

589
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,640
in a second so

590
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,159
so compress your um constantina fold

591
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,000
down again

592
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,440
and then fold pick any like length

593
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,559
here and then fold this

594
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,080
strip back into an angle

595
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,600
if you can make it like greater than 45

596
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,559
degree angle

597
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,520
like that that would be great 45 degree

598
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,840
is fine too

599
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,039
um and by that angle i mean like

600
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,240
this inner one you know like it's kind

601
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,120
of bigger

602
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,720
than the 90 degrees the inner one

603
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,559
is oh my god what is geometry okay

604
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,640
um so do a fold like that and then

605
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,919
just for good measure reverse that

606
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,919
crease that you just need

607
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,520
just so you get like a really crisp

608
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,240
fold there because we're gonna open it

609
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,720
back up

610
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,840
and hopefully you can see but there's

611
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
this v

612
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,320
well they kind of look like a's but

613
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,120
there's

614
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,240
uh this v folds that appear when you

615
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,559
open it back up

616
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,279
and what we're going to do is this

617
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,960
zigzag line

618
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,559
we're going to reverse um the mountain

619
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,200
fold and the valley fold

620
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,919
on on one side of the line so like if if

621
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,840
in your longer piece

622
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,120
it's a valley fold then this piece here

623
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,480
after the zigzag will end up being

624
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,760
a mountain fold

625
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,159
so like that's that

626
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,840
and then

627
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,760
and then this guy is a mountain fold

628
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,200
right so it's going to end up being a

629
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
valley

630
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,159
and when i say mountain and valley i

631
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,000
just mean you know if it's like

632
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,399
a fold that's like this or a fold that's

633
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,480
nice

634
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,039
and then as you do that you'll actually

635
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,480
start to realize that

636
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,120
the paper will want to it's a little

637
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,080
finicky

638
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,919
um so don't don't uh stress too much if

639
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,480
if this becomes a little bit finicky

640
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,440
when you're trying it

641
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,760
but maybe i'm telling myself that but

642
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,360
it will end up wanting there we go

643
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,039
it will end up wanting to follow

644
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,399
that v-fold so now i can kind of

645
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,918
compress it together this way

646
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,960
and then i can kind of follow that same

647
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,320
logic here so i'm going to reverse that

648
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,440
fold

649
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,120
make sure that the v-fold is followed

650
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,399
and then just kind of

651
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,760
coerce that paper

652
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,960
and then you kind of end up with what

653
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
you started before except that all the

654
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,919
folds are reversed

655
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,600
like that so you end up with this like v

656
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,919
yeah yeah i can see that that's

657
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,440
beautiful

658
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,880
nice i can see you guys creations

659
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,320
they're all nice

660
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,960
so okay this is like an interesting one

661
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,640
because you can

662
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,919
now play around like all we did was

663
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,320
create a crease that was diagonal and

664
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,200
then sort of

665
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
did that reverse mountain valley thing

666
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,080
and then follow the v um

667
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,840
and then you can kind of create a bunch

668
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,640
of different shapes so like

669
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,679
this is a sample it's a little finicky

670
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,840
to do live so i made this um ahead of

671
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,720
time but

672
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,000
if you stack those v's you end up with

673
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,200
this like really interesting surface

674
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,279
um if you reverse them then you kind of

675
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,480
end up

676
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,600
with these diagonal shapes right

677
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,679
and then if you make a bunch of them

678
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,279
like this

679
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,720
this is like a really interesting

680
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,240
flexible structure now right like

681
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,880
this is like

682
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,039
yeah yeah very gothic cathedral i like

683
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,000
that

684
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,919
so like you can kind of play around with

685
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,919
i don't know making it

686
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,840
into shapes like this if you do two of

687
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,240
these then you've kind of just made this

688
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,840
gem type of a deal

689
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,480
i've even seen you know if you flip it

690
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,559
and then you can like

691
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,600
kind of do this kind of a shape

692
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,799
right and the great thing about this

693
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,840
is i'm going to turn this off

694
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,440
is it actually

695
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,200
because it's just one layer of paper

696
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,720
right it takes color really well and

697
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,559
like this is just white paper

698
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,240
um i haven't tried it with the vellum

699
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,000
yet but you kind of will get the same

700
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,679
effect i think so like it would be

701
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,360
it would end up really interesting

702
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,200
shapes and you can kind of like

703
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,039
really play around with making more of

704
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,399
these like v folds

705
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,600
and what's really cool is there's

706
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,080
actually

707
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,000
i found some like cool buildings oh

708
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,880
where did it go

709
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,080
this guy like that's kind of the similar

710
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,240
sort of like it's very reminiscent of

711
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,320
that fold that we just did

712
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,559
um and i think it's just kind of

713
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,039
fascinating how

714
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,080
this sort of idea that you can you can

715
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,200
make simple folds

716
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,720
and then you end up with this like

717
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,679
really cool structure at the end of it

718
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,320
it's just really awesome and then the

719
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,360
other thing to note

720
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,200
about this i'm gonna turn this light

721
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,480
back on

722
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,039
the other thing to note is that you know

723
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,679
now that you've made this fold

724
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,840
we've actually just turned a little bit

725
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,360
zoom in there we go we've

726
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,480
turned sort of like

727
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,320
this big surface area

728
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,039
which is like i think this is like an

729
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,120
entire letter-sized piece of paper

730
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,519
i've just turned it into something that

731
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,919
i can compress

732
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,240
into something really small right and it

733
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,640
turns out that that quality

734
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,960
ends up being really important in terms

735
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,440
of um

736
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,679
uh engineering problems and i know we're

737
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,799
kind of running

738
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,440
out of time here but let me fly through

739
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,000
some of these

740
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,600
examples so like

741
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,640
for example there's like a solar uh it's

742
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,720
called the japanese space flier

743
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,240
and it had to have solar arrays right

744
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,960
and they had to figure out how to um

745
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,760
deploy the satellite with with the solar

746
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,440
array being collapsed and then unfolded

747
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,399
in space

748
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,640
so this is kind of the mechanism that

749
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,480
they came up with

750
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,120
and turns out maps some like do you guys

751
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,360
know maps not google maps but like

752
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,320
the paper maps that people used to use

753
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,880
were apparently folded this way too

754
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,080
so like let me show you like this

755
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,679
kind of a thing where because it's

756
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,560
compressible

757
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,560
and you can kind of unfold it with one

758
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
motion it ends up being

759
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,480
really really useful in

760
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,918
in a bunch of uh engineering problems

761
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,560
it's like here's another example

762
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,239
um we've got star shade which is maybe

763
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,560
like

764
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,399
more a more recent one i don't know if

765
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,159
they actually were able to deploy this

766
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:30,719
guy yet

767
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,879
but it's meant to like sort of be a

768
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,719
shade for

769
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,760
um for for taking photos right because

770
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,119
you want to be able to take photos of

771
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,239
planets without

772
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,879
the the solar system sun getting in the

773
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:43,520
way

774
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,760
so and that mechanism is also sort of

775
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,879
this folded one

776
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,320
and we're not gonna get to the star

777
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,000
shade model today but

778
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,040
it's actually in that hack day origami

779
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,918
um the making origami hackaday page that

780
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,240
you can see

781
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,160
um and then you know the same sort of

782
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,400
concept of being able to shrink material

783
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,320
down and then deploy it as usual also

784
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,480
makes it really useful for things like

785
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,079
medicine or surgery surgical tools where

786
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:12,960
you have to like

787
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,160
make really small things to to insert

788
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,839
into a person's body and you won't have

789
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:18,800
to

790
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,839
um and then you can kind of deploy it uh

791
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,200
when it gets to its destination

792
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,400
okay um wow those holes actually ended

793
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,079
up taking a little bit longer

794
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,720
than i expected um this is another one

795
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,280
of the

796
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,800
let me show you one last thing this is

797
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,520
like the same sort of fold but i just

798
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,960
like made it massive

799
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,480
right so it's a really interesting um

800
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,680
yeah yeah i think so robert lang is like

801
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,240
a pretty

802
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,119
um popular sort of origami artist he's

803
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,880
been doing it for a long time

804
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,119
okay um so actually no are actually

805
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,160
we're actually right

806
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,480
at we're four but i think this workshop

807
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
is until 4 30. so we have some time

808
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,839
okay great um

809
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,680
and as a uh

810
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,640
so now that we've kind of like seen some

811
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,560
examples of how you can

812
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,079
sort of make some origami that you can

813
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,760
compress i thought it would be really

814
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,440
interesting to see

815
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,800
a more complicated one so has anyone

816
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,880
has everyone printed this out i put it

817
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,520
in the workshop material

818
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,040
but this is like a folding uh pattern

819
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,800
yeah okay i see some people holding it

820
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,720
up great great

821
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,720
awesome awesome

822
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,560
okay so we're gonna try and fold this we

823
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,920
actually have a lot of time

824
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,560
so uh i was like i was really panicking

825
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,680
i thought that we didn't have a lot of

826
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,320
time

827
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,119
okay so we're gonna i'm gonna take a

828
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:49,599
scissor

829
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,280
actually i have scissors right here and

830
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,560
what we're gonna do is we're gonna cut

831
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,599
we're going to cut this outline out

832
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,280
so the entire parallelogram we're going

833
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,960
to cut it out and i'm going to show you

834
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,400
what we'll end up with we're going to

835
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,240
end up with this guy

836
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,040
so it's like a cylinder but it's using a

837
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,240
very similar

838
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,440
sort of um very similar concept

839
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,359
to how uh yes i haven't actually

840
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,359
seen that but origami tessellations by

841
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,839
eric

842
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,640
yeah yeah i'm gonna pretend like that

843
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,480
was the correct way of pronouncing that

844
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,359
um but yeah check check that sounds like

845
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,000
a good book

846
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,880
check it out friends um yeah so this

847
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,640
we're gonna make this like tessellated

848
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,680
cylinder surface um another thing and

849
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,720
like since we're in

850
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,200
topic of book recommendations here

851
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,720
there's one

852
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,480
from uh paul jackson which is called

853
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,359
folding techniques for designers and

854
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,079
this is actually

855
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,359
where i got this v fold from

856
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,839
is from this book it's a great book yes

857
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,560
definitely i did not know that there

858
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,240
were so many types of pleats

859
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,760
until i read that book it's great okay

860
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,800
so we're gonna cut this up and

861
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,320
i'm gonna do some live cutting again i

862
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,720
honestly did not anticipate that i was

863
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,160
gonna do so much love cutting know

864
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,560
sometimes you just learn

865
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,560
things by doing it live

866
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,720
is this asmr does this this is

867
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,800
is this like really satisfying to hear

868
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,040
right

869
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,760
okay i'm gonna stop maybe that's like

870
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,240
annoying

871
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,079
so we're going to cut cut that

872
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,720
parallelogram

873
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,359
here

874
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,839
and then cut it up again

875
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,839
there we go

876
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,000
okay

877
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,240
so um the idea

878
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,200
is that we're going to fold all of the

879
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,320
black lines

880
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,880
in one direction and all of the red

881
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,440
lines in the opposite direction

882
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,200
so in this case what we're going to do

883
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,880
is we're going to fold

884
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,079
all of the black lines in inwards

885
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,119
like so that we sort of make a cylinder

886
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,520
uh inwards with the black lines and then

887
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,960
with the red lines we're going to fold

888
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,760
it

889
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,119
outwards so let me just get started and

890
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,240
show you

891
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,440
um for this i think i'm gonna

892
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,560
i'm just gonna wing it you can use a few

893
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,599
things

894
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,839
like you know i have this little bone

895
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,040
folder

896
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,599
but you can use a pencil or you can use

897
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,079
like

898
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,520
you know any sort of blunt instrument

899
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,200
to to sort of guide you here but

900
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,800
you can kind of score i've seen people

901
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,119
too

902
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,800
like sort of score it on

903
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,760
soft paper first or like a soft surface

904
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,160
and then

905
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,160
try to fold it that way um

906
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,400
but yeah whatever whatever works for you

907
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,160
this is going to be a little bit more of

908
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,839
a

909
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,040
more of a challenge i guess so like now

910
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,560
that i folded this first one

911
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,040
i'm going to fold the other one and i'm

912
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,680
just going to keep it open

913
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,880
and then fold

914
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,040
this guy over

915
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,119
you can kind of get away with just like

916
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,440
peeking

917
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,040
peeking at it

918
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,440
and you can kind of know that you're

919
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,839
good

920
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,720
by if your copy paper is sort of like

921
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,440
not

922
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,400
uh you know if it's not thick then you

923
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,359
can see

924
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,400
these lines anyway so use

925
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,800
all of those tricks to sort of follow

926
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,599
those lines

927
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,040
and while i'm here

928
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,280
that ballpoint pen with a ruler is good

929
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,319
for scoring

930
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,880
yeah definitely a good idea

931
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,280
i'm gonna i'm gonna do something

932
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,839
hopefully it's not too bad

933
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,560
can you guys hear this music

934
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,710
[Music]

935
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,359
maybe actually no just kidding here we

936
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,839
go

937
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,480
can you guys hear that

938
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,160
okay great let me know if it becomes

939
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,160
annoying but i'm just gonna play this

940
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,680
music while we fold

941
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,839
so

942
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:31,839
we're gonna do this guy here

943
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,440
yeah you definitely need that desk space

944
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,720
okay

945
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,480
at some point maybe it's better to like

946
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:59,839
turn it around

947
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
uh

948
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,839
baby

949
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,839
do

950
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:06,328
[Music]

951
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
do

952
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:20,949
[Music]

953
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,589
[Music]

954
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:44,529
[Music]

955
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,839
uh

956
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,839
my

957
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,130
[Music]

958
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,839
so

959
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:55,479
[Music]

960
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,040
okay so now i'm in oh nice people are

961
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,000
getting there

962
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,359
all right so now i'm in the red folds

963
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,839
i had to turn off uh the music while i'm

964
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,520
talking because apparently it

965
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,240
interacts with zoom audio really badly

966
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,520
so i didn't want you to have a bad

967
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,960
experience

968
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,440
um but yeah all i'm doing right now so

969
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,480
if you folded it

970
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,680
all inwards all of the black lines

971
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,200
inwards

972
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,319
now we're going to fold

973
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,960
sorry one sec where's my

974
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:35,280
oh dear hello can you guys still hear me

975
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,319
there we go okay great um

976
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,440
yeah so now i'm getting

977
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,599
the reverse folds which is just the red

978
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,960
ones and these are

979
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,920
a little bit easier because you kind of

980
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,560
just have to

981
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,680
fold it outward and then we'll look for

982
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,000
that

983
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,160
red line so like what i'm doing is

984
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,280
folding it until i see the red line

985
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,240
and then i just kind of follow that red

986
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,359
line

987
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,839
as i'm revealing it

988
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,400
like that cool

989
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,240
so now you can just keep going

990
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,839
and this is the last stretch of this

991
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,200
know people were liking the music

992
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,960
but maybe i'll stick around later

993
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,680
and then we can play some more jazzy

994
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,839
jesse origami

995
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,200
there we go

996
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:53,839
and then just continue to fold

997
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,040
your red lines outward

998
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,920
and it's about to get real exciting okay

999
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,400
maybe not that exciting

1000
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,839
but definitely at least a little bit

1001
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,839
exciting

1002
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,760
there we go

1003
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:35,200
all right is everyone having

1004
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,520
much luck with their stuff i've got this

1005
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,240
this down

1006
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,680
there we go got all my creases in

1007
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,240
i'm not gonna promise that these creases

1008
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,000
are perfect

1009
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,520
but i'm gonna guess that they're gonna

1010
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,160
be good enough

1011
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,480
okay

1012
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,400
so don't worry if you're still in the

1013
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,079
middle of holding

1014
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,880
uh and i'm definitely gonna we're

1015
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,240
recording this so it's not like we're

1016
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,920
gonna miss anything

1017
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,319
but what we're gonna do is we're gonna

1018
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:13,040
start

1019
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,880
to sculpt this creased

1020
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,960
bit of parallelogram into a cylinder

1021
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,000
and the way we do that

1022
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,520
well start to notice first that

1023
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,960
if you flip your paper over

1024
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,400
these creases will kind of

1025
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,599
want they will cut the paper will kind

1026
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:37,920
of

1027
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,920
want to compress already

1028
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,119
especially if you have like

1029
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,440
you know pretty sharp creases

1030
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,599
come on paper don't embarrass me

1031
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,960
there we go see like you can kind of

1032
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,880
already sort of coerce that paper into

1033
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,559
those shapes so push

1034
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,359
push it from the sides and if you see

1035
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,400
things like this

1036
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,160
just pop them out

1037
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,920
and then sort of just

1038
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,760
let the paper fold into the shape that

1039
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,040
it's already creased in

1040
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,960
and you're not going to get it to to

1041
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,000
crease into a cylinder immediately

1042
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,280
but you can at least sort of encourage

1043
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,400
it

1044
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,920
this way and you can already see i mean

1045
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,680
like this is a really interesting

1046
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,160
surface

1047
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,920
already it's like a it's like just the

1048
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,000
finer version

1049
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,760
of what we had earlier with the v-folds

1050
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,800
okay so after you're

1051
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,880
you might not get that crease

1052
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,000
immediately

1053
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,319
or you might not get you know all these

1054
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,599
folds to crease as much but now you can

1055
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,599
kind of see how it's going to turn into

1056
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,520
a cylinder

1057
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,599
and this is something that i always sort

1058
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,680
of

1059
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,000
have to struggle with a little bit so

1060
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,280
like

1061
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,559
go ahead it goes

1062
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:23,839
like

1063
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,680
[Music]

1064
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,119
so it's gonna sort of like this corner

1065
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,559
is sort of going to meet with the other

1066
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:39,760
corner of the power

1067
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,800
parallelogram as long as you're sort of

1068
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,839
creasing it that way

1069
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,839
and then this corner will meet with this

1070
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,559
corner

1071
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,359
so it's going to end up being a smaller

1072
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,160
thing

1073
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:05,760
that you maybe first anticipated

1074
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,559
somebody was saying

1075
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,800
yeah this this right now is just regular

1076
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,839
office paper

1077
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,359
the vellum um i was suggesting to use

1078
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,880
for the sonobit modules

1079
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,839
okay so like if you kind of just

1080
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,559
encourage it

1081
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,839
you're gonna find

1082
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:46,640
but it's gonna wanna

1083
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,160
sort of hug itself you see that

1084
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,000
it's like sort of a hug

1085
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,319
and then you might

1086
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,520
take a little bit more coercion than

1087
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,079
than you expected but don't be afraid to

1088
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,160
sort of just crush crush crush the paper

1089
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,558
until you get it to a point

1090
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,820
where it

1091
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,920
[Music]

1092
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,880
collapses

1093
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,400
like this yeah and then all of the

1094
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,000
little pleats should sort of line

1095
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,079
up

1096
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,599
like this okay

1097
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,839
hopefully i mean like this is this is

1098
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:42,400
like

1099
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,240
i i got to this by just sort of

1100
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,240
letting the paper follow the creases

1101
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,839
um and that's kind of why it was

1102
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,599
important to follow this pattern is

1103
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:54,240
because

1104
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,200
otherwise it wouldn't fold into a

1105
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,800
cylinder like this

1106
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,040
if we didn't have sort of a

1107
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,800
predetermined fold pattern

1108
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,200
already

1109
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,480
so now you have that and then you can

1110
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,520
kind of um

1111
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,800
glue i know a lot of origami people

1112
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,240
don't like to glue things but

1113
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,359
this one is meant to be glued um you can

1114
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,040
kind of glue

1115
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,240
the the seam there and you end up

1116
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,559
with this guy this sort of thing

1117
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,960
and this is really cool because it

1118
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,920
compresses

1119
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,760
and i'm pretty sure i've also seen a

1120
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,920
lamp that looks like this

1121
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,760
and i need a slightly bigger version

1122
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,240
of it i actually didn't have a printer

1123
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,599
that could print on 11x17 so i just

1124
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:48,240
um did the drew this on a qriket maker

1125
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,760
so like you can see that there's like

1126
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,920
these golden lines here that i just

1127
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,880
followed

1128
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,160
and this is actually also a vellum paper

1129
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,119
it's like slightly

1130
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,599
thicker vellum paper and this just

1131
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:00,480
happens

1132
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,119
i'll turn this off this just happens to

1133
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,558
be a really good

1134
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,319
like vessel for light

1135
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:15,920
um especially if you were using two leds

1136
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,000
just the little surfaces i think make it

1137
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,799
really interesting

1138
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:24,880
and you know it ends up being

1139
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,000
a really sort of uh

1140
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,280
uh interesting material

1141
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,760
to or an interesting fold to sort of

1142
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,480
extend

1143
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,760
and play around with so like one of the

1144
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,040
things that i tried

1145
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,040
is maybe i glued like

1146
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,559
this is not this is not like uh

1147
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,559
it's not gonna collapse into a cylinder

1148
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,640
but i glued basically like

1149
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,240
if you can see there's like the same

1150
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,760
parallelograms i just glued them

1151
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,760
together

1152
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,280
oh okay yeah um yeah so

1153
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,799
this is like a really interesting one

1154
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:04,319
you can even make it longer if you make

1155
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,079
like multiple ones

1156
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,480
um and now that you can compress it i

1157
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,640
could see people sort of making

1158
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,480
uh i don't know portable lamps this way

1159
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,440
portable camping lamps maybe

1160
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,960
um so yeah that's it that's actually a

1161
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,920
really um

1162
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,960
challenging fold you guys a candelabra

1163
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,760
bulb

1164
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,960
probably um i could also see it if you

1165
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,440
make it

1166
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,599
small enough you can maybe even like do

1167
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,599
string lights with it

1168
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,720
i think it's kind of cool um

1169
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,520
yeah that's it you guys just like went

1170
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,280
through that entire fold and it's

1171
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,480
actually kind of

1172
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,599
a really involved one

1173
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,960
so thanks for staying with us on it

1174
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,000
um yeah that's it those are the three

1175
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,680
folds let me just uh

1176
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,160
summarize here we made this cylinder

1177
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,119
thing

1178
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,319
and then we played around a little bit

1179
00:56:58,319 --> 00:56:59,119
with these

1180
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,160
uh v folds right

1181
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,880
and then we also made some sonoma

1182
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,760
modules

1183
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,040
like this which you can turn into these

1184
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,559
regular solids which i'll

1185
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,079
uh give a link in the project page as

1186
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:14,960
well

1187
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,119
so yeah those are some ways to make some

1188
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:18,319
glowy origami

1189
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,720
i hope you enjoyed that i also hope you

1190
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,319
enjoyed these leds

1191
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,319
because these are my favorite leds

1192
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,559
especially because they're diffused

1193
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,200
themselves so they make really great

1194
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,960
sort of if if you're not using them for

1195
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,400
the final project

1196
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,359
they make great test leds because they

1197
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,119
they cycle through all the colors

1198
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,440
and if you wanted to see how a certain

1199
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,599
color reacts with a certain

1200
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,680
um bit of paper then you can kind of

1201
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,920
like use this to play around with it

1202
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,400
they come in like three millimeter

1203
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,839
packages as well so like

1204
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,160
right now right now i'm using this like

1205
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,000
five millimeter one but they also

1206
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,640
come in this like where's my camera

1207
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,359
there we go

1208
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,960
it's like a smaller three millimeter one

1209
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,119
as well and all of this is like you can

1210
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,839
get them on amazon it's great

1211
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:09,040
