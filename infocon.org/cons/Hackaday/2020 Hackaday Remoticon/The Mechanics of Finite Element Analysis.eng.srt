[Music]

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,840
so i'm ramen and i'm here to sort of

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,160
really go from the basics to sort of

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,960
really

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,880
go into how you can get an analytical

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,560
understanding of the things that you're

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,440
making

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,520
so sort of like you know first go from

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,720
like the

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
very basics of like you know what the

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,080
forces would be

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
and how you can really analyze that and

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,480
see what is the impact of those forces

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,080
and then really working to how you can

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,399
translate that knowledge into

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,239
uh an fe environment where you'd

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,160
actually be able to simulate that

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
and sort of you know understand the

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,079
different processes required

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,360
to simulate it now right now

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
this is actually it doesn't require any

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,559
software because

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,840
uh this is sort of like you know

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
teaching you the universal

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
uh things that are involved in faa

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,559
and it's sort of like you know going

27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,039
through uh being able to sort of build

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,239
that intuition for

29
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,239
you know why certain things are strong

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,239
and why certain things are weak

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,080
and i think sort of like the whole the

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,760
theme for this whole thing

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
is if i could sum it up in one word it

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,119
would probably be jugaad

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,760
and that's a very indian term but it's

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,799
basically sort of

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,200
you know using the things around you in

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,720
an unintended way

39
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,280
to sort of make stuff and that's

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,119
basically sort of what's happened here

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,360
so i've uh like i have a lot of

42
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
demonstrations here my tables just

43
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,119
filled with them and i'm really excited

44
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,400
to show them all to you

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,640
and i hope and the thing is that they're

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,720
all very simple to do they just lean out

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,280
of stuff

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,880
which you can find lying around at home

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
most of these are just like paper and

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,520
tape

51
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,000
and the idea is that you know you guys

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,119
can also make these

53
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,119
and it just becomes so much more

54
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,720
interesting when you can see this kind

55
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,399
of stuff from yourself rather than just

56
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:46,960
you know

57
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,880
like if you're reading it somewhere or

58
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,479
if you're just seeing someone else do it

59
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,079
so i think now i'll sort of

60
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,560
that's basically a brief of what's going

61
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,079
to be covered

62
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,280
and now i'll sort of just start so

63
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,479
i think to start off with i have

64
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,758
an interesting image so

65
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,680
i have i have this over here

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,480
and this is sort of it was a slight name

67
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,520
on reddit for a while

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
uh it was the string is held up by

69
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
constant stress

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,959
now this this sort of looks like one of

71
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,680
those uh you know physics bending things

72
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
but it is very real and i will prove

73
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,440
that later

74
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,920
and so i think does anyone sort of have

75
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,959
any guess for

76
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,840
like how this might work any sort of

77
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,680
theories any ideas that may come to mind

78
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:51,839
but i think

79
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,200
i think everyone's can people unmute

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,480
themselves

81
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,280
yeah you can like honestly any like this

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,760
is really anyone's guess

83
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,519
that's sort of the whole point of this

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,200
just see what

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,360
what all we could maybe think about yeah

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,760
exactly

87
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
i believe anyone should be able to

88
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,879
unmute themselves so feel free

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,840
if you can't let me know

90
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
yeah i'll just give it a minute

91
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,799
otherwise i'll sort of

92
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,200
go through like a simple example and

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,440
then

94
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,280
see how that can sort of be moved up to

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,519
this

96
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,640
so i think um so to start off with uh

97
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,680
let me just

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,159
see um is everyone able to sort of see

99
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,840
the video in here

100
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,280
where i'm sort of showing a piece of

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
paper and there's uh donald duck

102
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
ruler like

103
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,400
i can see it all right okay great

104
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,799
so over here i'm sort of showing uh

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,840
going to show like a

106
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,159
much simpler version of this so if you

107
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,360
can see here

108
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,720
i have what is basically a piece of

109
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,159
string

110
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,519
all right and over here i have a ruler

111
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,120
now what's interesting about this ruler

112
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,640
is that it's quite elastic

113
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,400
so if i sort of pull it back and i let

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,399
go it's going to spring back

115
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,560
now what's interesting is that if i pull

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
it back

117
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,240
and i bring this over here and sort of

118
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,080
i've done a knot here so that it doesn't

119
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,199
just release

120
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
you can see over here i have this thing

121
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,800
kept up and from the bottom

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,440
i can hold it and the string is stopped

123
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,800
so what's happening is that this is

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,560
constantly pushing out

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,199
whereas with the string that's obviously

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,240
overcoming gravity

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,479
so the string is sort of just the being

128
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,520
kept straight up

129
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,800
by that so this

130
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,120
i think looks sort of familiar to what

131
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,160
you guys might see

132
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,800
as a bow and arrow and this is exactly

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
how it's done so you sort of have

134
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,880
a piece of string along a piece of wood

135
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
it's pulling on it

136
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,919
and it's that's how it's kept on and

137
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,680
that's how you can sort of use that to

138
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
shoot

139
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,840
now this is really sort of that just

140
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,080
stacked multiple times and luckily for

141
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,320
you guys i'm good enough to make that

142
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
so you can actually see it over here

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,759
let me see i think it might be better it

144
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,320
might be more visible in my main thing

145
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,600
so awesome sort of

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,039
like that so if you can see

147
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,280
i've sort of created with these plastic

148
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,039
pieces each one is sort of trying to

149
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,000
push outwards

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
and over there they've used knots we

151
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,280
have these toothpicks just to

152
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,199
because knots ended up getting quite

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,520
fidgety but essentially what this does

154
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,600
is it sort of prevents it from going any

155
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,240
further

156
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,080
so you constantly have each one of these

157
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,280
pushing it up

158
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,720
and since the string so strings have

159
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
very good tensile stress which means

160
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,039
they can

161
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,560
sort of be pulled quite easily but they

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,080
have very low compressiveness that's why

163
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,680
it just falls if you keep it up

164
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
but in this case every thing sort of

165
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,120
pushing it up so it's constantly under

166
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,080
10 cell stress

167
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,120
and that's how this stands so that's

168
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,639
that's sort of like you know the kind of

169
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,400
stuff which i want to

170
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,440
go through uh with this

171
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,319
and sort of go through like you know all

172
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,199
of these

173
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,319
uh different ways to show things

174
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,440
so let me just spot like this video

175
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,520
all right so now sort of to the

176
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,360
uh part which i was talking about so you

177
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,759
have your tensile forces now that is

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,919
sort of like me pulling on this

179
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,520
you can see it's quite strong nothing's

180
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,000
really happening compressive forces are

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,479
like let's say me pushing on this

182
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,360
again it's quite strong nothing's really

183
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,319
happening

184
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,120
so these are sort of your normal forces

185
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,759
and then

186
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,919
you also have shear forces and shear

187
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,520
forces is

188
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,400
sort of like me doing this and you can

189
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,880
see it ends up breaking so that is

190
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,639
uh that is sort of something quite

191
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,000
interesting to look at

192
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,880
and now we'll sort of work on a

193
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,680
mathematical

194
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,759
understanding of that and how you can

195
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,080
really translate that into simulations

196
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,120
but i think before that i sort of have

197
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,639
cured a triangle and here

198
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,000
i have a square now i think

199
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,520
a lot of you guys would know if i have

200
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,120
to say which shape is the stronger shape

201
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
which one would you guys see

202
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,400
uh you can just sort of tap out the

203
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,599
unseen chat

204
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,759
this is sort of like your triangle

205
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,960
triangle yeah yeah exactly it is it is

206
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,319
definitely the triangle

207
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,440
but i think would anyone know why it's

208
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,840
the triangle

209
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,800
it it it's kind of a resistance

210
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,160
to uh to creating moments that can kind

211
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
of bend it

212
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,440
they all resemble in the same point

213
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
yeah that's that's quite good so yeah it

214
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,520
sort of comes down to where your forces

215
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,080
are

216
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,160
so you'll sort of see with this i can

217
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
actually sort of when i push on this the

218
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,520
whole thing can turn

219
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,919
whereas over here when i push on it

220
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,680
nothing really happens all of the force

221
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
is sort of being directed along the

222
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,080
beams

223
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,400
whereas over here it can be directed

224
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,080
along one of the diagonals where there

225
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,960
is no beam

226
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,479
and that's why you have that the

227
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,400
triangle is always the strongest shape

228
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
because there is i can't make any

229
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,759
connections to the corners without it

230
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,960
crossing a beam

231
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,520
that's why it's so strong and you sort

232
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,160
of see

233
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
that it really comes down to your

234
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,720
shearing versus compressing

235
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,879
and that's that's something which we're

236
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,560
going to look at now

237
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,680
so over here let's say

238
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,680
i have just you know

239
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,839
an unsuspecting square

240
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,200
so now with a square um

241
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,519
let's say it's sort of made out of

242
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,680
aluminum

243
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,519
and i'm just going to pull on it here

244
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,399
so now if i'm going to pull on it uh

245
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,600
what happens

246
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,240
well what happens is that the square

247
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
will the entire square will just move

248
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,680
to the right or i guess for you guys

249
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,399
um so that's uh that's sort of

250
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,080
what would happen if i just applied one

251
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,519
force so that's why

252
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,519
you sort of always see two forces being

253
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,600
applied unfortunately everything is

254
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,839
inverted 90 degrees

255
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,240
i think if i do this

256
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,360
there we go it's gonna be a bit hard for

257
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,839
me

258
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,399
but let's see i can probably work with

259
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,120
this

260
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,240
okay yeah so over here uh let's say you

261
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,959
know

262
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,200
let's just randomly have the force be

263
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
like let's say five newtons here

264
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,560
and five newtons here so now what

265
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,120
happens

266
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,680
is that you have two forces here it's in

267
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,519
translation equilibrium this is you know

268
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,720
your high school

269
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,839
uh physics that you've done now what

270
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,839
you'll actually see happening

271
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,240
is

272
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,040
here so you will actually sort of see

273
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,079
the whole shape deforms

274
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,640
slightly

275
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,600
and over here

276
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
we are going to describe this

277
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,399
deformation

278
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,600
so you'll sort of see that the shape

279
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,040
actually deforms and

280
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,160
you know we're going to talk about how

281
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,399
we can really use that definition

282
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,880
uh now i'm sure unfortunately i actually

283
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,480
don't have a rubber band right here

284
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,839
but i'm sure if you guys have ever

285
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
pulled a rubber band you can sort of see

286
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
that it deforms so much

287
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,000
uh just yeah so just for the

288
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
just from pulling on it so now we're

289
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,880
actually going to see how definition

290
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,680
works

291
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,800
so what happens is that you want to look

292
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,920
at deformations in terms of stresses so

293
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,000
let's say if i'm putting a force here

294
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,360
i actually don't want to think of this

295
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
in terms of a force that makes things

296
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,240
complicated

297
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,040
so you want to um like the whole concept

298
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,760
of mechanics

299
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,240
is actually non-dimensionalizing so what

300
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,079
that means is that let's say if i have a

301
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,519
force over here

302
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,640
of let's say x newtons

303
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,480
and it is pulling on

304
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,920
a surface with a cross sectional

305
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,200
area of let's say

306
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,800
y meter squared then you would actually

307
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
think about it in terms of the stress

308
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,680
now the stress which i would use sigma

309
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,040
sigma i'm just writing stress

310
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,320
is equal to your force upon area

311
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,680
so force upon area which in this case

312
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,120
is equal to x upon y now one question

313
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,160
that i get asked a lot

314
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,920
is you know what is the difference

315
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
between stress

316
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,959
and pressure because isn't pressure

317
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,560
force upon area and

318
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,680
yeah so pressure is forced upon area but

319
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,120
the main difference is sort of how we

320
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,600
use it

321
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,760
so with stress you'll sort of see later

322
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
you have different examples of how

323
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,440
stress is acting on a body where

324
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,720
pressure cannot

325
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,120
and another thing you really look at is

326
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,320
stress is sort of talking about what

327
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,079
happens internally with the body

328
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,760
so you're not actually looking at the

329
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,360
force you're applying to the body

330
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,600
you're actually looking at the internal

331
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,360
force which the body is pulling back

332
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,920
with

333
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,519
and that force will always be the same

334
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,360
so it's just easier to think about it

335
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,800
in terms of the forces you're putting on

336
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,959
the body so

337
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,279
here you actually have a definition for

338
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,639
stress

339
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,440
so that's quite simple now how do you do

340
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,000
string

341
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,680
so strain which you would write

342
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,240
epsilon is your strain

343
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,880
so with strain let's take a look at this

344
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,839
thing again

345
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,079
so let's say this is x

346
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,079
and let's say this thing over here is

347
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,519
delta x by 2

348
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,040
so the total so the old length over here

349
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:21,040
is equal to x and the new length

350
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,399
plus delta x right and i promise we'll

351
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,000
be done with the boring match

352
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,600
uh so over here you have you have a

353
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,519
description for the old length and the

354
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,639
new length

355
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,440
and your strain is actually equal to

356
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,959
delta x over x so you're actually

357
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,959
looking for the change in length

358
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,240
so you're looking for the difference

359
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,360
between the old length and the new

360
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,120
length and you're dividing it by the old

361
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,760
level

362
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,720
so that is how you get the strain now

363
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,839
this is useful

364
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,360
but with a simulation you only know the

365
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,160
forces

366
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,920
you don't you don't know the effect of

367
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,519
the forces i mean if you knew the effect

368
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,199
why would you be doing the simulation

369
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,040
that's just waste of time so there's

370
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
actually a relationship between

371
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,199
stress and strain and that's hooke's law

372
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,600
and that is that

373
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,920
your stress is equal to young's modulus

374
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,560
industry um and so let me just

375
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,839
nicely label this

376
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,000
so now you guys are familiar with what

377
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,040
stress is

378
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,519
and what strain is but you're not really

379
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,199
sure about what young's modulus is

380
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,240
that's a new one

381
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,199
so young's modulus actually is sort of

382
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,600
an inherent property of the material

383
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,639
um and young's modulus is basically

384
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,480
uh determines the elasticity of the

385
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,639
material so

386
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,920
let's say something with a very high

387
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,839
young's modulus means that i would need

388
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,160
to

389
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,800
you know pull it a lot to see any kind

390
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,079
of deformation

391
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,519
whereas something with a low young's

392
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,480
modulus uh means that you would

393
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,240
you really wouldn't have to pull much to

394
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
see that definition

395
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,880
so for instance like i can give some

396
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,240
values

397
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,800
with aluminum the typical

398
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,839
typical young's modulus value is 68

399
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,079
gigapascals um let's see

400
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,279
with steel it ends up being um

401
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,360
ends up being around 130 gigapascals

402
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,800
so you can see these are some really

403
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,040
large values and if you actually look at

404
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,680
this

405
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,600
with stress uh with the relationship

406
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,120
between stress young's modulus

407
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,600
and strain you see that unless the force

408
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,720
you're applying is

409
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,000
really really huge your uh your strain

410
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,759
is actually going to be very low and

411
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,079
that's true the typical strain values

412
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,040
you'll end up having are something like

413
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,360
so

414
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:23,839
here's actually

415
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,279
watch that and your typical strain

416
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
values

417
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,040
end up coming to you know approximately

418
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,720
like let's say 0.001 also

419
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,640
so you actually deal with like really

420
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,079
low orders of magnitude

421
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,839
and that's why you know like let's say

422
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,319
if if i just you know like pull on my

423
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,359
steel bottle

424
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,720
you're not you're not going to see

425
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,119
anything because uh well unfortunately

426
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,280
i'm not that strong

427
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,480
but yeah so that's sort of um

428
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,119
where you'll see deformations happening

429
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,119
now deformations are good and all

430
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,440
but you want to sort of see what what

431
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,679
does the deformation mean

432
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,600
so over here i am actually gonna

433
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,719
sort of plot a curve

434
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,640
this curve is known as

435
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,600
cluster stream

436
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,080
and your typical curve looks

437
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,840
something like this

438
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,360
over here so you have a couple of key

439
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,400
points you have

440
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,679
this point over here you will have this

441
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,120
point

442
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,000
over here and then

443
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,400
you have this point over here

444
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,080
so does anyone have any guesses about

445
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,760
what each of these points means

446
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,280
just any guess you guys can yeah one one

447
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,240
guess is that

448
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
left most point is a point of the von

449
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,919
mises stress where you are

450
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,120
the end of the elastic region that's

451
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,520
right

452
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,879
so this is your limit

453
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,120
and i guess that's also the limit for

454
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,840
where the hook's law is

455
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,880
appropriate right yes that is that is

456
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
exactly true

457
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,880
so over here if you sort of see your

458
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,600
gradient

459
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,639
so you would have

460
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,280
your gradient is equal to

461
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,360
and that is only true for this region

462
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,440
because as you can see over here you no

463
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
longer have that constant gradient

464
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,679
so in fact if you sort of want to

465
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,360
be a bit more technical you can actually

466
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,960
look at later points where

467
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,799
in fact over here you actually have a

468
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,559
variable young's modulus

469
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,240
but that's sort of something that you

470
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,720
don't really have to worry about

471
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,360
but yeah that is something interesting

472
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,720
now i think

473
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,480
i think some of you guys can probably

474
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,240
guess what this next point is

475
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,880
probably breaks yep so that is your

476
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,039
fracture point

477
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,160
and the one in the middle is a absolute

478
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,280
stress limit

479
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,200
so yeah so this is sort of the highest

480
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
stress it can take

481
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,159
but there's a very interesting name for

482
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,440
what happens here it's called

483
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,840
necking

484
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,000
so what's interesting about necking is

485
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,960
that

486
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,440
now this is called a stress strain curve

487
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
but what it actually sort of measures

488
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,640
is let's say you have you have machines

489
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
which can sort of put a lot of tensile

490
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,480
stress so you would essentially the

491
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,320
machine would actually be measuring the

492
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,120
force

493
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,000
and you just divide it by the area to

494
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,120
get the stress

495
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,760
so what actually happens is at your

496
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,480
necking point

497
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,960
because logically this really doesn't

498
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,480
make sense how

499
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,440
um uh how could it be that let's say

500
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,919
if if i sort of keep my stress at a

501
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,200
constant value

502
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,880
it'll suddenly start breaking that

503
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
doesn't work it it shouldn't just

504
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,960
elongate even more if i just leave my

505
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,159
force constant

506
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,480
and that's the thing that is in a

507
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,080
perfect world that would actually never

508
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,799
happen

509
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,919
but what happens is that uh we live in

510
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,120
an imperfect world

511
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,640
and that is why this always happens

512
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,000
with anything so

513
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,640
it's that i'm pulling on this

514
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,360
right so this is the beam which i'm

515
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,320
pulling on

516
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
and at the necking point what happens is

517
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,559
that sort of chunks of material

518
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,760
come away over here

519
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,919
and this is of course going to be where

520
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,919
my fracture is and if you can see

521
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,120
this length this length

522
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,200
let's see let me make this x and let me

523
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,280
make this y

524
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,320
so x is clearly less than y

525
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,480
and what that means is that the area

526
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,720
the area at x

527
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,280
is less than the area

528
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,320
at y and since we know that your stress

529
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,440
is actually the force upon area

530
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,559
what happens is that if you're

531
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,720
decreasing the area you're increasing

532
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,840
the stress

533
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,080
so that means that you actually have a

534
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,280
higher stress

535
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,840
even though the force remains constant

536
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,799
and that's why

537
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,720
you get this point where even though

538
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,400
your force is staying constant

539
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,640
your stress is actually increasing and

540
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,080
that's why you get to hear where you

541
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,679
need to actually decrease the force if

542
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,080
you want to prevent it from fracturing

543
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,000
so you know this the limit of elasticity

544
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,039
is like the

545
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,720
this is like the point you probably

546
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,360
shouldn't cross

547
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,280
yeah if you don't want permanent uh um

548
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,960
what do you call it change yeah

549
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,360
this is the point you definitely

550
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:09,840
shouldn't cross

551
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,000
and this is your start over region

552
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,120
yeah that's sort of a fun way of

553
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,039
remembering but yeah that's

554
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,120
that's very important you don't want to

555
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,480
have uh

556
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,760
you don't want to deal with any

557
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,840
permanent definitions so what actually

558
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
happens is i'm not going to draw it here

559
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,880
because it gets too crowded

560
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
but actually you know at any point if

561
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,240
you stop loading

562
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,760
it'll actually sort of come back

563
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,320
in a straight line with the gradient of

564
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,440
the young's modulus

565
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
so that means that obviously if it's

566
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,200
within your elastic region

567
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
you'll just come back to zero and you

568
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,960
would have an undeformed body

569
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,279
but let's say if it's sort of out here

570
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,880
it'll be coming back here so you can

571
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,559
still see there would be a slight

572
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,600
there would be a slight permanent

573
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,000
deformation and that means that like you

574
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
know let's say if you keep on loading

575
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,240
and unloading

576
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,159
that is something which you don't want

577
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,480
although you know in certain edge cases

578
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,320
if there is something which you like

579
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,799
only plan to use like once or twice then

580
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,320
it might be okay

581
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,559
to do that but please don't call me up

582
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,960
if it breaks

583
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,760
i don't really uh sort of vouch for that

584
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,240
so

585
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,520
these are your normal forces but

586
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,679
i think as you guys saw with that

587
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,120
demonstration

588
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,799
normal forces really aren't the things

589
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,559
you need to be worried about because

590
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,919
over here

591
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,000
i i just i couldn't break this by

592
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
pulling it i couldn't break this by sort

593
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,880
of compressing it

594
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,480
i could only break it when i just

595
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,000
snapped it

596
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,840
and snapping is what is your shear force

597
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,360
now shear force is a bit more annoying

598
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,559
to show

599
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,240
so let's say if i have something over

600
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,559
here

601
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,559
like this

602
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,600
okay so shear force essentially means

603
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,200
it's acting parallel

604
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,799
so let's say you know i might be

605
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,440
sort of sort of pushing this up from

606
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,320
here

607
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,760
now as you guys remember from the

608
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,520
previous diagram if i sort of push it up

609
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,159
from here

610
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,080
the whole thing will just go up all

611
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,679
right there so since it needs to be

612
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,799
parallel

613
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,640
i guess i'll sort of push it down from

614
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,840
here as well

615
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,400
all right that's cool um but no that's

616
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,200
not enough

617
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,559
now it's going to rotate so that means i

618
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,919
actually need to sort of push it here

619
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,559
and push it there as well and that's

620
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,000
sort of where it gets

621
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,400
when it gets a bit complicated and you

622
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,600
know this

623
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,760
it seems very complex but this is the

624
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,120
kind of thing which you just

625
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,799
which you uh which you don't even think

626
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,520
about like let's say if you have

627
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,440
if you have like a sheet of paper or in

628
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,200
my case if you have

629
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,080
this sort of stirrer now i'm not i'm not

630
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,679
just pushing this up and pulling this

631
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,240
down

632
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,080
what i'm doing is i'm using my thumb as

633
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,640
a pivot so

634
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,960
i'm actually sort of creating that force

635
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,720
where i'm keeping this in translational

636
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,240
equilibrium here

637
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
and then i'm pushing up from here which

638
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,760
causes it to break

639
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,600
so you know now we're sort of breaking

640
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,760
that down in terms of forces

641
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,679
so again over here all of these forces

642
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,679
are constant

643
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,640
and let's say if this is your xy plane

644
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,840
this your is force is a tau

645
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,720
so this would be tau

646
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,240
x this would be also bigger

647
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,000
this is probably not ideal in a 2d

648
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,360
example because

649
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,080
you would actually see these forces in a

650
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,360
3d example

651
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,000
where you would have sort of like x y y

652
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,679
x and all

653
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,720
so this is

654
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,760
so let's let's give another let's give

655
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,320
some more

656
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,039
examples of sharing because honestly

657
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:21,440
like

658
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,240
for me sharing was just this very weird

659
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,960
thing

660
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,760
which i could like it honestly took me a

661
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,360
long time to get my head around

662
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,440
uh because it's just it's so weird to

663
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,799
think about you don't really think about

664
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,080
things that way

665
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,120
so i found that the best example

666
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,279
is actually a book so

667
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,600
right here i have a math textbook

668
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
because why not

669
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,799
so if i try to sort of compress this

670
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,840
textbook

671
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,760
or pull it again you can see not much

672
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,039
happens

673
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,039
but now let me see if i try to sort of

674
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:57,760
share it

675
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,080
so i'm sorry pushing it along from the

676
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,200
top only

677
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
you can sort of see the pages here slide

678
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,120
over it's

679
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,240
a bit it's not very visible but you can

680
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,960
sort of see

681
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,440
over here that that these pages are

682
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,600
sliding over it's coming at some kind of

683
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
angle

684
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,720
so now i can actually describe that

685
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,279
so if i look at my deformed body let's

686
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,760
not make it on the same diagram

687
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:31,840
so this is my deformed body

688
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,200
so all right

689
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,840
and now over here is your lamp

690
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
so

691
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,919
so this was your original length of the

692
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,520
body

693
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,960
and this is your definition so let's

694
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,000
call this delta

695
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,960
x so now we need to figure out how we're

696
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,640
going to measure the shear force so

697
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,679
all right so let's say your shear force

698
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,240
tau is equal to delta x

699
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,520
all right seems reasonable but wait okay

700
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,720
let's see if i measure it from here

701
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,440
now delta x is a lot smaller but the

702
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,720
force is still the same

703
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,120
if i had an object that was uh sort of

704
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,240
half the height

705
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,520
that means my uh my strain is somehow

706
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,559
less

707
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,399
my stress is somehow less but we

708
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,840
remember that stresses

709
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,559
actually don't um are sort of constant

710
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,480
no matter what the dimensions are

711
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,399
so that means it can't be this

712
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
now what we can actually realize the one

713
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,320
thing that's constant here is actually

714
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,960
this angle

715
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,799
so the angle can actually be taken

716
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,880
as so you actually take it as delta x

717
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,240
over l is equal to the string

718
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,399
and if i call this angle theta uh this

719
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,919
is also equal to

720
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,120
tan theta if you guys remember sohcahtoa

721
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,320
this is your opposite upon adjacent

722
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,640
um so this is how you describe your

723
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,679
strain

724
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,720
and the symbol for that

725
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,880
is gamma so gamma is your strength

726
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,039
which just specify shear

727
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,000
and again the same relationships apply

728
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,399
so

729
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,279
you know that this is sort of delta

730
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,960
delta x over l

731
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,320
you know uh that this sort of

732
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,000
tau which is is equal to

733
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,440
your force upon area that remains

734
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,960
constant

735
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,480
it's just that the force is being loaded

736
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,080
in a separate direction the area still

737
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,679
stays the same

738
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,399
this would be the three so this is your

739
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,840
force upon area

740
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,639
which is equal

741
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,279
stress

742
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,559
all right so now on to the relationship

743
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,519
between them

744
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,279
so tau is equal to

745
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,200
young's modulus no way that doesn't look

746
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,000
right

747
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,559
so the thing is that you know with your

748
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,960
with your compressive and tensile forces

749
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,640
you sort of saw that they were more or

750
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,919
less the same so you could actually

751
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:22,960
describe them

752
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,039
with young's modulus in this case you

753
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,000
can't use young

754
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,480
yum's modulus that's wrong you have to

755
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,760
use this

756
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,120
which is the shear modulus so g

757
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,039
is your shear

758
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,399
modulus and let's just rewrite this so

759
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,760
doubt which is

760
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
stress

761
00:31:48,640 --> 00:32:01,840
is equal to

762
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,080
so this is sort of your relationship and

763
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,279
one thing that's very neat

764
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,080
is that you can you can actually there

765
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,720
is

766
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,480
uh obviously this isn't something that

767
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,399
applies to absolutely everything

768
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,200
but generally like as a rule of thumb

769
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,000
you can say

770
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,760
that your shear modulus

771
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,120
is approximately equal to your young's

772
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,519
modulus divided by three

773
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,279
and this is why shear forces are

774
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,720
actually the ones you need to be afraid

775
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,519
of

776
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,559
because shear forces if you can see as

777
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,519
g as g becomes smaller that means your

778
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,200
strain actually increases while the

779
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,960
stress remains constant

780
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,640
so you actually want a modulus that's

781
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
large and that's why shear forces are

782
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,480
the ones that you need to be afraid of

783
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,279
if i have uh if i just sort of take a

784
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,799
sheet of paper

785
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,760
you know by pulling on it it's i mean i

786
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,360
could break it but like

787
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,279
it's unlikely and obviously not by

788
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,840
pushing on it but if i tear it

789
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,480
it's very easy and that's where your

790
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,159
shear forces come into play

791
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,440
you really want to avoid forces and now

792
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,240
we can actually go back to this example

793
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,880
over here

794
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,080
so the thing is that now what i'm

795
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,840
actually doing here is i'm applying a

796
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,519
load parallel to this face

797
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,240
which allows it to get sheer now the

798
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,919
thing is that over here

799
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,919
if i'm applying a load parallel to this

800
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,440
face that

801
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,279
uh that sort of just ends up being

802
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,559
normal to

803
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,640
in other sense so you actually just

804
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,919
can't apply it

805
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,760
you really can't sort of effectively

806
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,039
apply shear forces here

807
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,039
you know like i'm really trying the only

808
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,960
time this sort of bends is actually when

809
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,600
the

810
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,320
when the rod itself bends and that shows

811
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,279
how strong

812
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,600
triangles really are and honestly this

813
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,640
is something which i would highly

814
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,760
recommend making

815
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,440
it's just like you know any kind of

816
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,120
story you can find at home

817
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,679
uh really anything you can make this and

818
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,440
it just allows you to sew

819
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,159
so like you know visually see the

820
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,879
difference

821
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,480
between the forces and now i think sort

822
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,440
of the final

823
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,320
and probably the most cliche example

824
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,679
that you have

825
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,960
of these forces and

826
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,239
let me just do that

827
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,599
so here

828
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,839
so like let's see if i have the sheet

829
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,199
now with scissors

830
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,520
if you sort of see these faces aren't

831
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,320
actually aligned

832
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,839
so if i start to do a diagram of

833
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,159
scissors it's not like this

834
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,159
it's actually like this where they sort

835
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,960
of offset from each other

836
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,199
and that is why they're actually able to

837
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,320
shear it

838
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,719
because if you see they're making the

839
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,639
area very very small and that's what

840
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,520
allows scissors so effectively to cut

841
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,599
but one thing to note is that scissors

842
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,280
are actually just applying this

843
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,599
upward and downward force the thing is

844
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,040
that they're just taking advantage of

845
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
leverage so that they're actually able

846
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,760
to cut

847
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,240
because you are assuming that uh that

848
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,400
the material will reach a breaking point

849
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,880
before it actually turns now that isn't

850
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,320
always the case so over here i have

851
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,000
these slightly blunt scissors and i've

852
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,720
sort of

853
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,480
tried to manipulate this as much as i

854
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,160
can and so

855
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,000
if i do it just right hopefully it

856
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,160
doesn't cut

857
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,240
and if you see like this you sort of get

858
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,680
this kind of situation where it gets

859
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
stuck in between the scissors

860
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,880
and that's because this whole thing has

861
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,040
just rotated and i've sort of gotten

862
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,000
stuck in here

863
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,359
and that's why scissors don't always

864
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,040
work

865
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,119
so that's sort of something which you

866
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,400
know i'm sure you guys

867
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,839
would have had situations where with

868
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,400
scissors you've

869
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,240
uh like it's just not been able to cut

870
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,920
it okay and that's exactly why

871
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,480
all right so now we get to some of the

872
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,599
fun stuff

873
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,640
now sort of very quickly

874
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,920
revisiting this you can sort of see over

875
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,320
here

876
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,560
when i showed here not only is this

877
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,400
stretching this is actually shrinking

878
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,000
side

879
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,839
and it's shrinking because of this thing

880
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,839
called poisson's ratio

881
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,599
ratio so

882
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,880
poisson's ratio actually describes the

883
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,320
relationship between

884
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,440
the contraction on the other axis

885
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,400
and sort of the extension so what's a

886
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,480
bit annoying is that the symbol for it

887
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,320
is sort of this it's not velocity it's

888
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,640
i mean people are bad at sort of giving

889
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,040
symbols to things now what's really easy

890
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,200
is that if i sort of look at strain

891
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,920
so like let's say a strain of strain in

892
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
the x direction

893
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,119
i can actually sort of say that is equal

894
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,079
to

895
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,119
negative poisson's ratio times the

896
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,880
string in the y direction

897
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,280
so this actually allows us to sort of go

898
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,800
to three dimensional cases

899
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,640
because now you know that this force

900
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,920
here gives you a certain strain in the x

901
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,440
in the x direction

902
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,200
and you can use your poisson's ratio to

903
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,640
find the strain in the y direction

904
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,200
so in this case because you know uh you

905
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,400
want to know why

906
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,480
it would sort of be like this instead

907
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,920
but you're taking the known one and

908
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,760
you're using this to find the unknown

909
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,680
and if you actually wanted to find the

910
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,119
strain in z

911
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,880
in this case which is the one you can't

912
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,599
see on the paper

913
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,720
which is also equal to this um

914
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,960
this is assuming that the material is

915
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,480
isotropic

916
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,200
um isotropic is just a fancy word for

917
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,359
saying it's the same in all directions

918
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,040
which is like if you guys are familiar

919
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,960
with the grain with like you know wood

920
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,880
being a green material you know that

921
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,960
it's stronger if you put forces on it

922
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,240
like let's say if you're working along

923
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,880
the grain

924
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,400
wood is much weaker whereas if you're

925
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,920
working against the grain

926
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,440
um it's a lot uh it's a lot stronger

927
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,800
so that's that's sort of where

928
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,720
anisotropic comes along but

929
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,079
you sort of don't really need to worry

930
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,000
about that for the understanding

931
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,760
um but yeah so if you're using

932
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,280
anisotropic materials

933
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,880
you'll have to sort of specify that in

934
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,440
your analysis

935
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,280
so over here this actually tells us

936
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,560
poisson's ratio

937
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,400
and the reason it's negative is because

938
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,480
if you see over here an extension

939
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
leads to a contraction so that's why

940
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,160
this just allows poisson's ratio to be

941
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,599
positive number

942
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,680
now i hope at least some of you are

943
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,640
wondering

944
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,320
well what if poisson's ratio is a

945
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,720
negative number is that even possible

946
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,760
and to that i show you this so

947
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,839
this is called the herringbone

948
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,040
destination

949
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,200
and if you see if i actually like as i

950
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,560
pull this along

951
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,640
it sort of expands outwards so this

952
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,119
actually has a negative poisson ratio

953
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,960
so it's a bit cheaty i mean i'm using

954
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,359
origami here but origami actually has

955
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,200
very interesting applications in

956
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,960
engineering that's something i'll come

957
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,359
to

958
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,800
so this is sort of like you know one of

959
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,640
those really cool ways

960
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,480
to sort of show some like you know

961
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,079
exceptions to the rule

962
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,920
where this would actually have a

963
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,440
negative person's ratio

964
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,040
and this is something which you can just

965
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,320
this is just a sheet of paper that's

966
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,200
been folded

967
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,720
you can check out youtube tutorials on

968
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,240
this although i would not recommend it

969
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,079
it is a pain to make

970
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,440
um we had we had a blackout

971
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,240
in my city like uh just all the power

972
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,240
went out so i was bored and i just made

973
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,720
this

974
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,320
so i thought why not and now

975
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,000
you guys may be thinking like you know

976
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,640
what what is the real world use of this

977
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,800
herringbone destination

978
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,160
and this sort of isn't one but to that

979
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,040
i give you this so this doesn't look

980
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,079
that impressive right now

981
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,720
just a sort of folded sheet of paper but

982
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,040
this is actually called the miura 4

983
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,160
and this is sort of another example of

984
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,680
mechanic poisson's ratio

985
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,599
but it has some really cool applications

986
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,240
so if i just pull on my fingers here

987
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,480
you can see the whole thing expands out

988
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,760
into a sheet of paper

989
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,359
what's really cool is that i can sort of

990
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,119
just compress it down back

991
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,280
really easily so what this allows me to

992
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,880
do is just with

993
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,680
i'm literally just putting um like i

994
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,200
could just sort of have this be still

995
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,880
i'm just putting one force

996
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,800
and the whole thing is coming up and

997
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,280
this is actually what is used by nasa

998
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,119
in space applications for deployable

999
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,800
solar panels you'd actually have solar

1000
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,400
panels on each of these things

1001
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,440
you'd have the entire thing folded up

1002
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,040
and it would just be it would be center

1003
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,960
space like this you'd have a single

1004
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,680
motor

1005
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,760
that just pulls it out and then suddenly

1006
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,440
you have a gigantic array of solar

1007
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,800
panels that's bigger than the shuttle

1008
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,599
itself it's

1009
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,760
really cool and i would highly recommend

1010
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,520
making this it's quite simple takes

1011
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,119
about 20 minutes

1012
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,359
and it's just i mean it's it's really

1013
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,640
fun to play around with

1014
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,240
it is it never gets old uh

1015
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,280
so that's that's called uh the miura

1016
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,480
fold and it has

1017
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,240
it has really interesting applications

1018
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,760
so that's sort of just showing

1019
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,599
where you're looking for where you're

1020
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,280
looking for like sort of exceptions of

1021
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,440
the rule for interesting occurrences

1022
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,960
you can get these sort of crazy

1023
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,720
applications

1024
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,000
so that's that's sort of like you know

1025
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,440
something that i thought was really

1026
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,359
interesting

1027
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,760
so yeah i think that's that's sort of

1028
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,920
like the basics that

1029
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,440
i've got for you know your different

1030
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,480
uh forces and all and this should give

1031
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,800
you that understanding of like you know

1032
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,560
like let's say if i were to sort of try

1033
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,920
and compress

1034
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,200
a block uh like a metal piece

1035
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,280
how would i how would i calculate that

1036
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,640
and then obviously this

1037
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,480
in later you know once you get to more

1038
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,400
complex examples it could be

1039
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,760
you could bring it to let's say if i

1040
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,440
have a building and if i have

1041
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,040
wind force acting on the very top of

1042
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,520
that building how much is that going to

1043
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,640
how much is that going to shake

1044
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,920
so yeah i think right now i sort of uh

1045
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,160
want to sort of take a slight pause and

1046
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,240
just check if anyone has

1047
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,400
any questions um you know anything else

1048
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
or otherwise then i can actually sort of

1049
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,839
move on to how

1050
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,319
you'll uh you'll be bringing this into a

1051
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:07,760
simulation software

1052
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,880
and i'm actually using that

1053
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,280
[Music]

1054
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,040
just what was the name of that fold

1055
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,960
again i tried to google it just now and

1056
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,599
came up

1057
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,560
yeah i uh wait let me actually just

1058
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,319
double check to make sure my spelling is

1059
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,599
correct

1060
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,000
um

1061
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,280
all right yeah so it is mirror

1062
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,520
and the other one is okay cool thanks

1063
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,000
beauty yeah the other one is having more

1064
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,359
desolation

1065
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,759
although it's like a lot of effort

1066
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,720
i actually had a friend who who tried

1067
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,040
doing the herringbone tessellation

1068
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,760
and uh yeah i think she attempted it

1069
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,280
like three times and then just gave up

1070
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,960
you need to make a mistake that can do

1071
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,640
that

1072
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,040
i honestly i would not be surprised if

1073
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,839
there were

1074
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,800
machines like that it's yeah but the the

1075
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,560
herringbone desolation it just

1076
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,319
it looks it looks a lot more

1077
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,400
intimidating it looks a lot more fun

1078
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,599
than the other one 3d printing 3d

1079
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,800
printing would be interesting

1080
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,240
although i'm not sure if you can get

1081
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,000
that level of flexibility

1082
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,960
with regulated materials the one

1083
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,760
interesting

1084
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,720
other thing other which i would like to

1085
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,879
show

1086
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,160
is this

1087
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,599
this is the impossible table so if you

1088
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,960
can see over here

1089
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,760
now i would i would like to see if

1090
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,319
someone

1091
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,960
wants to take a shot at explaining this

1092
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,520
these

1093
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,920
are just pieces of string there's no

1094
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,560
sort of like editing magic going on here

1095
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,240
would anyone sort of like understand how

1096
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,960
how on earth is this staying up

1097
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,440
and then i'll show you guys my terrible

1098
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,480
recreation of it

1099
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,119
yeah i think for the people who came in

1100
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,960
late you might want to show them

1101
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,720
that uh thing with the string too but

1102
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,040
so i think yeah it's the secret to this

1103
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,160
small little string

1104
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,359
in the middle right that like pulls

1105
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,720
the top one up yeah

1106
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,200
yeah that's that's exactly it so yeah so

1107
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,079
do you want to sort of

1108
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,839
elaborate on that no

1109
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,160
i mean

1110
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,960
go just go for it i mean honestly like

1111
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,040
guesses are yes they're great you get a

1112
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,920
lot of stuff from this

1113
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,160
so yeah i guess the middle string pulls

1114
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,800
it up the

1115
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,800
three corners pulls it down and they

1116
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,079
kind of balance yeah

1117
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,480
yeah yeah so that's where the fight goes

1118
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,680
so let me

1119
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,560
uh let me try to see if i can draw a

1120
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,240
diagram for this

1121
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,040
so let's say over here now i'm just

1122
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,359
going to sort of show a 2d version

1123
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,680
like this and the 3d version is a

1124
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,960
triangle so you just have to deal with

1125
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,480
one extra piece of string

1126
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,839
now in in a perfect word

1127
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,920
this one piece of string is enough

1128
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,359
because this one piece of string is just

1129
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,960
sort of holding it apart

1130
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,200
so this prevents it from going down but

1131
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,880
again moments exist

1132
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,440
so this can sort of tip over this way so

1133
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,280
now to prevent it from tipping over this

1134
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,000
way

1135
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,240
what i can do is i can add a piece of

1136
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,760
string here

1137
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,599
so now this piece of string is stored it

1138
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,200
prevents it from tipping over this way

1139
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,280
but now i can tip over that way so i

1140
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,880
just add another piece of string here

1141
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,440
and

1142
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,839
this just add another piece of string

1143
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,599
here and that prevents it from tipping

1144
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:42,319
over that way

1145
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,480
now obviously because it's a 3d example

1146
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,880
it can also tip over that way

1147
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,319
and that's why i sort of added string

1148
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,560
here but um

1149
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,400
i'm not that good at drawing so you guys

1150
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,800
are just going to have to imagine it

1151
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,119
and this one is like making this is

1152
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,720
actually a lot harder than it looks

1153
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,640
to be fair i don't have a 3d printer so

1154
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,040
i had to make it out of acrylic

1155
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,599
and yeah it turned out sort of about as

1156
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,079
well as you can expect oh go back to

1157
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,720
your camera i want to see it up close

1158
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,000
uh wait i think can you see it now

1159
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,200
like this how do we how do we make this

1160
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,240
view big instead of the other one

1161
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,839
can you push something uh it's in the

1162
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:30,400
top right

1163
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,440
corner yeah there's a view button that

1164
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,400
you can click in the top

1165
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,720
right corner yeah cool all right does it

1166
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,839
look

1167
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,280
yeah so now it should be yeah so this

1168
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,440
this is basically the uh yeah so

1169
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,440
the thing is that i sort of cheated with

1170
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,440
this quite a bit

1171
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,280
so like there's actually sort of like

1172
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,640
touching going on

1173
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,560
and that's that's sort of what's keeping

1174
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,800
it together i think i got like a few

1175
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,720
edge cases where without touching it was

1176
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,839
able to

1177
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,240
more or less stand still i think it

1178
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,240
might not be touching anything right now

1179
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,160
okay it's not touching anything right

1180
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,839
now and it's just about staying

1181
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,760
but the thing is that with this because

1182
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,599
you know you need to do it very well

1183
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,160
because this happens if you put enough

1184
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,800
force

1185
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,720
the whole thing just steps because you

1186
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,920
have like different points of

1187
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,040
equilibrium

1188
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,880
and it just needs to sort of like it

1189
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,400
needs to be very well done and that's

1190
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,160
why i recommend if you're doing this

1191
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,880
uh 3d print it um but yeah that's sort

1192
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,160
of

1193
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,640
that's sort of my terrible recreation of

1194
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,520
it

1195
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,760
yeah but i guess the smallest

1196
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,960
deformation will

1197
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,480
kind of allow it to move right

1198
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,119
yeah exactly so it's sort of like yeah

1199
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:41,920
you sort of

1200
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,599
need to you're just banking on that

1201
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,359
slight area where over here it becomes

1202
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,079
more taut

1203
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,160
but once it sort of escapes that

1204
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,079
threshold then you just have everything

1205
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,079
that's just nicely chilling slack

1206
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,599
like this so yeah it's it's it's a bit

1207
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:56,880
of a pain but it was a fun

1208
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,880
thing to work on although i probably

1209
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,720
shouldn't have been using my hacksaw so

1210
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,400
late at night

1211
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,920
it's actually kind of hard to see the

1212
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,319
way it fails i like that

1213
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,160
yeah so it's it's sort of interesting to

1214
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,520
see like the

1215
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,960
to try and make these things for

1216
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,280
yourself because you can sort of see

1217
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,800
uh from the back end of these and

1218
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,200
so now let me just

1219
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,119
actually just maybe instead of using

1220
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,200
just one stick

1221
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,960
to the center you could make it out of

1222
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,559
triangles like a

1223
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,079
pyramid form then it would be more stiff

1224
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,359
yeah that would yeah that would

1225
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,359
definitely be more stiff

1226
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,319
but yeah it sort of uh yeah so i sort of

1227
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,000
just wanted to make it more like that

1228
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,480
just

1229
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,160
have that like magic but yeah that would

1230
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,920
definitely be a lot more stupid

1231
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,920
so it's actually interesting you have

1232
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,800
you have very precisely made versions of

1233
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,559
these so it's called the impossible

1234
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,079
table um

1235
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,079
and actually yeah i almost forgot you

1236
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,200
told me to

1237
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,640
show the other one as well

1238
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,960
which is the impossible string so

1239
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,760
like this so i've sort of made it like

1240
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,960
this now obviously

1241
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,559
it's nothing impressive if it's lying

1242
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,640
down so if you can sort of see

1243
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,720
the camera with me you can sort of see

1244
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,880
how the whole thing stands

1245
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,960
uh just from the bottom so it's also

1246
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,280
about having that constant tension

1247
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,160
so with with these kinds of things it's

1248
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,839
really about you know

1249
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,520
it's quite impressive when you're able

1250
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,960
to work with objects that

1251
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,040
are very good in tension but not so much

1252
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,079
in compression

1253
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,599
and you can actually see examples of

1254
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,200
these like with bridges and all

1255
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,839
uh the strings that hold down bridges um

1256
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:38,319
those

1257
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,720
are a great example of that so it's sort

1258
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,240
of very cool where you can see all of

1259
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,040
these household

1260
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,200
examples and then you can relate that to

1261
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,839
what's actually happening

1262
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,680
so yeah i find that quite interesting

1263
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,760
so now i think um actually first does

1264
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,920
anyone have any questions about sort of

1265
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,440
all of the mechanics which we did this

1266
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,880
is basically like

1267
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,040
your sort of like first year college

1268
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,279
class

1269
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,520
all right great so now i shall

1270
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,319
be doing what it would be like to

1271
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,839
actually bring it into a software

1272
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,040
so now if

1273
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:27,839
i have this object over here

1274
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,640
let me actually attempt to make it 3d

1275
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,480
remember you have your whole

1276
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,599
tricks to do that

1277
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:55,839
let's see here

1278
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,839
oops i've drawn a lot of invisibility

1279
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,520
can just just pretend that doesn't exist

1280
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,880
and i need to present another one

1281
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,119
all right um

1282
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,480
yeah so this is sort of like

1283
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,200
a 3d representation of a cube so let's

1284
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:25,839
say if i

1285
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,280
actually like you know let's just do

1286
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,599
something as simple as just

1287
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,800
sort of having forces along here now

1288
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,640
let's say both of these forces

1289
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,839
are five

1290
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,839
five kilopascals that is a lot of force

1291
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,280
but sure why not

1292
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,240
you get some real tension out of this

1293
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,200
and

1294
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,079
you know what let's say this is aluminum

1295
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:50,960
this is

1296
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,480
aluminum cube and this is

1297
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,920
two meters by

1298
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,640
three meters and this volume

1299
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,200
so this one length is seven meters all

1300
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:13,599
right

1301
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,359
so all nice si units i mean gigapascals

1302
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,400
isn't the side but the

1303
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,839
young's modulus is in this side

1304
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,759
you know

1305
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,240
one that's the most common alloy that

1306
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,559
you end up working with

1307
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,079
uh wait now this is is it coming

1308
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,680
sideways for you guys or is it coming

1309
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:45,760
okay yeah all right perfect now this is

1310
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,280
now this is

1311
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,880
uh if you can work like that

1312
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,720
oh yeah no this is this is much easier

1313
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,160
earlier i had it like right in front of

1314
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,160
me i sort of had to like

1315
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,839
bring my arms around it now this is easy

1316
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,559
i just can you

1317
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,359
yeah so over here let's sort of you know

1318
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,119
quickly do

1319
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,440
uh like figure out what the what the

1320
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,559
strains would be

1321
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,319
so over here i have five gigapascals

1322
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,960
so let's let's first write down book

1323
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,520
store

1324
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:21,359
so you have this this times this

1325
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:28,800
and so you have five figure pascals

1326
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,680
over this is 23

1327
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,720
squared i guess that by drawing it like

1328
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,240
this way you have these

1329
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,520
uniform deformations all over the this

1330
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,119
shape you are kind of assuming that this

1331
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,359
force is not applied to the center point

1332
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,119
it's it's kind of distributed

1333
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,000
all over the surface right right yeah so

1334
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,640
that is

1335
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,160
that is sort of what they actually look

1336
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,540
like so you know

1337
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,520
[Music]

1338
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,960
then i get it yeah so so in fact if you

1339
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,800
sort of want force acting on a point

1340
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,240
that is where you'll sort of have to

1341
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,000
bring in simulations because that is too

1342
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,359
complicated to do

1343
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,319
yeah just on your own but you you can

1344
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,559
actually do that with simulations so

1345
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,720
uh yes but then i can kind of warp at

1346
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,319
the corners and stuff like that right

1347
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,280
yeah exactly

1348
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,960
that is that is what you'd see and then

1349
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,960
you'll be able to sort of see that with

1350
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,440
uh your whole heat map and everything so

1351
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,040
like you know let's say over here

1352
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,920
you have five gigapascals over this

1353
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,200
which is equal to

1354
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,200
strain which you're looking for into

1355
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,960
young's modulus which

1356
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,960
um i said young's modulus for aluminum

1357
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,160
is 68.

1358
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,359
gigapascals prefers for the 6061 alloy

1359
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,079
it's actually 69 gigapascal

1360
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,119
now i'm writing units here because

1361
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,880
usually you don't get such nice cases

1362
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,319
you would get cases in like

1363
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,640
forces in pascals you'd get like units

1364
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,079
and centimeters and all

1365
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,599
and you'd have to sort of deal with all

1366
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,680
of that conversions that's why if you're

1367
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,720
sort of ever doing

1368
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,960
like a work example like this because

1369
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,960
let's say if i want to see the forces on

1370
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,640
this it's a lot easier for me to just

1371
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,760
calculate it

1372
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,160
than to do simulation but once it gets

1373
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,920
more complex you'll see why simulation

1374
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,920
is so much easier

1375
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,720
so over here i can do that basic math so

1376
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,760
it becomes

1377
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,880
uh it becomes five by

1378
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,119
five

1379
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,920
[Music]

1380
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,640
all the units cancel out so it works out

1381
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,000
nicely for me

1382
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,720
and i'll get five

1383
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:37,040
six 69

1384
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,960
and i do not trust my mental math enough

1385
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,960
to do this so i will just

1386
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,400
sort of check on my calculator real

1387
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,839
quick

1388
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,880
and that comes to zero point

1389
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,880
one two approx uh yeah zero point

1390
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,520
zero one two approximately and that

1391
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,799
means that if i actually want the

1392
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,000
definition

1393
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,119
i would just multiply that by seven

1394
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,839
so the new length

1395
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,200
seven point zero eight

1396
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,960
five meters so you can see that like

1397
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,280
even though i had such a large force

1398
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,720
the the sort of the change in length

1399
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,640
uh wasn't this wasn't wasn't really much

1400
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,359
so yeah i think um you know would this

1401
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:43,680
be

1402
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,640
would this really be it for the example

1403
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,480
so it actually won't you sort of you

1404
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,720
still have to deal with the definition

1405
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,960
in the other directions and that's where

1406
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,920
your

1407
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,839
this thing comes in where

1408
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,480
ratio um so one thing one thing that's

1409
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,000
really handy to know

1410
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:13,839
is that for my from

1411
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,160
ratio is approximately equal to

1412
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,319
0.3 and for

1413
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,599
for

1414
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,040
0.5 so you can see 0.5 is quite a large

1415
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,079
number

1416
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,799
and that is where you you would actually

1417
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:39,680
see

1418
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,520
uh like let's say with your rubber band

1419
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,440
why it sort of changes so much

1420
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,440
what's really interesting though is that

1421
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,280
you have you have certain patterns

1422
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,520
unfortunately it's not origami it's sort

1423
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,359
of like a 3d printed pattern

1424
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,880
but you have patterns where you have

1425
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,960
like a poisson's ratio of zero

1426
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,880
i believe you even have one where it's a

1427
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,640
poisson's ratio of one although i'm not

1428
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,920
too sure about that

1429
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,599
so you get these very interesting edge

1430
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,119
cases and those are quite uh

1431
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,400
quite fun to work so over here let's say

1432
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,559
if i want to find epsilon y

1433
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,280
i would sort of just take epsilon x

1434
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,839
which is 0.012

1435
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:17,599
and multiply it by negative

1436
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,480
0.3 it's actually exactly 0.3 for

1437
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,200
aluminum

1438
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,799
so it will end up coming to an equal

1439
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,240
zero point

1440
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,319
zero zero

1441
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:31,920
six and that is where you'll sort of see

1442
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,119
so over here now and i can do the same

1443
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,480
thing with

1444
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,599
with epsilon z

1445
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,680
and that is also 0.0736

1446
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,359
so if uh if actually

1447
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:54,400
that into seven

1448
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,440
sorry into two and into three

1449
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,319
respectively

1450
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:04,160
let me first sort of here so upwards is

1451
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,480
y so that means

1452
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,359
delta y

1453
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:18,720
correct delta y is equal to

1454
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,520
two and now i'm not going to bother with

1455
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,880
writing all those lines

1456
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,040
but you can see how sort of this would

1457
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,160
shrink and this would expand over here

1458
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,160
and you'll be getting a brand uh you'll

1459
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,760
be getting a brand new cube

1460
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,000
with all of these different uh different

1461
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,359
dimensions

1462
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,920
so you can see like even for even for an

1463
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,079
example that was as simple as just me

1464
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,079
putting one force here

1465
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,000
uh you had to do sort of like all of

1466
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,079
this working just to get it

1467
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,480
now you know on the other hand you would

1468
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,240
sort of even see something where

1469
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,240
you'll have forces on all directions

1470
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,839
you'll have irregular shapes that's

1471
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,680
something which you just can't do

1472
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,440
so that's where that's where you would

1473
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,920
actually put it into the software

1474
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,680
and then the software would really sort

1475
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,319
of do all of the work for you

1476
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,640
so

1477
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,400
let's look at how the software does it

1478
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,559
so again i'm going to sort of take this

1479
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,520
simple example

1480
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,479
here

1481
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,440
now we are going to assume that this is

1482
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,760
some

1483
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,000
shape very complex it's not just

1484
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,040
uh sulfur rectangle uh

1485
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,839
that's a disguise uh so basically what

1486
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,200
happens is that

1487
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,480
it's it's actually not really it's very

1488
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,480
often it's not even possible

1489
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,680
to solve it for everything so what the

1490
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,680
software actually does is it creates a

1491
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,400
mesh

1492
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,480
now right now i'm going to sort of show

1493
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,319
a very simple mesh

1494
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:25,839
which will just be a rectangular one

1495
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,440
all right so this is

1496
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,559
meshing

1497
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:53,280
and this is sorted for it creates

1498
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,960
as a mesh so over here what

1499
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,200
it actually does is it may not be able

1500
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,880
to sort of solve it for everything

1501
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,559
figure out what it's like

1502
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,319
but it can sort of solve it for each

1503
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,480
point over here so it can solve it for

1504
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,520
this point

1505
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,880
for this point to serve all of these

1506
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:20,640
intersection points

1507
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,160
and so on and so forth i'm not going to

1508
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,160
do all of that um

1509
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,920
now the thing is that actually you have

1510
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,280
different kinds of solvers

1511
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,799
and a lot of them don't just stop at

1512
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:30,640
that so a lot of them do the midpoints

1513
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:31,839
as well

1514
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,280
so like you know you have mid points

1515
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,359
over here of these

1516
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,640
and some of them may even do the

1517
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,760
midpoint of this whole thing

1518
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
so that that sort of varies based on

1519
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,079
solver now the key thing to know here

1520
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,039
is that each of these points is called a

1521
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,720
node

1522
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,720
and sort of each each thing over here

1523
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,240
is called an element

1524
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,839
so each each box

1525
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,480
so each box is an element

1526
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,280
and sort of each point is a node so this

1527
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,119
sort of again depends on your different

1528
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,240
settings and all

1529
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,480
and i will i will sort of go through

1530
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,760
that

1531
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,359
so over here you have your different

1532
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,200
settings and you can sort of see

1533
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,079
with an element and a node so each you

1534
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,680
will obviously always have more nodes

1535
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,200
and you have elements

1536
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,200
uh you you can sometimes have the same

1537
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,359
number of nodes as elements

1538
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,000
and this is certified works so obviously

1539
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,920
you have a lot more complex meshes you

1540
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:36,640
will have

1541
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,799
sort of like exactly meshes and all but

1542
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,240
generally meshing is something you don't

1543
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,920
need to worry about at least definitely

1544
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,799
not with

1545
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:46,000
simple uh simple simulations uh you

1546
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,680
just sort of need to have an idea of

1547
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,119
what your elements are and what your

1548
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:50,319
moods are

1549
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:51,920
because certain softwares actually have

1550
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,440
a limit on the number of nodes you can

1551
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,079
use

1552
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,799
so like for instance uh what is probably

1553
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,480
like the gold standard for simulation

1554
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,079
software is ansys

1555
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,039
and ansys has a free free version of the

1556
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:03,760
software that

1557
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,000
anyone can download and that that one

1558
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
has a limit of i believe 32 000

1559
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,839
nodes and that sounds like a big number

1560
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:15,760
but it's really not you sort of end up

1561
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,359
hitting those kinds of limits quite

1562
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:18,079
quickly

1563
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,400
so it's sort of really important to be

1564
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,079
aware of what your message is like and

1565
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,359
how it goes

1566
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,680
so what your mesh does is it calculates

1567
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,799
exactly

1568
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,960
uh it calculates the results exactly for

1569
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,400
this

1570
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,119
and then and then it sort of spits out

1571
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,039
then it sort of spits out a result

1572
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,039
but i think if any of you guys have seen

1573
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,319
a simulation study

1574
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:41,599
and i will show a simulation study

1575
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,680
you will sort of realize that it sort of

1576
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,359
shows continuous results

1577
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,680
it doesn't it can show you like sort of

1578
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,200
like a colored line

1579
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,200
like you know that color those colors

1580
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,240
may represent like the gradient maybe uh

1581
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,039
like or it may it may be something like

1582
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:57,599
the

1583
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,240
deformation and all and how does it

1584
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,440
really do that so

1585
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:09,839
how it does that is

1586
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:23,839
oh no this is upside down uh

1587
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:27,759
[Music]

1588
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:38,799
okay so it's through the power of

1589
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:41,520
interpolation

1590
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:44,799
now interpolation i'm sure this is

1591
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,079
something that you guys

1592
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,480
would probably be familiar with um if

1593
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,920
you've sort of like you know done your

1594
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,880
graphs and all

1595
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,839
interpolation is just how you connect up

1596
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:55,119
the points in your graphs

1597
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,039
now unfortunately you can't just do like

1598
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,559
a line of best fit

1599
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,119
uh because you know this is being done

1600
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:03,039
by computer you need to have a sort of

1601
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,599
algorithm to really perform this

1602
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,599
so obviously you have your very simple

1603
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:09,280
ones which are linear

1604
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,200
so like let's see if i have these five

1605
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,520
points your linear will sort of be able

1606
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,319
to do

1607
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,079
this kind of interpolation so let's say

1608
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,160
you know if i want to know

1609
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,280
what's at p 1.5 it just sort of looks

1610
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,960
here it takes the point and it's able to

1611
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:23,760
give me

1612
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,079
so because it's all defined in terms of

1613
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,240
different lines different equations

1614
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,079
you can end up getting an exact result

1615
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:31,520
through

1616
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,440
but this isn't necessarily the most

1617
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,520
accurate one so you actually have

1618
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,280
quadratic interpolation

1619
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,880
and that would be if you look at

1620
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,880
something like this so this would

1621
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,839
actually be

1622
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:43,520
um so like for instance over here you

1623
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,599
have five notes and four elements

1624
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,520
this would actually be five notes and

1625
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,799
two elements

1626
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:50,960
so you can think of sort of each line as

1627
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:51,839
an element

1628
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,680
now obviously i'm showing this quite

1629
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,119
simply so this would be

1630
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:56,799
this would actually be for a 1d example

1631
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:57,839
where you're only looking at things

1632
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:58,720
along x

1633
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,160
and actually you'll be looking at things

1634
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,240
along x y and z and that's where you get

1635
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,240
to graphs which are like you know

1636
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,480
in very high dimensions and you can't

1637
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,839
really visualize that

1638
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:09,440
so that's why i just stuck with the 1d

1639
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,960
example and

1640
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,280
over here you can see you have these two

1641
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,160
graphs

1642
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,720
and one key point uh that needs to be

1643
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,039
maintained here is because the quadratic

1644
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,960
you not only have to make sure that

1645
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,119
they're continuous which means that both

1646
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,559
of these points are the same for both

1647
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:25,359
graphs

1648
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,440
you uh you also need to make sure

1649
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,599
they're smooth and that means that the

1650
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,240
tangency is the same so if you sort of

1651
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,079
want to

1652
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,720
uh mathematically describe that it would

1653
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,240
sort of simply be here like

1654
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,160
uh let's say if the red one is f of x

1655
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,400
and the y one is g of x you need to make

1656
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,480
sure that the derivatives at

1657
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,960
point x three are the same

1658
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,640
so over here this would sort of be your

1659
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,319
x three by three

1660
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,359
so you need to make sure that the

1661
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:54,799
derivatives are the same and that

1662
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:57,839
ensures that these are smooth

1663
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,280
so that's that's sort of your

1664
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,200
interpolation and how it's able to get

1665
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,720
smooth results

1666
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,880
and this is this is sort of like you

1667
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,760
know it

1668
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,559
for the theory behind it and i think you

1669
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:09,039
know

1670
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,880
right now i want to reserve some time

1671
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,240
for questions

1672
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,280
and then um you know i think we have we

1673
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:15,599
we

1674
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,120
have 45 minutes so we definitely have

1675
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,120
the time where i can actually sort of go

1676
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,080
into

1677
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,759
a simulation software to sort of give

1678
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:23,120
you an example of a very simple

1679
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,319
simulation

1680
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:25,759
and then you can sort of see what

1681
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,359
happens in each step you know

1682
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,759
what is the whole process required and

1683
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,359
you know hopefully i also don't mess up

1684
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,880
anything along the way

1685
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,799
so yeah i think does anyone have any

1686
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,479
questions um

1687
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,839
anything like that

1688
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,399
all right great so i'm hoping that

1689
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,759
everyone understood

1690
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,198
it's not that nobody uh wants to ask a

1691
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:01,599
question

1692
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,799
so let me open up

1693
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:10,319
francis workbench real quick

1694
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,719
now i would personally not really

1695
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,198
recommend starting off with ansys it's

1696
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:20,560
a bit of a very

1697
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,600
sort of like finicky software but it

1698
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,880
sort of gives you

1699
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,279
the most uh the most clarity and it

1700
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,120
gives you the most

1701
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,198
freedom in terms of what you can do with

1702
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:32,319
the software

1703
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:33,679
so that's why i'm sort of showing the

1704
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,479
example here so this is

1705
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:39,279
you know you'll be using uh sort of like

1706
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:41,279
everything that's come here

1707
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:45,759
uh throughout the throughout each step

1708
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:48,640
all right perfect it started i don't

1709
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,040
need to

1710
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:54,960
all right so here we go so this is

1711
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,320
access workbench

1712
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,440
and over here i can sort of see

1713
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,080
that you have a lot of analysis systems

1714
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:02,960
so imagine

1715
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,560
sort of like what we did in the first

1716
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,080
class but

1717
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,840
you probably need one of those for each

1718
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,120
and every one of these

1719
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,600
and uh and static structure is probably

1720
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,800
the simpler ones

1721
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,360
so that is what we're doing uh one thing

1722
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,080
that's interesting

1723
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,600
to note is that all of these other ones

1724
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,280
are completely different but you have

1725
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,239
transient structure which is uh which is

1726
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,760
something that's quite cool to sort of

1727
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,880
think about

1728
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,800
so let's say i think like with

1729
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,800
simulations let me actually stop sharing

1730
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,679
for a bit

1731
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:32,719
and talk about transient simulations so

1732
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:35,199
you know your static simulations is

1733
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,320
let's say you know like

1734
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:41,040
i have a ball and if i apply

1735
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:45,040
five newtons a force to the ball

1736
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,480
what happens now transient would be the

1737
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,600
equivalent of saying

1738
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,880
i have a ball and now if i'm going to

1739
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,520
kick the ball

1740
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,640
with let's say 10 newtons of force what

1741
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,440
happens

1742
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,239
so transient is essentially you uh

1743
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:03,920
dealing with forces that are constantly

1744
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,360
changing now this may be

1745
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,480
something like the force sort of

1746
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,080
changing direction which would be the

1747
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:08,640
case

1748
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,480
of a kick or it could be a situation

1749
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,920
like let's say maybe you're dropping

1750
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,640
something

1751
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,400
and you're sort of having you're sort of

1752
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,760
having the actual value of the force

1753
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,960
changing over time

1754
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,800
so that is something that is very useful

1755
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,239
for stress testing

1756
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,239
so you know like let's say saying like

1757
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,159
it's very different to sort of

1758
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,560
slowly ramp up a force versus suddenly

1759
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,560
ramping up a force

1760
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,760
and that's something which you can

1761
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,760
definitely see you know it's not it's

1762
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,280
not just that like that for people it's

1763
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,400
also like that

1764
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:39,199
uh for uh for you know everything else

1765
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,520
so over here i sort of have a couple of

1766
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,960
different things i'm really

1767
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,480
worrying about these first three which

1768
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,480
is engineering data geometry and more

1769
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,719
so first let's take a look at

1770
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,480
engineering data because it's

1771
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,719
a relatively simple one over here you

1772
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,320
sort of have your different materials

1773
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,600
i'm not going to bother adding a new

1774
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,199
material but over here you can sort of

1775
01:11:59,199 --> 01:11:59,920
see

1776
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,320
your different material properties so

1777
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,000
for instance you have your density which

1778
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:04,640
is

1779
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,320
i'm sure you guys are all aware of

1780
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,800
density so you'd have density you would

1781
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,640
have elasticity and all

1782
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,239
uh right now this is assuming it's

1783
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,000
isotropic that's why it says isotropic

1784
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,120
elasticity

1785
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,600
uh you would uh you can actually change

1786
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,360
that

1787
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,800
uh then you would have your different

1788
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,960
yield strengths so yield strength is

1789
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,280
sort of if you go back to the diagram

1790
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,800
that would be your fracture point so the

1791
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,960
yield strength is the maximum

1792
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,800
maximum stress it can take before it

1793
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,159
breaks and that's what's really

1794
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:33,600
important that we non-dimensionalize

1795
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,640
this because

1796
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,760
otherwise the yield strength for a sort

1797
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,040
of like a two by four

1798
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,120
block of steel would be different uh

1799
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,640
compared to the yield strength of like

1800
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,320
let's say a steel water bottle

1801
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,760
but now it's sort of the same for

1802
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,000
everything stream so over here you have

1803
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,199
you have all of this information that

1804
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,800
gives you the structural

1805
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,199
uh the structural properties of steel i

1806
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:56,800
can actually add new materials there

1807
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,600
would be

1808
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,760
you know uh i can take i can take

1809
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,360
materials that already exist or i can

1810
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,880
create my own material

1811
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,199
and sort of give all of the values for

1812
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:06,080
it now that's

1813
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,920
not because i'm actually like creating a

1814
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,840
brand new material but also because

1815
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,560
it might not be available in the

1816
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,920
simulation space

1817
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,159
so that's your engineering data and now

1818
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:18,880
here you have geometry

1819
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,920
so geometry ends up being

1820
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,280
another quite simple thing uh

1821
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,120
geometry is just sort of like you know

1822
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,199
defining defining the shape of what you

1823
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,120
want to simulate

1824
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,000
and that would be uh just you know

1825
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,159
having that cad model so you can either

1826
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:38,320
upload something or uh with a lot of

1827
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,239
softwares you can create it

1828
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,718
using

1829
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,120
share um which is

1830
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,360
sort of the cat software that answers

1831
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,040
provides which is basically

1832
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,960
all right perfect so uh you know like i

1833
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,120
can create a model here

1834
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,080
let's say i have a rectangle like this

1835
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,440
make it

1836
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:15,839
25 by 10 millimeters

1837
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,239
one question is this design spark you're

1838
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,239
using here

1839
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:31,360
um no so this is this is space claim and

1840
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,159
it is

1841
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:36,320
uh it's sort of the the design the cad

1842
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,719
the cad modeling uh software that sort

1843
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,239
of comes with ansys

1844
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,120
so actually one one sort of uh top tip

1845
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:43,920
with

1846
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,640
uh with simulations is that you know if

1847
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,239
your cat software can do simulations

1848
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,840
that's great that's perfect that

1849
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,679
sort of makes your life so much easier

1850
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:53,040
but if you're using the cad software

1851
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,640
that can't use simulations

1852
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,960
one thing that i learned the hard way

1853
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,920
and that was just

1854
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,440
spending an entire day completely

1855
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,280
failing to mesh is

1856
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,840
when you're exporting please always

1857
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,719
export in

1858
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:09,360
dot iges so i just file uh let me just

1859
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:14,480
actually even type that out

1860
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,000
because

1861
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,840
so it's dot iges

1862
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,920
uh yeah so that's actually uh that's a

1863
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,120
that's a really good question

1864
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,159
i use step and i i regretted it because

1865
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,840
it led to a lot of topology

1866
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,440
issues and i tried to spend a day

1867
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,679
solving them and then i found out that

1868
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,719
no you igs is just better

1869
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,880
so for for most examples of like you

1870
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,400
know simple geometry and all

1871
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:50,080
step steps should be more than okay

1872
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,000
but yeah when when you're dealing with

1873
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,840
more complicated geometry and

1874
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,320
i want to see so i was actually doing a

1875
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,320
workbench simulation

1876
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,000
on my drone and if i would be able to

1877
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,199
share that

1878
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,719
that would be lovely but i'm not sure

1879
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,960
francis wants to cooperate

1880
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,199
so for now i'll just be doing a very

1881
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:10,159
simple

1882
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:12,159
uh i'll be showing off a very simple

1883
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,799
simulation

1884
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,880
of that so yeah unfortunately it's a bit

1885
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,400
of a slow softness so

1886
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:24,639
you have to see you have to wait a bit

1887
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:35,840
it eventually does come

1888
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,800
not want to cooperate with my challenge

1889
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:54,400
all right there we go let me just

1890
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,280
share my screen real quick so all right

1891
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,920
so now we're in mechanical

1892
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,520
and we have this over here

1893
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,320
now i actually haven't used ansys all

1894
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,199
that much so

1895
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,520
i'm a bit uh sort of awkward with the

1896
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,320
controls

1897
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,679
it's very annoying when you have to sort

1898
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:13,600
of go between different softwares

1899
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,400
and they always manage to make sure that

1900
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,040
the

1901
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,400
the orbit um you know the start

1902
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,679
of the different image

1903
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,280
that's something to deal with so

1904
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,040
actually over here you sort of have the

1905
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:27,920
meshing tool

1906
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,280
so over here you can see a lot of

1907
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,199
different machining things so first and

1908
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,880
the easiest is just sort of the default

1909
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,360
mesh

1910
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,040
for something like this the default mesh

1911
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,040
is always good enough it's nice it's

1912
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,560
quick it gets the job done

1913
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,320
so over here because it's a nice simple

1914
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,760
shape it gave a nice

1915
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,800
sort of easy mesh now

1916
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,159
i can actually sort of change this up so

1917
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,440
like let's see maybe

1918
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,560
if i actually want a like you know

1919
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,560
a lot more refinement over here i could

1920
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,880
actually click on sizing

1921
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,679
i could select this face so over here

1922
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,800
this is not so much

1923
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,719
teaching the software i'm also just

1924
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,080
looking at like different ways we can

1925
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,440
manipulate the mesh

1926
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,679
so i could change this size to like

1927
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:13,440
let's say 0.000

1928
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,400
0.01

1929
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,679
and now i could actually sort of update

1930
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:27,840
this mesh

1931
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,679
that is a bit awkward

1932
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,199
that that's generally why you sort of

1933
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,040
don't try to mess around

1934
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,840
with this let me actually change the

1935
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,080
face and actually just sort of do

1936
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,159
a resizing for the entire thing so i can

1937
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,000
actually do sizing

1938
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:09,840
for this whole object to define the mesh

1939
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,960
i saw my i made it actually

1940
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,400
i ended up making it larger i forgot

1941
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,800
that this was quite a small object

1942
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:24,800
so let's see i think the default size

1943
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,800
and now i can update this

1944
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,440
and yeah so now you can sort of see over

1945
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,520
here it ends up being a bit awkward

1946
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,080
because of how the highlighting is

1947
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,600
uh with that but you can sort of see

1948
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:43,920
where

1949
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:48,320
over here i've changed the mesh sizing

1950
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,880
so that it's a it's a finer mesh and

1951
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,480
let's see over here i could have

1952
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,000
i could change this to like let's see

1953
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,840
maybe just for this face

1954
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,760
i could make that you know maybe even

1955
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,239
smaller

1956
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,480
and let's see hopefully this doesn't

1957
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,360
take

1958
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,839
that long

1959
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:10,719
right now you can sort of see over here

1960
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:13,120
where compared to this

1961
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,880
the rest of it this one is a lot more

1962
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,040
refined and you can see that a lot of

1963
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,080
these

1964
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,480
a lot of these softwares actually have

1965
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,719
uh have sort of soft behavior turned on

1966
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:24,639
which means that you know because over

1967
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,159
here it's so refined

1968
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:30,320
it doesn't sort of suddenly go to

1969
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,040
our normal and it's sort of applied

1970
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,480
around the other faces as well

1971
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,360
to make sure there's uniformity so that

1972
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,280
sort of part automatically has that

1973
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,120
you can just disable that by making this

1974
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,880
hard and now i can

1975
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,199
sort of update the mesh again so you

1976
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:46,800
know there's actually like a lot going

1977
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,199
on in mesh and meshing can just be its

1978
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:52,800
own whole thing but you know

1979
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,639
it's uh like you know there's a lot you

1980
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:56,800
can do and sometimes you can just sort

1981
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,280
of

1982
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,000
zap on a default image so here's where

1983
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,159
we actually get to the fun part

1984
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:03,679
although i've been told my definition of

1985
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:06,320
fun is very sad

1986
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,120
uh and over here is actually where you

1987
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,600
can

1988
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,960
uh you can give all of your forces and

1989
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,440
so let's say we actually want to

1990
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,840
simulate a compression load over here

1991
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,120
so what's um so what's interesting is

1992
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,480
that if you sort of

1993
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:26,320
saw the diagrams for

1994
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,800
a compression load uh we would have we

1995
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,320
would have sort of put a force here and

1996
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:30,880
here

1997
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,400
but what's different is that in a

1998
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,080
software you could actually just put a

1999
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,360
support so over here

2000
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,440
i could have this be a fixed support

2001
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,520
let's say right here

2002
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,000
and that means that this stays too and

2003
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,560
now

2004
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,920
if i add a force over here and

2005
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,120
like this let's say i can make it 10

2006
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,679
newtons

2007
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,040
now that i've applied this force um that

2008
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,480
that is the equivalent of me applying

2009
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,080
this force on both faces because i'm

2010
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,360
keeping this one still

2011
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,120
so the reaction force will always be

2012
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,679
identical

2013
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,520
so actually in this case you can see

2014
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,679
it's a tensile force

2015
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,679
and i'm not sure if you guys can see the

2016
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,040
axes

2017
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,040
but over here because positive is this

2018
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,560
way i would actually want to make it

2019
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,280
negative if it was a compressive force

2020
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,400
and now it's a compressive force so now

2021
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,239
i really have all of the information i

2022
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:23,360
need

2023
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,320
and i can actually solve it directly now

2024
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,320
like i'm actually trying to solve

2025
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,080
and let's see hopefully it's not too

2026
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,559
many minutes

2027
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,239
so we are going into statistics oh yeah

2028
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:37,920
so yeah you can see already just with

2029
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,360
such a simple example

2030
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,400
we exceeded the 32 000 limit so let me

2031
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:42,719
just

2032
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,600
change the sizing so that you know it

2033
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,760
can actually run the analysis

2034
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,000
regenerate the surface mesh

2035
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,960
uh yeah now now the notes are much as

2036
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,880
this is well below 32 000

2037
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:07,840
so i can actually run the solution

2038
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,040
all right and just like that it's been

2039
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,159
solved

2040
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:18,639
so as you can see nothing really looks

2041
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:19,360
different

2042
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,239
but that's because you know actually

2043
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:23,920
having a saltwater uh

2044
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,560
having a sword model is still a lot of

2045
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,560
work so for instance you can

2046
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,080
the simplest thing would probably be to

2047
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,840
look at deformation

2048
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,320
total deformation so you can apply a

2049
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,639
geometry selection

2050
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,320
so let's say i could even just sort of

2051
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,920
apply it over here

2052
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,520
and i could try and see the total

2053
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,120
deformation

2054
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:48,320
and evaluate all results

2055
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,239
and it just shows me the definition over

2056
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:53,360
here so you can sort of see how it goes

2057
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,719
like this and you know this is obviously

2058
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:57,600
a lot more

2059
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,440
um this is you know a lot more technical

2060
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,800
analysis so

2061
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,120
it would be you know you would end up

2062
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,880
having different results it won't be

2063
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,560
nearly as linear so you can see how the

2064
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,320
force is actually changing

2065
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,840
and over here will always be zero

2066
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,600
because it's assuming that this point is

2067
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,360
fixed

2068
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,960
so that's sort of showing how the force

2069
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,040
is propagating along obviously it's a

2070
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,040
very simple example

2071
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,639
so you'll get a very simple result and

2072
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:24,239
you know i could i could have changed

2073
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:26,719
this to uh instead of

2074
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:31,840
stopping numbering geometry selection

2075
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:38,080
let's press this

2076
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,800
and i can change this from geometry

2077
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,199
select

2078
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,239
and i can see sort of the whole result

2079
01:24:58,239 --> 01:24:59,840
throughout the body of course because i

2080
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,199
just applied a force here

2081
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,600
it's very simple but let's say i can go

2082
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,400
back in here

2083
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,360
do my structural thing and i can i can

2084
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,520
afford to make this a bit more complex

2085
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,719
so let's say if i want to in addition to

2086
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:13,120
that

2087
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,600
i want to actually add a force to this

2088
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,639
one

2089
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:20,320
i want to apply it and let's see this

2090
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,520
can be 20 newtons and this is actually

2091
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,080
being

2092
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:27,600
a tensile force and i can

2093
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,400
right now i'm just making this all over

2094
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,560
the surface

2095
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,440
and now i can do a solution and i'll be

2096
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,000
able to get

2097
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,840
a much more complex result

2098
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:45,040
so let's see again it looks like that

2099
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,560
and you can see with total deformation

2100
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,600
you can now

2101
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,760
sort of see how the object's been bent

2102
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,360
and you can look over here

2103
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,280
uh one thing that's quite important to

2104
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,639
note is

2105
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,800
you it's generally not the best idea to

2106
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,159
actually look at the

2107
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,840
look visually at the sort of

2108
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,760
transformations because these are

2109
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,320
usually exaggerated

2110
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,520
so that you can see it better

2111
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,880
it's a lot better to actually look at

2112
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,800
the values so you can see over here

2113
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,320
it's 2.8 times 10 to the minus 7

2114
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,800
meters so that is that is a really small

2115
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:17,360
value

2116
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,040
and that is definitely a lot less than

2117
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,639
what's being shown here

2118
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,159
but you know obviously if you just show

2119
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,560
that much it wouldn't be visible

2120
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,400
so over here i can do that i can even

2121
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,760
add sort of

2122
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,880
uh different different solutions so

2123
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,560
like i could i could potentially look at

2124
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,639
the strain energy in this

2125
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:37,120
so strain energy by default it's applied

2126
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,320
to all bodies

2127
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,560
i can evaluate all results and i can

2128
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,080
actually see the strain energy here

2129
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:48,320
so this just shows uh the world

2130
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,639
thing and over here it's quite it's

2131
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:52,000
again because it's

2132
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,480
been such a simple simulation it's

2133
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,840
everything is sort of coming quite

2134
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:56,560
gridline

2135
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,320
but later when you sort of move on to

2136
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,920
more complex ones where you have proper

2137
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,360
interpolation and everything

2138
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,040
that's uh that's when you'll get more

2139
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,560
complex results in fact

2140
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,080
if i move this precisely let me just

2141
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,880
suppress this

2142
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:14,560
you can start with different things

2143
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,800
you can change the results

2144
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,080
probably we might not but there may be

2145
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,159
some slight difference

2146
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,600
let's see so yeah over here you will

2147
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,440
you'll get these results you'll sort of

2148
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,120
see it looks a lot more different now

2149
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:29,600
here

2150
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,199
instead of being curved it's a lot more

2151
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,360
straight because because of the mesh so

2152
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,040
that's why mesh matters

2153
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,719
you get a lot more regular result like

2154
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:39,040
this now so these are sort of like the

2155
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,000
things you can

2156
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,239
note and additionally you can even do

2157
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:43,280
like uh quite

2158
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,199
interesting stuff you can do probes

2159
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,199
where like over here i can sort of see

2160
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:48,800
the values

2161
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,520
i can actually define a probe so over

2162
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,719
here

2163
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:56,400
i can insert

2164
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,679
all which i want so that's a definition

2165
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:00,639
i can

2166
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:04,000
i can have it be this

2167
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,520
geometry and

2168
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,800
it is sort of actually instead of

2169
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,040
geometry i can have it be based on

2170
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,159
coordinate system

2171
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:17,320
so you know let's say like at x equals

2172
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,800
0.00 because this is all in meters i

2173
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,920
have to make it quite small

2174
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,840
location

2175
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,159
sort of ends up being a bit weird you

2176
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:41,360
can actually define

2177
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,320
a coordinate system over here that ends

2178
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,360
up being a given line

2179
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:51,040
um

2180
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,440
and over here so it creates its own

2181
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,000
origin based on the geometry

2182
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,520
or like let's say

2183
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,960
could have it offset

2184
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,800
so you know like with this you can have

2185
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,639
you can actually change the values so

2186
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:21,440
you know let's say maybe with this i

2187
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,639
wanted to actually be

2188
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:26,639
seven saving so i can

2189
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:29,679
change all of this

2190
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,600
and just sort of have it like that now i

2191
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,040
can change my probe

2192
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:39,360
to be defined by

2193
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,960
coordinate system and the location

2194
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,920
is this one which is just named permit

2195
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:46,880
system

2196
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,239
and now i can evaluate the result

2197
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:52,080
and i can figure out what the definition

2198
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,679
at that point is

2199
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,120
so you can see it sort of like the

2200
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,360
maximum and minimum values of the

2201
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,560
deformation

2202
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,480
and you know obviously again when you

2203
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,560
get into more analytical studies this is

2204
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:06,159
this is really what is useful so you can

2205
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:08,000
see these values

2206
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,639
and that's and then also with groups you

2207
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,320
can easily sort of see where the max and

2208
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,440
min is

2209
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,320
and over here corresponds to this and

2210
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,320
you can sort of get

2211
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,000
you know you can get like nice results

2212
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,560
you know and show that

2213
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,840
so yeah i think that's sort of really

2214
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,239
uh largely been what i've wanted to

2215
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:28,960
cover here

2216
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,120
and i think the rest of the time we can

2217
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,080
serve leave

2218
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,040
for any questions or you know um if

2219
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,159
there's

2220
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:38,400
if we have more time you guys can maybe

2221
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,760
suggest a study

2222
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,159
that but it it has to be relatively

2223
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:43,600
basic that i can do

2224
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:49,840
in 20 minutes but yeah

2225
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:55,280
uh a quick question so did you try

2226
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:58,159
any of open source film telemetry

2227
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,000
analysis software like free cut

2228
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,679
or something um

2229
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:07,280
yeah so actually i i've

2230
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,280
i've only like you know heard some stuff

2231
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,040
about those softwares i could

2232
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,800
have were they actually pretty good um

2233
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,239
but yeah i

2234
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:16,480
i have the lucky opportunity of being a

2235
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,880
student so i'm able to get free licenses

2236
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,480
for a lot of softwares

2237
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,280
and yeah that's why like for instance uh

2238
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,800
it was a bit unfortunate like

2239
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,719
my originally my workshop was actually

2240
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:28,880
going to be on generative design in

2241
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,159
fusion 360

2242
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:32,639
but then like the like a couple of days

2243
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:34,800
after my proposal was accepted

2244
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,920
um fusion 360 just sort of uh nerfed all

2245
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:38,880
free accounts

2246
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,040
so that you couldn't do it anymore so i

2247
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,719
was unaffected because i had a student

2248
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:44,719
license but yeah that's

2249
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:47,199
sort of the unfortunate thing with your

2250
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:50,239
uh with others

2251
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,159
i think your your free softwares are

2252
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:53,760
definitely the open source ones are

2253
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,040
definitely a good way to group

2254
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,199
um and i think they will certainly

2255
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:58,400
develop a lot more

2256
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,080
but yeah i can't i can't personally

2257
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:03,040
comment because i haven't used it

2258
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,679
fortunately

2259
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:13,839
thank you

2260
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:41,840
any other questions

2261
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,800
okay so i think i mean

2262
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,639
there are any questions i can sort of

2263
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:54,159
answer them as they come

2264
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:57,360
or otherwise do you guys have sort of

2265
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:01,360
any any relatively simple study

2266
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,480
that you might want me to attempt

2267
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:09,760
in the next 20 minutes or i think

2268
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,280
i don't know maybe breaking of a stick

2269
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,960
that's super brave let's see

2270
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,320
all right so i'll try my hand at that

2271
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:23,040
that that that sounds like a fun one so

2272
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,159
let me

2273
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:27,280
close mechanical i think it might be

2274
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,840
easy if i just share my whole

2275
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,880
uh desktop

2276
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:37,120
so let me do that and

2277
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,840
so over here you can see sort of like i

2278
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,440
got everything i got the whole model

2279
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,679
setup solution results and all

2280
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,800
so let me just

2281
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,840
scrap this

2282
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,520
all right so i'll create another

2283
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:06,480
static structure geometry

2284
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,239
now unfortunately with this i don't

2285
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:18,000
think you'll be able to

2286
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,080
sort of see the snapping but you'll

2287
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,199
definitely be able to

2288
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:24,080
see the definition so i guess you have

2289
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,600
that

2290
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,159
so what i'm going to have to do for this

2291
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:30,480
is

2292
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,960
first of all i need to make it quite

2293
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,280
long and thin

2294
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:38,480
i wonder if i could actually measure the

2295
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,840
dimensions of this thing i have

2296
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:47,840
calipers in my drawer

2297
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,360
all right no i don't i will have to

2298
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,119
settle for a ruler

2299
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:56,800
um so thickness comes to about 0.5 cm

2300
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,880
and we can make this about 10

2301
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,400
centimeters long

2302
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:14,239
so that would be 5 meters so

2303
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:19,440
it's a 10 centimeters so that can be

2304
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,840
what can i do

2305
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:52,320
or i could actually let's

2306
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:56,480
get this one and

2307
01:35:56,480 --> 01:36:01,199
i'll actually pull this out to be

2308
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,840
50.

2309
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:25,840
see

2310
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,520
and let's hope that these comments two

2311
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,119
separate bodies

2312
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:44,159
so then what i can do is i can actually

2313
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:48,000
sort of keep constrain the center part

2314
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,480
so that you can sort of get a bit more

2315
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,520
of that

2316
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:56,639
snapping action so over here

2317
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:10,880
ah let's see what i should have done

2318
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:21,840
now when i put

2319
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:26,000
sorry i

2320
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,600
okay i think that's very nice

2321
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:35,119
now i can mix it basically

2322
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:49,839
and now let's open this up in mechanical

2323
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:18,159
oh yeah that's the unfortunate thing

2324
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:18,719
about

2325
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:20,400
basically any simulation software you

2326
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,360
have to turn your thumbs

2327
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:32,159
right there we go okay so it is here

2328
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:37,840
all right this is looking pretty good

2329
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,679
and so first let's just

2330
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:44,960
slap on

2331
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,000
the default mesh

2332
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,199
really nothing fancy i need to do for

2333
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:52,800
that

2334
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,320
all right yeah that looks good enough

2335
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,639
let me just check the statistics

2336
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,719
yeah i can actually afford to refine

2337
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:01,280
that a bit

2338
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,840
sooner

2339
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:41,840
now

2340
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:47,519
all right that's much better

2341
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,560
so yeah it's a lot more defined and yeah

2342
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,239
my notes

2343
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:56,080
are well within the limit so now

2344
01:39:56,080 --> 01:40:00,000
what i can try and do here

2345
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:09,840
and first of all

2346
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,080
okay

2347
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,239
all right here i think i'll just have it

2348
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:25,520
be

2349
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,480
effect support

2350
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,719
all right and right here

2351
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:36,880
go force

2352
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,760
i'm going to bring it over here apply

2353
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:40,320
that

2354
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,239
and instead of it being defined by

2355
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:43,920
vector i'll actually make it based on

2356
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,360
components

2357
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,000
so let me see what my axes are so i

2358
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,119
would want this to be

2359
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,180
in the x component

2360
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:52,639

2361
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:55,119
let's make this let's make this hundred

2362
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:55,920
because

2363
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:00,080
i realize now that this is made out of

2364
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:05,600
steel okay i can

2365
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:19,840
change this to work

2366
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,119
um it's that's fine it can be it can be

2367
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:33,119
a steel one why not

2368
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:36,239
um so i can do this and

2369
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:38,000
that should be enough for let me try

2370
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:47,840
something a bit fantastic

2371
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:01,840
intense

2372
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:09,759
all right let's see how that works

2373
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:15,839
put that on a quick solve

2374
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:21,920
what is that the definition is very

2375
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,000
large all right the defamation is very

2376
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,800
large sounds

2377
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:29,199
sounds like good news

2378
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:32,880
and let's just quickly evaluate this

2379
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,719
yeah so it says that the information

2380
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:36,080
otherwise is quite large

2381
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:37,760
so you can see the deformation actually

2382
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,880
comes to 0.249 meters

2383
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:44,480
now i wonder if there's some way to

2384
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:56,800
sort of see the actual deformation

2385
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:00,800
i think it's i'm sure this

2386
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,159
i'm sure there's some way to

2387
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:07,199
see the actual deformation but i

2388
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:09,360
am not aware of it but as you can see

2389
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:12,520
the deformation actually comes to

2390
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:15,199
0.249 which

2391
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:25,839
is quite interesting

2392
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:36,400
it's not giving me the option to

2393
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,840
take the actual value how unfortunate

2394
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:43,440
so yeah this is uh it's not the

2395
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,520
best looking but this is basically sort

2396
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,199
of uh what your

2397
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:49,119
snapping simulation would look like

2398
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:51,040
unfortunately with stuff like ansys you

2399
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,480
won't really get your

2400
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,159
super dramatic results you're going to

2401
01:43:54,159 --> 01:43:55,600
have to realize that

2402
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,760
if this is moving up uh 2.0.249

2403
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,880
uh meters you it will not

2404
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:06,159
survive um so yeah there are

2405
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:08,080
there are other softwares which i think

2406
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,760
like you know some of them need

2407
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,560
give you that snapping but it's a bit

2408
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:13,040
it's

2409
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,800
quite hard to get but you can sort of

2410
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,639
tell with the defamation that

2411
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:21,840
yeah it probably would not survive

2412
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,840
so yeah i think um anything else

2413
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,280
otherwise you know i hope

2414
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,119
i really hope this session has been

2415
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:35,839
useful

2416
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:40,800
yeah it's a good overview

2417
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:46,880
all right then so yeah uh yeah i think

2418
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:49,360
if anyone has any questions we can

2419
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,040
answer those otherwise

2420
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:54,800
uh is it is it okay if we end like about

2421
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,400
10 minutes early

2422
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:59,520
yeah i think that's just fine every

2423
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:03,840
anyone else have questions

2424
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,639
i think it was pretty clear to me the

2425
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:08,000
presentation so

2426
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,840
i'm fine with this yeah safe

2427
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,920
thank you very very very much yeah

2428
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,360
thanks a lot

2429
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,119
all right thanks a lot guys this was

2430
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:19,280
this was a really fun experience and

2431
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:22,400
i hope you guys uh also try out the

2432
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,040
mirror fold uh that's always that that

2433
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,360
never gets old

2434
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:30,910
it's cool i could i could do that

2435
01:45:30,910 --> 01:45:34,120
