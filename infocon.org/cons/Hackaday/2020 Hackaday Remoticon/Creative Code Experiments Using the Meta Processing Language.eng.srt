okay

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,599
so as we get started here i want to

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,280
introduce

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,480
our presenter for today so

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,119
we are very excited to welcome professor

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,800
founder of the hypermedia laboratory

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,039
or high tech lab at the fundacion

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,320
universitaria los libertadores

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,800
he is a visual designer and a phd in

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,960
design and creation from the university

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,200
of

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,079
the caldas he is a promoter of the use

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,079
and development of free software

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,719
for environments like art design and

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,000
entertainment

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,920
his research work focuses on exploring

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,120
strategies to promote

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,879
hacker and maker cultures in the

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,200
university academic context

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,039
seeking that inexperienced people will

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,280
discover the creative opportunities that

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,879
exist when they learn

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,280
to program so please give a warm welcome

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,840
to david

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,720
hi everyone thank you very much to

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,000
to come um i will start sharing my

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,840
my screen

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,000
so um before we start

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,680
i would like to invite you to

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,720
go to this website actually i will i

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,119
will share this in the

35
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,960
in the chat that way you can

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,390
ops

37
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,219
[Music]

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,240
so um

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,360
uh if you didn't download the software

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,560
that we will be talking today so uh

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,640
i will make a brief introduction so this

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,000
will give you time to

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,320
to go to these websites and download the

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,200
software

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,280
also there you you will have the option

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,038
to

47
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,239
download the books with

48
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,280
like the first steps to use this this

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
software

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,680
uh just a small disclaimer

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,480
metaprocessing and meta javascript are

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,200
experimental tools under construction

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,200
so please contact us if you bug

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,760
and it will be we will really appreciate

55
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,840
if you can help us to find them

56
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,519
this will be the topics that we will

57
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,120
speak today uh first we will

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,920
make a short introduction and then we

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,760
will check how to style

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,959
how the interface works and we

61
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,360
start we will start with the experiments

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
so we will

63
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,920
draw uh do few animations

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,360
uh explore a few multimedia instructions

65
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,440
and then we will check how to play with

66
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
arduinos or esp

67
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,959
boards uh so

68
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,800
for the introduction i would like to

69
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
start saying that you don't need to

70
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,200
learn to program just to be an engineer

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,239
as well as

72
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,560
you don't need to learn to write just to

73
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,280
be a poet

74
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,840
today's great dilemma is program or be

75
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,670
programmed so

76
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,820
[Music]

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,319
we stopped since few years we stopped to

78
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:40,640
be

79
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,680
users to become the product and we are

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
delegating to others the responsibility

81
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
to invent in our future

82
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,480
so we became passive consumers of

83
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,319
technologies to create

84
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
so people can do nothing if they don't

85
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,360
have the

86
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,239
adobe suite or a major or unity

87
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,439
so one way of emancipation is through

88
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,120
a creative coding so um

89
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,239
when i say creative coding i refer to

90
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,360
experiment and create programs with

91
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,080
artistic

92
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,920
or recreational propose

93
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,400
i would like to remember the this

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,759
this phrase that the finnish artist erki

95
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,880
kurinemis once said technology won't

96
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,360
trade

97
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,040
won't take control as long men can

98
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,080
misuse it so it's very important to

99
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,440
misuse technology

100
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,880
when we talk about programming language

101
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,040
there are two main types of interfaces

102
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,320
for programming

103
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,440
one based on text and another based on

104
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,280
blocks there are many others but these

105
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,759
are like

106
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,040
the main the main types so

107
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,080
uh in the programming based on text uh

108
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,840
which is used by the majority of

109
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,360
programming languages

110
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,880
each instruction uh must be written

111
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,919
and for this reason there are many

112
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,800
errors of typing and

113
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,160
there is a situation is that almost

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,320
all languages use english language

115
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,600
instructions

116
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,479
uh maybe for for a few of you is this is

117
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,919
not important but

118
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,880
for people like me that english is not

119
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,360
my

120
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,880
main language uh it's sometimes

121
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,120
uh difficult to learn to pro to code

122
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,800
so uh in in in this way

123
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,000
is necessary to know from memory

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,199
the name of each instruction and

125
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,720
its respective parameters when we are

126
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,080
calling based on text

127
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,639
for other hand when we talk about

128
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,960
programming based on blocks

129
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,600
uh we don't have to write the

130
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,639
instructions

131
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,319
so there are less errors of typing

132
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,600
and this kind of environments are

133
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,080
focused

134
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,360
on beginners but they are not used

135
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,199
to create uh complex programs uh

136
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,520
the good thing is they work in multiple

137
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,120
multiple languages

138
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,160
so for example for instance scratch

139
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,639
offer more than 20 different languages

140
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,800
so it's nice for people

141
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,280
like me that we don't speak english so

142
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,000
well so

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,720
we can code in spanish or whatever

144
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,440
meta processing then that is this

145
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,039
project that we developed in the

146
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,800
hypermedia lab

147
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,400
uh is an interface that mix the paradigm

148
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,560
of textual programming and the

149
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,639
programming with blocks

150
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,840
so you just have to type

151
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,240
the values necessary for each

152
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,960
instruction

153
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,000
so uh meta processing is this

154
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,840
experimental prototype of programming

155
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,160
environment

156
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,560
to generate creative code and it was

157
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,280
designed

158
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
especially for artists designers and

159
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,400
beginners

160
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,199
is based on processing language and it's

161
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,120
free software

162
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,000
it works in windows linux and mac and

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,880
you can write

164
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,960
code in 14 languages so it can be french

165
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,479
hindi uh japanese italian

166
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,160
chinese portuguese a few other

167
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,280
languages from india korean

168
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,039
russian german

169
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,319
and meta processing lets you generate

170
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,360
desktop applications

171
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
and also offer you this option to

172
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,919
control arduino and esp boards

173
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,919
like to have communication with them

174
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,919
for other hand meta javascript is a fork

175
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,599
from meta processing

176
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,639
and as its name says

177
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,919
uh is focus in the develop

178
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,879
of uh interactive web pages using

179
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,919
javascript

180
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,879
language uh also working windows linux

181
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,680
and mac

182
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,440
and you can create the code

183
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,560
also in 14 different languages

184
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,599
and the the plus thing of meta

185
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,479
javascript

186
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,919
is that let you run the code

187
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,400
also in your mobile device so you just

188
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,319
have to scan a qr code

189
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,639
that the the interface allows you to

190
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,680
generate this

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,958
qr code or you you type the url

192
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,320
of the application and then you will run

193
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,279
the

194
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,919
the sketch in your in your phone you

195
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,080
just need to have

196
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,160
the computer and your phone connected to

197
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,200
the same router

198
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,399
uh now i would like to check few

199
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,839
differences coding

200
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,680
with some languages so uh

201
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,600
meta processing is based on processing

202
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,920
so that's why i will compare processing

203
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,519
with java

204
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,360
processing uh was very nice when was

205
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,959
created in 2001

206
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,000
in the mit media lab because

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,240
if you just want to draw a line you just

208
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,200
need these

209
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,360
three lines of code and in the left

210
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,600
you can see all the lines of code that

211
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,959
you need to

212
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,680
in java to have the same result

213
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,320
even in python you you need to make so

214
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,360
many lines

215
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,480
to have the same result so processing

216
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,800
was amazing for artists and designers

217
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,920
because

218
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,399
let you sketch your your ideas very fast

219
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,720
but if we compare meta processing with

220
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,519
processing

221
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,320
then you you will see that for instance

222
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,000
if you

223
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,440
if you want to uh

224
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,560
make a project with sound you need

225
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,920
23 lines with meta processing only one

226
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,320
the same with video

227
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,440
and if you want to work with arduino you

228
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,920
will need

229
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,040
all these lines and with a

230
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,839
meta processing only one line

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,200
i am hurting uh

232
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,279
someone no okay great

233
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,600
okay so um there are there are

234
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,640
other other things that i want to

235
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,000
share with you is that uh in processing

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,240
you can use java code

237
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,480
so you can use processing language or

238
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
java code in processing

239
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,279
environment and in meta processing you

240
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:51,920
can use

241
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
processing code java code and meta

242
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,560
processing code so it's they can let you

243
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,680
a lot of options when something is not

244
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,079
created

245
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,360
in meta processing you can use code in

246
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,200
processing or in java

247
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,040
in the same way for meta javascript you

248
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,560
can use javascript to increase

249
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,360
like the options uh for your your

250
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,440
program

251
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,320
uh to start to to code is really

252
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,360
important to

253
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
learn um how are the screen coordinated

254
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,800
uh so uh

255
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,720
in high school we uh learn to work with

256
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,360
the

257
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,279
cartesian cartesian coordinate system

258
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,120
so normally we use the quadrant one

259
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,040
that the x values increase

260
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
um

261
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,480
sorry this thing is

262
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,399
okay so the numbers increasing in the x

263
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,560
uh axis uh from left to right

264
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,800
and the values increase from um

265
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,399
uh one two and 9

266
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,480
from bottom to top in the in the y

267
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,519
axis but encoding

268
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,720
we have to use the

269
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,860
j axis inverted so

270
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,320
[Music]

271
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,519
the values will increase going down

272
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,560
so the idea is that the origin point is

273
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,279
the

274
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,600
top corner in the left so

275
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,959
if you want to make uh to play something

276
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:41,360
in the

277
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,680
in the screen for instance in the

278
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,480
position

279
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,600
400 x and 200

280
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,000
y so you will have to

281
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,680
move down not moving up as you

282
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,959
use to do it in uh

283
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,200
in the regular uh cartesian

284
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,440
system okay now i i would like to

285
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,200
give you a few clues about the

286
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,639
installation of um

287
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
meta processing and meta javascript you

288
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,839
you need to come to

289
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,760
to the urls that i give you so uh

290
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,279
you have this this url

291
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,279
okay releases so uh in this url you will

292
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,000
have

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,040
the three type of files according to

294
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
your operative system you will download

295
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,160
the

296
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,760
the file that you need as you can

297
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
download the books

298
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,600
so um at the end you will have

299
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,079
one of these files according to your

300
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,760
operative system

301
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,160
so i will explain how it works in for

302
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,199
for each one i

303
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,079
i am using linux so if you are in

304
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,120
windows

305
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,320
you and you uh download the file then

306
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,160
you just have to uncompress

307
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,720
the file and then you will have this

308
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,920
folder

309
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,040
inside the folder you will have

310
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,320
uh one one file that is uh

311
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,399
only saying meta processing dot b80

312
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,360
and three folders one is meta processing

313
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,440
others processing and the last one is

314
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,480
projects

315
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,959
okay so to run the program in

316
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,000
in windows after you

317
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,480
unzip the file then you just have to

318
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,279
double click

319
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,519
over over this file if you are in mac

320
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,199
then you will have a similar

321
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,040
folder uh you need to click over the

322
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,120
file

323
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,920
metaprocessing dot command okay

324
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,279
there is an issue that if you are in mac

325
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,720
um you have to get permissions to open

326
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,760
the file

327
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,320
so if it's not opening you have to go to

328
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,360
preferences

329
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,160
and the security options and then it

330
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,279
will appear

331
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,079
that you asking permission for meta

332
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,240
processing you say yes let me open

333
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,519
and then you will be able to open uh

334
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,279
meta processing in mac uh and for linux

335
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,720
is is

336
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,480
very similar to windows you will have

337
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,519
one file in this case this is

338
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,240
metaprocessing.sh

339
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,600
uh you uh double click

340
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,199
i like to to run in terminal in that way

341
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,120
the the third window will be open

342
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,880
and when you um

343
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,680
when it's open you will have this splash

344
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,639
with the

345
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,600
like animation of the name of the lab

346
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
you just close this window and then

347
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,240
meta processing will will appear okay

348
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,440
uh i suggest to don't close this this

349
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,240
window

350
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,079
uh in in in windows and in mac if you

351
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,240
if you close this window it will close

352
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,600
meta processing

353
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,720
in in in linux version i can i can close

354
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,120
this one without closing the

355
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,480
the the main the main window but it's

356
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
very good because uh in this

357
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
in this window you will be able to have

358
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,600
information

359
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,120
of what is going on in the program okay

360
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,160
so um this is like uh

361
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,360
like the introduction of uh

362
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,720
how to style and how to open uh

363
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,880
meta processing i don't know if anyone

364
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,079
already start or have any problem or if

365
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,440
it's working please let me know if

366
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,720
um if

367
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,000
there is any question that

368
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,839
you have in this step i'm only a few

369
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,759
um minutes away from the download and

370
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,519
finishing and i'm on mac os

371
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,640
if anybody if anybody's having trouble

372
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,400
with that operating system

373
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,520
i can look at it and and you open it

374
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,000
without problem or is uh

375
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,359
you are facing those problems no no it

376
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,280
it hasn't finished downloading yet but

377
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,799
it's just a zip file it should be fine

378
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,319
okay okay perfect perfect so yes

379
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,679
uh i will i will continue but uh

380
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,799
just let me know uh and

381
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,559
we can check uh what is what can happen

382
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,760
okay um

383
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,679
okay so let's come back to the

384
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,640
presentation

385
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,440
um so the next

386
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,240
step it's

387
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,480
the interface and main functions

388
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,480
so

389
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,880
um

390
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,000
i don't know how to hide this

391
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,030
it's just moving the presentation anyway

392
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,420
[Music]

393
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,400
in metaprocessing is not like in the

394
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,880
normal

395
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,400
coding environments where you are typing

396
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,240
and if you want to make a new line

397
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,480
you press enter and then you will have a

398
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
new line okay

399
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,559
uh because because here you are not

400
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,520
typing

401
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,799
you just have to make click where is the

402
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,360
word

403
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,880
empty yes and then it will appear this

404
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,160
uh window and will

405
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
offer you like all the instructions that

406
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,520
you can use with the

407
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,960
with the programming uh environment

408
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,000
so they are organized by categories

409
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,280
so you can choose any option of graphics

410
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,280
of properties multimedia

411
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,320
mathematics or the options for playing

412
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,039
with

413
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,320
arduino or esp boards

414
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,960
also you will have this advanced

415
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,000
instruction

416
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,160
to add native code so

417
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,799
if this one is meta processing though

418
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,799
you will be able to add

419
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,480
java code or processing code there

420
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,440
using that option

421
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,919
this is really important in the

422
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,080
interface in

423
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,840
the bottom of the interface you will

424
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,120
have this

425
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,160
great rectangle in this gray rectangle

426
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
you always will have

427
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,280
information about

428
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,000
how works every instruction so you just

429
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,039
have to place your

430
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,240
your mouse cursor over the uh

431
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,400
instruction that you don't remember that

432
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,039
what does the first parameter the second

433
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,880
parameter the third parameter

434
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,480
so you just uh move the the mouse there

435
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,960
and in the bottom of this the interface

436
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
you will have the information that then

437
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
you know that the first parameter is the

438
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,000
image name

439
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,880
the second parameter is the x position

440
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
uh the third parameter

441
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,600
is the y position yes so it's very nice

442
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,640
that you always be

443
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
checking down that way you will have

444
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,679
like a few clues

445
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,720
uh how to use uh meta processing

446
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,799
uh to add a new line of code

447
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,520
as you you are not typing so enter will

448
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,880
not work

449
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,280
you have to move the cursor of your

450
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,159
mouse

451
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,360
until the end of the

452
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,120
instruction uh if if

453
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
you just have empty so you just move the

454
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,200
cursor until the end of

455
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,400
the the word empty and then we'll appear

456
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,640
a green circle with a plus inside

457
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,760
and you press over that button and then

458
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,960
it will appear a new new line

459
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,200
in this case you can see there was two

460
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,000
lines

461
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,120
i go with the i went with the with the

462
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,520
mouse cursor to the end of the line

463
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,720
the green circle appear i click

464
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,039
and then down you can see that there is

465
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,559
the third line and says

466
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,799
empty so then you may click in empty and

467
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,720
you will have all the categories and

468
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,520
choose the

469
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,520
instruction that you want to to use

470
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,320
uh the same is for for the lead every

471
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,440
every line uh after it appears

472
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,360
the green circle if you keep moving more

473
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,480
to the right your your mouse cursor

474
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,000
will appear a red circle if you press

475
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,080
there then it will delete that line

476
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,840
also you will know that it's like for

477
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,600
delete because also

478
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,799
it draws a line over all the

479
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,799
all the code lines so then you will know

480
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,559
that it will delete

481
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,600
all that line so you can see that the

482
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,679
doing click there you have at the end

483
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,480
only one line

484
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,720
okay so i don't know if you you already

485
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,600
have the um

486
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,280
you restart the the the software

487
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,320
but anyway we will we will start to play

488
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,640
with

489
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,919
the meta processing if

490
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,200
you need later more explanations

491
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,559
please feel free to ask me

492
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,520
so uh i will open

493
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
again

494
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:55,840
i'll move this thing

495
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,960
uh david sorry to interrupt but you're

496
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,840
mute

497
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,200
so sorry yes okay

498
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,240
now can you hear me yes

499
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,159
okay great so um here you can see that

500
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,400
you have these tabs and

501
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,159
every tab is to place code

502
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,559
so here you will be able to place the

503
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,159
code for the mouse

504
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,360
for the keyword for the configuration

505
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,640
uh normally we'll use we will use the

506
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,559
type of principle main

507
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,520
uh so as i was saying before that you

508
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,120
were not hitting me

509
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,760
uh if i move the mouse over the lines

510
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,200
you will be able to see

511
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,679
here in the great rectangle down

512
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,159
all the information of the instructions

513
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,039
okay

514
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,039
if you want to run this code that is

515
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,320
coming by

516
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,039
by default as example you just have to

517
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,960
come here to the button

518
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,840
that is a triangle and you can see that

519
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,799
down in the

520
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,559
in the rectangle down the bottom of the

521
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,039
screen

522
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,760
you will see run so every time you move

523
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,120
the mouse it will give you the

524
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,640
information the name of

525
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,320
each uh icon okay of the interface

526
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,880
something that that is very cool is that

527
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,039
i can see this code

528
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,320
in hindi and also all the interface

529
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,720
immediately changed to hindi

530
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,679
i can see the code in in my in my

531
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,400
language in

532
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,799
spanish i can see this code in russian

533
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,000
yes so let's keep working in english but

534
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,440
uh now you can see how how it works

535
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,520
uh you just come here to this icon

536
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,159
that is the language icon and then you

537
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,039
will have like the 14 languages that

538
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,640
you can use okay so

539
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,080
to run the code you just play here make

540
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,520
clicky over the triangle

541
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,039
you will wait a few seconds and then it

542
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,760
will appear a new window in this case

543
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,720
this

544
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,919
code the only thing he does is

545
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,559
uh change the background from black to

546
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,440
white

547
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,080
slowly okay so only with these two lines

548
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,210
you are doing that

549
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,329
[Music]

550
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,400
effect uh if you

551
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,520
if you have opened the terminal also let

552
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,799
me

553
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,679
open here the terminal you will see that

554
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,520
every time i play i play the triangle

555
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,120
here's you can see that it was executed

556
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,559
the code okay so it's a good way to

557
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,200
to know if it's working or not okay

558
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,400
uh

559
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,880
so right now the idea is that we will

560
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,200
make a new

561
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,720
a new project so we will use this icon

562
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,399
that is this one with the plus

563
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,520
if you press window will open

564
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,120
and then you just you can choose the

565
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,880
name for your project

566
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,880
so i will say draw

567
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,000
one and i will say apply and

568
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,640
and you can see that the the top of the

569
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,360
interface

570
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,600
change the name now it's saying draw one

571
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
so you can know now

572
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,200
the name of your project and

573
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,559
you will have all the tabs with zero

574
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,720
with no instructions only with empty

575
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,039
empty empty empty

576
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,080
i will keep here in in the principal tab

577
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,679
and i will press empty and then i have

578
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,919
all this in this new window

579
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,559
all the options let's start with the

580
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,159
background let's change the background

581
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,000
color so i will come to the

582
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,320
instruction background in the properties

583
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,080
menu uh i will have this window that

584
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,600
i have the this tool to

585
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,039
select the color here you can see

586
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,840
green and red but maybe you want to

587
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,960
select blue

588
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,960
so you can move this slider and change

589
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,720
the the the colors that they are display

590
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,840
in the in the tool so let's say i want

591
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,360
this blue here

592
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,039
and then i press select okay

593
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,080
something very nice with this

594
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,279
system is that uh in other programming

595
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,480
languages

596
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,000
you have to know

597
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,880
the rgb uh

598
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,919
like a code the excel decimal uh

599
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,520
code of your color and

600
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,559
if you see ff16 1

601
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,000
e f d it doesn't have any any sense for

602
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,440
any human but here you can see

603
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,880
a blue square so it's showing you

604
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,480
that hexadecimal number

605
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,720
which color represent so it's very nice

606
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,760
because then you know that the

607
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,960
background will be blue

608
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,120
okay despite that maybe you don't know

609
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,080
what means the

610
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,799
letters in hexadecimal so it's quite

611
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,600
nice

612
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,039
now you can press play and then you will

613
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,080
have this window

614
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,159
it will this window will open and you

615
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,159
will have

616
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,760
the background blue yes this is not big

617
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,799
uh advanced because processing or

618
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,600
already let you do this kind of things

619
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,640
so

620
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,240
um later we will see

621
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,440
like a more differences

622
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,440
meanwhile i i just want to show you uh

623
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,240
like how to explore the different

624
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,840
options

625
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,039
now let's try uh let's draw a line

626
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,520
so i will press here in the green in the

627
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,640
grip button you know

628
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,840
i come with a mouse and i move the mouse

629
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,360
move the mouse until the end

630
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,919
and then appear the the green one if i

631
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:24,880
keep moving to

632
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,240
my right the mouse then the uh

633
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,039
red button will appear as you can see

634
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,919
that here

635
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,000
in the first line if you move close to

636
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,200
the one

637
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,120
there will be a a gray button also

638
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,480
this one is a new

639
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,399
new function that i just had one week

640
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,960
ago because i realized that

641
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,799
you can add lines down but sometimes

642
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,200
you need to put a line before background

643
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,880
like oh i forgot to

644
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,679
make a comment like to explain the code

645
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,159
so

646
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,519
for that do that you come here and press

647
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,120
the green and then you will move all the

648
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,799
code down and then you will have the

649
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,080
option to put

650
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,880
a line a new line in the top of the code

651
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,200
so i will delete this because

652
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,440
we don't need it so uh i will add

653
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,720
a new line here after putting the

654
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,399
background blue

655
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,159
and let's draw a line so i will select

656
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:26,640
here

657
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,240
in the graphics category the

658
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,440
the line option and then you can see

659
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,399
there are

660
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,919
four options the first option is for

661
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,960
exposition of of

662
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,760
of the first point you know for to draw

663
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,600
a line you need two points

664
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,960
okay and every point requires x and y

665
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,519
positions so this is the x and y the

666
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,399
first posit

667
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,760
the first point and the x

668
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,679
and y of the second point so i will say

669
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,640
that i want that this is starting the 50

670
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,519
in

671
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:09,039
x 15 in y the first

672
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,480
point of the line and the new point will

673
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,679
be in the 500

674
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,279
500 i will say apply

675
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,559
and then you will see that uh

676
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,880
all the instruction is like line and you

677
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,159
can see down that

678
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,080
the first uh parameter is

679
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,679
x for the point one yeah

680
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,399
y for the point one yes so it's very

681
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,200
nice

682
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,080
i will play this and

683
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,480
now you can see the line the line is raw

684
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,000
so great uh but

685
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,480
i don't like that blue line maybe i want

686
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,080
the line in other color

687
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,399
so what i can do is add a new line

688
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,760
before

689
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,960
and i will choose a property

690
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,120
that is the line color so i will choose

691
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
the line color and i will say i want

692
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,799
that the line will be white

693
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,000
so i can use here this this

694
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,440
this slider here in the top is to choose

695
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,880
uh rgb colors but if you want to use a

696
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,919
grayscale color between

697
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,679
color no a tone from black until white

698
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,640
then you have this other slider and and

699
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,120
here

700
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,880
appear the color that you are choosing

701
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,559
so you can go from black

702
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,600
to gray to white

703
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,279
okay i will say select so

704
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,679
now i will run i have background blue

705
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,960
line color white

706
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,480
and draw this line

707
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,799
so then you can see that is drawing the

708
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,880
the line

709
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,200
with white color over the blue

710
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,000
background

711
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,039
okay uh i i don't know if i am going so

712
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,519
fast please let me know if

713
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,799
um you are following what

714
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,559
i am trying to share with all you

715
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,320
but still is very basic let's

716
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,159
let's play with other shapes so i will

717
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,200
i will draw a rectangle

718
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,399
uh in this case i

719
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,199
have also four four parameters

720
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,599
the first two parameters is the position

721
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,399
where i will

722
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,199
draw the the rectangle and the other two

723
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,399
is for the width

724
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,600
and the height of the rectangle

725
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,159
[Music]

726
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,199
something that is important is that the

727
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,320
rectangle

728
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,440
always is drawn from the corner

729
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,040
the top corner the the left top corner

730
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,239
of the rectangle okay so so the

731
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,040
the reference is is the corner okay the

732
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,320
top corner

733
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,400
so let's say that i want to draw in the

734
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
position 50 50

735
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,720
the same place where it's starting the

736
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,119
the

737
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,760
line or actually i can i can start for

738
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
the from the end of the line so

739
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,119
500 500 it will be nice 500 500

740
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,560
500 okay and for the width

741
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,079
i will make a small square so 100

742
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,200
pixels of width and 100 pixels of

743
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,880
height apply okay

744
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,280
so you can see that actually i'm not

745
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,320
writing code

746
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,400
i am just selecting options in windows

747
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,520
so i will play this code

748
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,560
and then uh the rectangle

749
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,640
starts at the end of the line okay

750
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,079
uh but if you can see now the

751
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,640
the the rectangle is also it's also

752
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,440
white

753
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,040
this is because uh we define here white

754
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,880
ah no the the the rectangle

755
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,480
have background and align

756
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,119
around the rectangle so

757
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,560
if i change the line color before before

758
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,759
drawing the rectangle

759
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,040
then it will be possible to see

760
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,150
that so i will put uh

761
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,200
[Music]

762
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,640
i don't know this kind of pink

763
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,280
so then you will you will be able to see

764
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,480
that

765
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,160
the line is um

766
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,119
white and i don't know because

767
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,560
broadcasting is

768
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,200
it should be more pixelated here in my

769
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,040
computer i can see the pink maybe you

770
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,920
can

771
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,839
see the difference

772
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,280
but let's change the background of the

773
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,800
rectangle before

774
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,920
before drawing the the rectangle so

775
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,960
i will choose um

776
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,280
the fill option here the third one in

777
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,119
properties

778
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,000
uh and i will say that the i wanted the

779
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,359
rectangle be

780
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,119
green select so i will

781
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,160
run the code so the line will be white

782
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,359
the border the border because i delete

783
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,598
that

784
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,800
that line before now the border of the

785
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,000
rectangle is possible to

786
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,200
see that is white and the

787
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,000
fill of the rectangle is green so

788
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,079
in the same way you can keep doing

789
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,000
experiments with the other shapes you

790
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,640
can draw

791
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,040
a circle so with destruction ellipse

792
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,480
ellipse you can do exactly

793
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,880
as with the rectangle there is one

794
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,760
difference

795
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,880
and is that with the ellipse the the

796
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,119
position is not in the corner it's in

797
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:05,920
the center

798
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,680
of the ellipse okay

799
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,160
so let's say that we want the ellipse in

800
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,759
the position 700

801
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,960
700

802
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,560
of with 150

803
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,000
because i don't want that will be a

804
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,920
perfect circle i will make

805
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,440
like some kind of egg so i will apply

806
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,640
and i will run this code the ellipse

807
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,280
will be green also

808
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,520
uh

809
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,040
if i want if i

810
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,240
that the ellipse will the the

811
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,200
egg will be like this then we have to

812
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,000
invert

813
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,359
the the numbers 150 here

814
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,560
and 100 here

815
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,839
apply

816
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,400
okay uh also you can see that as

817
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,040
i define before green background it will

818
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,920
keep green background for all the shapes

819
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,480
so

820
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,720
uh something that we have to be sure is

821
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,480
that we choose the background before

822
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,960
draw the shape so in this case if we

823
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,240
don't want that the ellipse

824
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,440
will be green we should add uh

825
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,440
instruction of fill

826
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,440
so let's say that it will be red

827
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,119
so the rectangle will be filled with

828
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,160
green and in this case the ellipse will

829
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,520
be filled with

830
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,079
bread so let's run the code

831
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,240
so there you have

832
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,880
but i don't know maybe maybe i don't

833
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,680
like that

834
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,680
that white line around the the

835
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,359
ellipse or even around the

836
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,319
square so there is one instruction that

837
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,760
you can use before

838
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,079
drawing the these shapes that you can

839
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,599
add here and

840
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,000
it's saying that no border in that way

841
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,200
you will not have that

842
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,160
that line around the the shapes so i

843
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,880
will choose this option i don't have to

844
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,280
uh give any parameter i am just saying

845
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,119
don't

846
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,160
draw the border in the shapes so if i

847
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,079
run again this code

848
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,200
then you will see that

849
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,440
the square and the circle

850
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,800
and now they don't have this white board

851
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,560
okay uh i don't know if

852
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,040
you already be able to download the

853
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,000
software

854
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,480
if it's opening i don't know if andrew

855
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,319
was able to

856
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,760
download the software it's working

857
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,760
it's working okay great

858
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,720
uh david i've managed to install

859
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,200
everything but now i'm having issues to

860
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,480
run the

861
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,760
program so like i'm following along i've

862
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,520
created the background and the line and

863
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,280
everything and then when i click on

864
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,040
the play button nothing happens

865
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,800
okay so um

866
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,280
you download the uh meta processing or

867
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,359
meta javascript version

868
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,920
i've downloaded both and i've started

869
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,240
the meta processing one

870
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,280
okay and uh

871
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,839
you you have you have the terminal and

872
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,599
and it's appearing uh

873
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,520
messages every time you press that

874
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,319
triangle yeah

875
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,880
but it's not opening the window no it

876
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,440
doesn't

877
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,880
and um in my dock at the bottom i'm on

878
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,160
i'm on a mac

879
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,240
and in my pocket at the bottom there is

880
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,560
a java icon that appears and then

881
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,280
disappears instantly

882
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,800
uh okay so i guess

883
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,760
i guess you are having trouble with java

884
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,319
uh

885
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,440
in order in order to like uh to continue

886
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,079
it it will be more easy for you i

887
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,280
suggest that

888
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,160
try with meta javascript and then all

889
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,280
the code will run

890
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,760
in your browser so if you are facing

891
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,520
problems in this moment with

892
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,720
java i suggest try to use them

893
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,400
because the interface is almost the same

894
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,480
actually actually i will i will stop

895
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,599
here and i will

896
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,880
i will show you how is uh meta meta

897
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,000
javascript

898
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,240
so in that way we can compare what we

899
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,680
are having right now

900
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,319
and then i guess you will have less

901
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:42,960
issues

902
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,000
in mac no problem thank you okay

903
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,280
great yeah i've noticed too so i'm on

904
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,920
the same we're we're both on mac os mojo

905
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,480
javi

906
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,880
so we have the same thing um i think

907
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,040
you're right david it is a java issue

908
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,839
not a problem with meta processing or

909
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,200
mac os

910
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,720
because there's that weird thing where

911
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,680
oracle's versus apple's version of

912
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,079
java is always out of sync and so yes

913
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,800
it's much more important yes but i uh

914
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,520
for

915
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,680
in the way that we can like a practice i

916
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,960
guess it's more fast

917
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,800
just shift to to meta javascript

918
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,880
so let's do it let's go

919
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,520
i will i will now open my meta

920
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,400
javascript so it's very similar

921
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,720
to open meta javascript and meta

922
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,000
processing

923
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,359
uh i like to run with terminal

924
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,480
so um

925
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,839
there you have the splash closest flash

926
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:48,079
great uh meta javascript by default

927
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,599
it will open this example

928
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,720
uh this gives you more interaction so it

929
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,000
will be more nice

930
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,040
if you play in the triangle what will

931
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,400
happen is that it's running

932
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,680
uh in your browser and

933
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,480
if you move the mouse then you can see

934
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,160
that there is a line circle

935
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,359
and square that they move following your

936
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,160
mouse

937
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,520
okay so i hope

938
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,560
if you uh if

939
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,680
clemens can open meta javascript and try

940
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,839
the

941
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,160
this first sketch example sketch

942
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,119
and i i hope it will work

943
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,000
i'm trying but weirdly enough it is

944
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,680
trying to open

945
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,160
java

946
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,079
for some reason even with meta

947
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,800
javascript

948
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,760
the point is that uh meta javascript um

949
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,000
is also developed using processing so

950
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,960
actually is

951
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,480
is is java behind okay

952
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,640
so um

953
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,000
i i would like to to see the

954
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,520
uh the error because uh

955
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,079
in that way i can have more information

956
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:14,390
to

957
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,760
[Music]

958
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,640
to give you a few clues when i when i

959
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,440
use this

960
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,280
this software with my students that also

961
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,520
have mac sometimes they have

962
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,520
issues but uh

963
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,400
i guess right now i don't have enough

964
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,560
information to tell you what is

965
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,440
happening um

966
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,119
i'm trying to sorry i closed the example

967
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,040
one i just reopened one which is a

968
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,839
background

969
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,680
what's the best way to show you what's

970
00:45:51,680 --> 00:46:01,839
going on

971
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,119
in the in the window uh this

972
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,680
i don't know if in in when i try on mac

973
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,240
it was

974
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,000
like a white window i don't know if all

975
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,800
the mags are the same uh

976
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,040
you will have this kind of information

977
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,839
when you

978
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,280
uh clicking run in

979
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,440
except the code you are having that

980
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,880
information

981
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,200
i do okay

982
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,240
but it's not opening the browser no

983
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,800
i i do have errors at the bottom though

984
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,520
um i guess let me just

985
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:57,839
maybe take that in it's not any longer

986
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,920
andrew do you think that maybe if she

987
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,640
reinstall java it will maybe

988
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,400
help her to solve the problem

989
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
i'm not sure if restarting java is the

990
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,520
issue so much as

991
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,480
making sure that the version that's

992
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,920
installed

993
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,599
is the correct one which would that

994
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,280
would be a matter of going this

995
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,520
to your system preferences and like it's

996
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,599
usually down near the bottom left

997
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,520
the java icon and um

998
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,960
off the top of my head i don't remember

999
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,720
the exact steps to

1000
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,440
update your your mac os java but it's uh

1001
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,599
yeah sorry i was just you could give

1002
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,440
people offering but

1003
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,319
yes because actually what what i was

1004
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,480
trying when when i make the packages

1005
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,559
the package of meta processing is that

1006
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,079
the java is include so

1007
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,839
actually she this this problem shouldn't

1008
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,280
be happening so

1009
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,880
i am not sure what is going on

1010
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,240
um andrea you having the same issues

1011
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,040
uh i'm still opening meta javascript i i

1012
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,720
opened meta processing and it

1013
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,760
uh it seemed to work

1014
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,319
properly so it did take a long time for

1015
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:20,960
it to

1016
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,079
start up but once it did it was the play

1017
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:35,839
button more time

1018
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,839
so um i don't know if we keep uh

1019
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,520
going and uh

1020
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,040
yeah yeah yes because i'll follow along

1021
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,800
with my boy

1022
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,440
i guess maybe at the end we can check

1023
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,720
and

1024
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,079
try to solve uh

1025
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,280
see which which is going on

1026
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,359
yes yes anyway so uh

1027
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,680
if i if i open meta processing and meta

1028
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,119
javascript

1029
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,599
at the same time you will see that both

1030
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,440
have like a

1031
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,720
very similar interface

1032
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,760
okay the only difference between

1033
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,680
between meta javascript and meta

1034
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,800
processing

1035
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,160
is that you have these two icons

1036
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,559
uh with this this icon you can

1037
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,280
generate a qr code of this project

1038
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,839
so you can see now there is this image

1039
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,160
also down you have the http

1040
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,760
uh url like uh with the ip address

1041
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,880
and the port and the name of this

1042
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,839
project

1043
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:56,720
and if i scan this code in my phone

1044
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,800
okay i will i open my my qr code scanner

1045
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,599
here

1046
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,960
so i will scan this code it will appear

1047
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,079
like uh the the the same url like a

1048
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,680
192

1049
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,760
i open this in my in my browser and then

1050
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,040
i have the

1051
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,400
the meta javascript uh sketch running in

1052
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,359
my phone

1053
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,119
okay but my phone and my computer

1054
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,240
are connected to the same router okay

1055
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,359
if if i am using the the internet uh

1056
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:38,640
plan of my phone then

1057
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,920
the ip address will be not much because

1058
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,920
they will be in different networks

1059
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,000
so you have to be sure that you are

1060
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,160
using the same wi-fi connection

1061
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,200
your phone and your computer and in that

1062
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,359
way you will be able to see

1063
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,760
test sketch not running in in the

1064
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,200
browser in your computer

1065
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,720
instead you will see running in your

1066
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,760
browser in your phone okay so this is a

1067
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,720
good thing

1068
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,880
with meta javascript because all the

1069
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,240
code is java

1070
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,599
javascript so uh

1071
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,760
phones uh that they have like uh

1072
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,880
updated web browsers

1073
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,960
that can't run javascript then

1074
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,440
it will be like an app that you don't

1075
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,000
have to

1076
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,040
style you just scan the code and then

1077
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,640
you will run the code

1078
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,920
in your phone uh and almost all the

1079
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,599
options

1080
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,720
will work like a very smoothly and like

1081
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,480
uh

1082
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,319
almost you will have the same experience

1083
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:45,280
as in the screen of your computer

1084
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,319
the only situation is like the size of

1085
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,079
your screen so it will look

1086
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,480
different in the computer you can see

1087
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,319
like a more

1088
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,040
more information but anyway you can you

1089
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,839
can develop

1090
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,400
apps with this radio of size of the

1091
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,280
screen so

1092
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,520
it will be very nice if you want to

1093
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,400
develop

1094
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,599
like a mobile apps

1095
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:15,119
and uh the other the other uh

1096
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,839
icon is this called refresh

1097
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,040
the idea is that you scan the code only

1098
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,760
one time

1099
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,000
okay because you already have you

1100
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,280
already have the

1101
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,480
the the url in your phone

1102
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,040
so to don't keep scanning the code again

1103
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,760
and again

1104
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,119
you just refresh the server and and you

1105
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,359
then you refresh uh the app in your

1106
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:40,559
phone the the

1107
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,160
the url and you will have the the the

1108
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,760
updates so you modify the code refresh

1109
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,559
and then you have the option to see the

1110
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,400
changes in your phone only refreshing

1111
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,760
your browser

1112
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,960
so that's why is that

1113
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,680
that icon or if you want always to scan

1114
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,319
the code

1115
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,240
every time you scan the code he

1116
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,839
refreshed the server

1117
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,640
because uh what is making uh meta

1118
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,680
javascript

1119
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,480
is creating like a small web server in

1120
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,680
your computer

1121
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,839
and you are accessing you from your

1122
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,079
phone to that web server

1123
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,280
okay so

1124
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,319
uh this is the only difference almost

1125
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,920
all the instructions

1126
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,079
in in meta processing and meta

1127
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,440
javascript are

1128
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,000
the same there is only one difference i

1129
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,839
will i will show you both

1130
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,800
what options here in that way you will

1131
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,440
be able to see both

1132
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,319
so uh both have the graphics the

1133
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,760
properties

1134
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,640
the multimedia options and the

1135
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,559
mathematics

1136
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,160
even the arduino are the same but

1137
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,480
in meta javascript you will he you will

1138
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,079
have the option to use

1139
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,520
hyperlink and that way you can like uh

1140
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,359
if you may click with the mouse

1141
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,319
uh go to google or go to any website you

1142
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:02,800
can

1143
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,240
make a hyperlink hyperlink and

1144
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,359
also you can use the parameters

1145
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,240
in the url especially if you want to

1146
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:12,880
develop

1147
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,200
apps that one up speak with the other

1148
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,760
app so you can send messages

1149
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,880
uh using the the url path

1150
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,880
so this is like for more advanced like

1151
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,800
and it's possible only in this html

1152
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,920
environment so these two lines are

1153
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,960
the only different the other options are

1154
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,839
the same

1155
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,880
so um uh

1156
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,680
for me uh the version of meta processing

1157
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,160
is more

1158
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,640
stable

1159
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,760
so i i would like to come back to meta

1160
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,400
processing

1161
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,520
i will close meta javascript

1162
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,160
so you can see that whatever i explain

1163
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,160
in meta processing is exactly the same

1164
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,839
in meta javascript

1165
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:05,040
uh in this one when i run

1166
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:10,000
the the the app it's opening a

1167
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:14,799
window as an app for for your computer

1168
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:18,079
according to your operative system so

1169
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,119
uh even if you want to export the app

1170
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,640
you have this uh

1171
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,559
icon here and and it will let you

1172
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,160
export uh uh

1173
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,520
binary uh so it's very nice if

1174
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,040
you like the result you you get in your

1175
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,319
code

1176
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,119
then you can share with other people the

1177
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,599
the app

1178
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,040
uh we have we have these these other

1179
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,799
buttons here this one

1180
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,000
with like a folder with the

1181
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,040
magnify lens

1182
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,079
that is the data icon

1183
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,319
if you do click you will open the data

1184
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,799
folder every project have this

1185
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,440
data folder the idea is that in the data

1186
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,359
folder you can place

1187
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,559
the pictures the sounds like

1188
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,040
the videos the external material that

1189
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:13,920
you want to

1190
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,040
add to your project so

1191
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,480
um if you press if you press this button

1192
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,319
you will open that

1193
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,200
folder and we you will be able to place

1194
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,200
them

1195
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,040
there the files

1196
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,079
also uh this is this is the the

1197
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,160
structure of the project

1198
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,640
so i want to show you here if i say

1199
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,200
export

1200
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,559
then appear this new new folder that is

1201
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:44,960
called

1202
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,079
app okay so here

1203
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,400
it will be your binary app so you just

1204
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,359
have to share

1205
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,520
if you want to share your your creation

1206
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,280
with your friends you just have to share

1207
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:55,839
this

1208
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,359
this folder and in windows there will be

1209
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,160
a x for

1210
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,200
x e x e

1211
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,240
file or a

1212
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,078
in mac it will be also a binary

1213
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,400
application so it's it's very nice

1214
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,119
because then you will have

1215
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,960
like your own distribution of the

1216
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,240
software that you created

1217
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,359
uh there is one button that i didn't

1218
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,359
set but it's very important that is this

1219
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,680
one the the floppy disk

1220
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,040
that is for safe if i am making changes

1221
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,839
before close uh meta processing meta

1222
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:36,960
javascript

1223
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,839
please click here because if you don't

1224
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,880
press

1225
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,920
save you will lose all your changes

1226
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,839
okay and

1227
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,440
the last the last icon in in this

1228
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,200
introduction is is the settings so

1229
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,440
you can open here your configuration

1230
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,480
window you can decide if you want to see

1231
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,359
your code

1232
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:06,839
as a window or you can see the code full

1233
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:08,319
screen

1234
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,319
you can decide the speed if you are

1235
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:11,680
making an animation

1236
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,599
how many frames per second you want to

1237
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,839
use

1238
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,760
you can check if there is a new version

1239
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,880
of

1240
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,240
processing so here is uh

1241
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,960
showing you which is the last version

1242
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,599
published

1243
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,960
so if someone have uh old version of

1244
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,920
processing they will have a different

1245
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,319
name

1246
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,960
here and different name here here both

1247
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,559
are the same is because

1248
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,480
uh this is the last version and it's

1249
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,319
checking in internet and it's the last

1250
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,599
version

1251
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,079
uh if you realize that your version is

1252
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:44,720
old

1253
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,240
and you want to download the new version

1254
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,240
then you can press here where it says

1255
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,720
website and it will take you to the

1256
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,359
website

1257
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:52,960
and then you can download the new

1258
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,720
version uh

1259
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,520
this one is very useful later when we

1260
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,319
will be

1261
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,119
playing with the arduino uh this will

1262
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,040
let you to choose the port of your

1263
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,319
arduino

1264
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:08,240
in that way you be sure

1265
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,520
that here is your arduino port

1266
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,240
with the plus and minus you can choose

1267
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,319
different ports in your computer

1268
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,720
until you find which is the port of your

1269
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,920
arduino

1270
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,200
or if you are using an esp board yes

1271
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,079
this one for

1272
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,119
internet of things uh then you just need

1273
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,559
the ip address

1274
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,599
of the of of the board

1275
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,240
so you will place the ip address here

1276
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:34,720
okay

1277
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,920
so uh this we will use this later but

1278
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,400
it's good that you know that all these

1279
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,559
options are there

1280
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,040
um later i will i will i will show you

1281
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,240
this one that this one is for variables

1282
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,399
so in the next topic we will check this

1283
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,839
so until now what we did is that uh

1284
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,960
we use the background we draw a line we

1285
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,400
draw a

1286
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,240
square and we draw a circle

1287
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,280
and we change the colors and

1288
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,079
the the color of the line the border of

1289
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,640
the shapes

1290
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:15,839
and

1291
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,680
now i i i i would like to

1292
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,520
show you like uh how um

1293
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,680
you can make more interactive these

1294
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,359
these things that you are drawing

1295
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,839
okay because until now everything is

1296
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,359
dead

1297
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,400
so um

1298
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,520
now we will we will make only a few

1299
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,240
one very small experiment we will draw a

1300
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,760
line

1301
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,280
okay let's say that we will draw the

1302
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,920
line from the corner of the

1303
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:57,839
of the screen so the position zero

1304
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:01,440
uh line the position

1305
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:10,559
zero oh what is going on here

1306
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,319
it's not letting me write let me close

1307
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:24,720
i will open it again

1308
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,799
so let's draw a line here zero

1309
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:32,799
and here zero okay so it will start from

1310
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,000
the corner

1311
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,760
the left top corner of the screen

1312
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,720
but now we will not put here a

1313
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,079
static number we will use a system

1314
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:46,880
variable

1315
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,319
in this case we will ask the position

1316
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:53,920
in the x and the y axis

1317
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,119
of your mouse so uh we will

1318
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,359
click here in the button that says d vr

1319
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:05,599
and then it will show you all the system

1320
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,640
variables uh

1321
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,720
which we want to use right now is this

1322
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,039
one that says mousex

1323
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:16,720
mousex and i will choose here also

1324
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,240
mouse mouse y

1325
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,440
and i will say apply so what i am saying

1326
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,799
is we will draw a line

1327
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:27,760
from the position zero zero until the

1328
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,839
position where is the mouse

1329
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:33,039
okay the position x and y of the mouse

1330
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,240
if i run this code

1331
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,720
then uh you will see that is giving this

1332
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,359
beautiful

1333
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,119
like a result is because uh we are not

1334
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,640
uh cleaning the background and

1335
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,880
we can see every line that is getting

1336
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,839
draw every time i am moving the mouse

1337
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:03,839
yes so now the code

1338
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,720
start to be more interactive and it's

1339
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,359
only

1340
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,559
one line of code okay

1341
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,160
uh maybe i don't want that the lines be

1342
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,880
black so what i can do is before this

1343
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,839
line

1344
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:22,180
i will select a color maybe

1345
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,760
[Music]

1346
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,440
line color i will choose blue

1347
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,720
blue select

1348
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,920
so before draw the line it will be blue

1349
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,440
i will run again the code

1350
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,839
so now you will have

1351
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:45,200
like a different result there is also a

1352
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:45,599
way

1353
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:49,520
that we can make that the color be uh

1354
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,839
random and in that way you will have

1355
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:52,960
like a

1356
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,720
different lights with different colors

1357
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,039
this will be like more advanced

1358
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,880
we can try to do it later

1359
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,880
so now what i want to show you is

1360
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,160
how to create variables

1361
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,400
and with these variables we will make

1362
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,520
our own

1363
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,119
first animation okay so

1364
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,839
um let's create let's create a new

1365
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:27,240
project

1366
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:30,640
animation new

1367
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:35,280
okay so

1368
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,559
what we will do is create a

1369
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:42,160
we will reserve in the memory as space

1370
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,359
and in that space we will putting like a

1371
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,000
values that will be able to change

1372
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,079
uh on the time that you are running the

1373
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:51,039
program

1374
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,079
so for create a variable you you come

1375
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:55,440
here to the plus

1376
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,920
button that is beside this icon with a v

1377
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,039
that is for variables so if i press the

1378
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:04,079
plus button

1379
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,079
it will ask me the name of the variable

1380
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,240
that the

1381
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,680
that we want to create so i will create

1382
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,960
um i don't know

1383
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,160
x because i know y

1384
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,359
i will start with y apply so

1385
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:24,640
uh if i want to if i if we want to see

1386
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,440
um if it's created i can come here

1387
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,960
to the v icon variables and now you can

1388
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:33,599
see that is

1389
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,960
the y the variable i created this one

1390
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:37,920
here

1391
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,039
you you you are

1392
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:43,839
like uh they are always there okay and

1393
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,440
they are great because they are

1394
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,319
like always there when you are running

1395
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,520
meta processing

1396
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,240
but these ones that they appear in in

1397
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,200
white color

1398
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,599
is the variables that you create by your

1399
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:56,559
own okay so

1400
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,640
there is a y variable that i just

1401
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,240
created

1402
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:05,119
um if you if you wanted

1403
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:07,520
this is this this variable start with

1404
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,160
the

1405
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,000
specific number uh you can choose that

1406
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,440
to click and then say with which value

1407
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,559
it will start by default

1408
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,760
every variable it will start with 0

1409
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,799
but let's say 10 so i will start that

1410
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:26,319
variable in 10

1411
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,440
i will say apply okay but nothing is

1412
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,359
happening even if i run this code

1413
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:34,319
nothing is happening because i just

1414
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:35,599
create a variable it's

1415
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:39,039
it's not in there okay

1416
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,399
what i will do is i will draw a

1417
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:47,839
rectangle

1418
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,240
and i will say that this rectangle will

1419
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,480
be in the position

1420
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,720
uh

1421
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,680
50 in x but in y

1422
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,400
i will instead of place a number here i

1423
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,160
will choose that variable so i will

1424
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,119
choose

1425
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,960
uh y okay uh here is a mistake

1426
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,240
and uh the size of the

1427
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,160
of the square i don't know it will be

1428
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,640
100 pixels by 100 pixels

1429
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:21,359
okay so if i run this code this code

1430
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:24,799
you can see that now the the the value

1431
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,359
in the

1432
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:28,720
y access

1433
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:33,200
it's a variable so i will run the code

1434
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,480
and it will not moving but it will be in

1435
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,799
the 10 position if i change the value of

1436
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,319
this variable

1437
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:44,000
i will change instead of 10 i will say

1438
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,720
500

1439
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,799
apply i will run the code then you will

1440
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:51,920
be able to see

1441
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,039
that the the square

1442
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,559
is moving according the that number that

1443
01:07:58,559 --> 01:07:58,960
i

1444
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,160
assigned to to that variable but the

1445
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,480
magic will happen here

1446
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,760
if i add i make a mathematical

1447
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,799
operation i will add a new a new line

1448
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:13,839
and for first time we will use the math

1449
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:17,120
and what i will do is i will add a value

1450
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,560
to that variable

1451
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,359
so i will come here to the mathematics i

1452
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,839
will choose the option

1453
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:27,520
the variable is y and i will say

1454
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,560
that whatever is in that in that

1455
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,960
variable add one

1456
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,279
and i will say apply if you run this

1457
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,000
code

1458
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,359
every time this code is repeating and

1459
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,359
repeating and repeating

1460
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:47,600
uh it will be around 60

1461
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:53,359
60 60 times per second

1462
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:57,839
so if we run this code

1463
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:05,198
you will be able to see that is moving

1464
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:06,799
pixel by pixel because

1465
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:10,319
we are changing the position of uh the

1466
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,080
square because the variable

1467
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,920
is uh every cycle increasing in one

1468
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,040
if i wanted the the the movement

1469
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,399
of the rectangle be faster i can change

1470
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:23,279
this one

1471
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,920
for for a bigger number so let's try

1472
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,279
with two

1473
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,158
apply so then the the square will move

1474
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:32,719
faster

1475
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:36,479
okay uh

1476
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:38,719
also also maybe i want that it will

1477
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:39,679
start from

1478
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:42,158
from the top so what i can do is change

1479
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:42,799
the

1480
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:46,479
initial value of the variable so uh

1481
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:51,439
instead of 500 i will choose zero

1482
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,560
and then i will run this code so it will

1483
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,480
start to appear from zero

1484
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,520
i will increase then the numbers but if

1485
01:09:59,520 --> 01:09:59,920
if

1486
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,600
if you can see the problem is that uh

1487
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,520
you are having this like a shadow

1488
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,560
that is led leaving the the square

1489
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,760
because you are not

1490
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,800
uh removing like cleaning the screen so

1491
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,960
something that that we can do here

1492
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,440
in this point to make it more similar to

1493
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,640
an animation

1494
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,480
is to before before to draw the

1495
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,080
the rectangle erase all the screen so

1496
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,360
we will add that

1497
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,719
instruction here of background

1498
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:39,040
and let's say that the background is

1499
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:43,280
green yes select

1500
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,880
i will run so then

1501
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,120
it will not leave that this uh

1502
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,719
shadow behind it's only moving

1503
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,560
okay so uh i would like

1504
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,280
i would like to to give you a few times

1505
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,760
if you want to do the experiment and

1506
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,440
please let me know if it's working this

1507
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,679
uh as i told you this is a very

1508
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:11,280
experimental

1509
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,920
software still there are a lot of bugs

1510
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,360
that we need to

1511
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,839
to fix

1512
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,760
i hope i hope be able to

1513
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,880
to check which is happening in mac

1514
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,960
i don't have a mac computer so for me

1515
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,080
sometimes it's

1516
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,840
quite hard to make the experiments

1517
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,360
so i don't know if you already

1518
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:39,440
are able to to draw things in your

1519
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,239
screen

1520
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:44,159
and if um

1521
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,600
i i make myself

1522
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,880
clear about the steps that you have to

1523
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,640
follow to create this animation

1524
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,679
feel free to ask

1525
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,800
i don't know if you are ready i i

1526
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,719
i can keep the topic

1527
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,760
okay no questions uh

1528
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:16,640
the next the next topic uh

1529
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,159
was okay we already saw the variables

1530
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:23,360
and the animation now let's see the next

1531
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,960
topic that is inputs

1532
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,239
okay so the idea is to because

1533
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:30,400
because these these programs we are

1534
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,679
making here

1535
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,719
uh we are like uh

1536
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:36,800
like i just watching something happen

1537
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,320
there but it is

1538
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,679
to interact so uh i will

1539
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,239
show you how to interact with your mouse

1540
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,480
and your keyword

1541
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,839
so let's create let's create a new

1542
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,040
let's create

1543
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,679
a new project

1544
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:06,000
and this will be mouse

1545
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,040
mouse new

1546
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:13,040
apply so uh

1547
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,760
until now we have been using only code

1548
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,239
here

1549
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:19,679
in the in the principal tab

1550
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:23,440
now uh we we should press in the mouse

1551
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,960
tab you can see that whenever you press

1552
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,840
the tab change the color of the

1553
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,520
background

1554
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,719
so the idea is that

1555
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,920
all the codes that we will add here will

1556
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:40,800
run

1557
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,400
at the moment at any mouse button

1558
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,719
doesn't matter if is the left the right

1559
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,320
of the center

1560
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,199
any mouse button you press it it will

1561
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,360
execute the code that will be in this

1562
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,400
tab

1563
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,719
so let's say that whenever we press the

1564
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:58,880
mouse we will change the background

1565
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,800
to red okay so

1566
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,800
i just yes andrew

1567
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,800
oh no i can see now what that is that

1568
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,199
the the mouse and keyboard tabs are the

1569
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:12,320
um

1570
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,360
uh the callbacks

1571
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:19,679
or for mouse and keyboard yes in in

1572
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,679
in processing you have to make

1573
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:28,480
functions to create the code so

1574
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,520
you have this tab you have the draw

1575
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,600
and you have the mouse press it and key

1576
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,880
press it okay

1577
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,360
and you have to use brackets to open and

1578
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,880
close

1579
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,040
so with meta processing you avoid to

1580
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,480
create these functions because by

1581
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,239
default they are already created

1582
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:47,280
you just have to add code inside so

1583
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,719
it's also making you faster to develop

1584
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,719
the code because you just forget these

1585
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,040
small details and just start to add the

1586
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,159
lines

1587
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59,040
so yes actually it's it's an abstraction

1588
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,320
of these functions

1589
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:04,640
this callbacks to these functions uh

1590
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,480
that interrupt the execution of the code

1591
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,719
if you press the mouse of you if you

1592
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,080
press the keyboard

1593
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,199
yes it's like that so

1594
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,890
uh right now we are just

1595
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:20,239
[Music]

1596
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:23,679
using any any any button okay if i

1597
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,880
execute this code uh

1598
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,920
then the window will open and if i press

1599
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,280
any button can be the right the left

1600
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,559
the center it will get

1601
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,400
red okay uh the problem is that once

1602
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,760
it's red it will stay red so uh

1603
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,960
let's let's use keyword also

1604
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,280
and i will change the the background

1605
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,120
color with the keyword

1606
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,880
so i will say that if i press any key of

1607
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,120
the keyword

1608
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,320
the background will be green

1609
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:03,600
okay so i will select this one

1610
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,040
so mouse if i press mouse will be red

1611
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,280
if i press the keyword it will be green

1612
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,800
okay i will execute this

1613
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:18,400
uh so red green red green i am using my

1614
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,040
keyword and my

1615
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,440
and my mouse okay so now

1616
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,280
uh it's more interactive the code okay

1617
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,600
uh it still is not so advanced but at

1618
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,640
least i

1619
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,640
know that my mouse is working and my

1620
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,159
keyword is working

1621
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:39,679
okay uh

1622
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:43,280
the the there is another topic

1623
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,679
that we need to talk about this is the

1624
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:47,199
topic eight

1625
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:50,640
that is the conditionals okay because

1626
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,400
if we want to know if we are pressing a

1627
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,280
special key in the keyword or a special

1628
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,080
mouse

1629
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,520
then we need to use this

1630
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,080
uh structure that they are conditionals

1631
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,840
okay so to create a condition

1632
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,440
in conditionals in

1633
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,280
in metaprocessing you have to add

1634
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,719
a new line and in these

1635
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,560
categories you will have this one that

1636
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,520
is there are the structures

1637
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,040
so you can add if a structure or

1638
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:32,719
uh for structure in this case for the

1639
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:33,600
conditions

1640
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,600
you need to add if structure okay

1641
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,120
and you will have this window the idea

1642
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:44,239
in the condition is that you have one

1643
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,400
value that you are comparing with other

1644
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,040
value

1645
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,159
okay so what we will do right now is

1646
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,880
that we will compare

1647
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,239
in this case the last button that i

1648
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:57,600
press in the mouse

1649
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,719
so we will check here this variable we

1650
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:01,840
will click here

1651
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,080
and you have a a variable called click

1652
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,040
this variable is always recording which

1653
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,440
was the last button that you press

1654
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,880
okay so i choose that one so i will say

1655
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,000
that

1656
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,199
if click is equal

1657
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:22,400
and then i have this character this uh

1658
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,360
sorry this icon that is with a c that is

1659
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,640
character

1660
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,760
so i will click here and any character

1661
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,920
that i press from the keyword let's say

1662
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,600
a ah sorry sorry sorry we are with mouse

1663
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:36,800
this is later this is the next

1664
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,920
explanation

1665
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,040
uh now we will use the mouse so as we

1666
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,640
will use the mouse

1667
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,080
we have this icon that is the mouse so

1668
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,960
if i click here with the left with the

1669
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:49,679
center

1670
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,960
or the right button it will appear a

1671
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,239
number here so

1672
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:58,000
if i press left it will be 37 if i press

1673
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,880
center it will be three and if i press

1674
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,400
right it will be 39

1675
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:06,560
39 so that is the value of

1676
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,320
each button if it's press okay so

1677
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,040
let's say that i want to use the left

1678
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,800
button so 37

1679
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,400
so whenever i click and the click is 37

1680
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,080
so this will be my condition okay

1681
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,280
so uh 37 is not

1682
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,920
giving me any any information is nothing

1683
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,600
for me but whenever you

1684
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,600
you add the line you will have this

1685
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,199
information is saying left

1686
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:36,159
so you know that this click is to check

1687
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:36,719
if

1688
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:39,440
the left button of the mouse was pressed

1689
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,640
okay

1690
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,600
now uh when you are using the if

1691
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,760
structure it will change a little bit

1692
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,000
how to add a new instruction because

1693
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,840
when you move the mouse then there will

1694
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,360
be not this green

1695
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,719
uh button it will be this uh

1696
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,120
diamond blue diamond with them plus

1697
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,400
inside

1698
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,800
this is because you will make a new line

1699
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,480
inside that

1700
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:07,040
if structure uh

1701
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,080
so i will i will make click here

1702
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,920
and this line is inside that

1703
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,280
structure that is the if so

1704
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,760
in this case the line three will execute

1705
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,520
only in the case that this

1706
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,800
line two is is true if the click is is

1707
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,159
is left then it will execute this so

1708
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:31,840
uh i will put here the um background

1709
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:36,480
red so if i press left

1710
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,360
it will be red i will delete this one

1711
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,120
here

1712
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,800
so if i press if i click left

1713
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,000
the ground will be uh red

1714
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,480
uh if i want to make more things i will

1715
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,000
press in the blue

1716
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,239
diamond but no i want like a new line

1717
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:59,600
outside the if so i will keep moving the

1718
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,760
the mouse no i don't want to delete i

1719
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,360
keep moving the mouse to the right and

1720
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,040
then the green

1721
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,920
button appears so i will click here and

1722
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,080
now this instruction is outside the

1723
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:13,840
the if now we'll make another if

1724
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,960
and i will select again the

1725
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,199
click if the click is with the

1726
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:24,400
left i will apply

1727
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,440
and then i will say that the background

1728
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,000
is green

1729
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,719
perfect so in this code

1730
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:40,159
uh whenever i press the button of the

1731
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,080
mouse it will execute this

1732
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,600
and he will check if i press

1733
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,880
left background will be red

1734
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,600
if i press

1735
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:55,120
right the background will be green so i

1736
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,280
will execute

1737
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,880
and i hope it will work red

1738
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,000
green red green yes is work

1739
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,280
okay so uh

1740
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,360
now we learn something else and it's how

1741
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,800
to use conditions

1742
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,920
in this way we are

1743
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,960
checking if the click

1744
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,400
that i did in the mouse what was left or

1745
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,120
right

1746
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,239
the same can happen with the keyword

1747
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:27,840
so instead of i will delete this

1748
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,000
instead of that any key of the keyword

1749
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,159
change the background i will i will say

1750
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,400
that i need that you press

1751
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,920
a specific letter so we will use if

1752
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:40,719
again

1753
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:44,560
if but instead of

1754
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,159
click we will use the variable key

1755
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:52,000
that is the last key that you press uh

1756
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,199
it will be equal to the character that i

1757
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:57,120
will choose so that i have to press here

1758
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,080
in the c

1759
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,440
see and press any uh

1760
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:06,000
character in my keyword i will say a so

1761
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,159
uh i will say apply so if i press the

1762
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,040
key

1763
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:14,159
a what i will do and then i will add

1764
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:15,440
here

1765
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,159
background and let's say that it will be

1766
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,600
like a

1767
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,760
pink okay so now if i press

1768
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,719
the key a background will be pink if the

1769
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:27,440
mouse

1770
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,560
i press left is red

1771
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,000
right is green so three colors now

1772
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,440
let's let's check uh

1773
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,719
so red green and pink

1774
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,760
red green pink pink red

1775
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:49,280
green great so um

1776
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:52,320
so we have seen a lot of things now

1777
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,920
uh how to use the mouse how to use the

1778
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:56,560
keyword

1779
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,679
how to use conditions now uh

1780
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:04,719
the next topic it's

1781
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,239
how to use multimedia instructions

1782
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:13,679
so in the multimedia instructions that

1783
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:14,639
we have here

1784
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:19,600
in in processing the meta processing

1785
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:26,880
i will create a new project so

1786
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,719
let's play first a

1787
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:35,440
note let's play notes

1788
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:39,280
okay so i will create this project and

1789
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,280
what i will do is that if i press the

1790
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,880
bounce i would like to hear

1791
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,400
something so i will remove my my

1792
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,800
my my microphone and that way you will

1793
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,560
be able to

1794
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,560
to hear so i will come here to the

1795
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,880
mouse tab and

1796
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,400
i will add an instruction of multimedia

1797
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,760
and you have three

1798
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,320
one is to play a note another is to play

1799
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,040
a sound

1800
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,840
and another is to play a video the sound

1801
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,679
can be

1802
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:15,120
waff file or mp3 file

1803
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,239
the play note is like if you are playing

1804
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:20,560
a keyword

1805
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,320
so uh i will choose this one play note

1806
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,480
and you will have this window in this

1807
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,920
window you can

1808
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,120
select the node and the octave

1809
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:35,760
of the node so uh

1810
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,800
i can choose c eight

1811
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,080
for instance apply so

1812
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,440
in this case any moment i press

1813
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,000
any button of the mouse it will execute

1814
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,560
that that line that display that note

1815
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,000
okay so i hope you can hear

1816
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,800
i will check if i have enough

1817
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,400
anyway let's play

1818
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,080
so it's open nothing is happening i will

1819
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,880
press my mouse

1820
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,840
i don't know if you are able to hear

1821
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,960
okay great

1822
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,360
if i if i try to do this in processing

1823
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,199
it will take a lot of code

1824
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:20,080
andrew as it see it's a pretty high

1825
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:20,639
pitch

1826
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:24,080
like it i will change it i will change

1827
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,520
it

1828
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,600
so i will come here

1829
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,560
you click here and i will make more

1830
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,760
beautiful like a

1831
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,199
less high pitch so i will choose

1832
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:40,480
b okay

1833
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,920
so and more like like here like that

1834
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,239
really

1835
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:50,080
only four more yes so let's try again

1836
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,719
let's play

1837
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,360
and let's go

1838
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:01,120
it's not giving me an office strong i

1839
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,360
think it's because it's really down so

1840
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,320
i will i will put at least one to be

1841
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,400
able to hear

1842
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,559
but

1843
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,719
yes it's really down it's really down

1844
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:19,199
even for me it's really hard to hear

1845
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:22,000
so i will i feel i will increase a

1846
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,760
little bit more

1847
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,520
is it just playing a sine wave yes

1848
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,120
uh okay then yeah if there's no

1849
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,880
overtones we wouldn't it's

1850
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:38,000
my laptop speakers are tiny anyways yes

1851
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,560
but uh

1852
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:47,840
let's play this other one

1853
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,800
it's playing really down anyway here

1854
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,960
here in meta processing you can you can

1855
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,000
check

1856
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,880
a very beautiful example that is this

1857
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:01,679
one called

1858
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:05,440
piano colors note and

1859
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,320
in this one is more advanced code of

1860
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,199
course

1861
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:13,520
and you can you can use your keyword

1862
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:17,120
with the letters as the f g

1863
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:21,520
h j and every time you press these

1864
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,760
letters you will have a different

1865
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,040
background color

1866
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:29,120
and a different note will play

1867
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,159
and it will give you a text in the in

1868
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:32,960
the screen

1869
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,239
telling you which note you play so

1870
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:43,839
let's check if this one works better

1871
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:46,400
[Music]

1872
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,400
yes

1873
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,320
[Music]

1874
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:54,239
i hope you can hear this one yes

1875
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,760
uh so um

1876
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,239
if you want if you want to to to play

1877
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:01,280
with this

1878
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,639
this kind of uh notes in in processing

1879
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:07,760
it will take more more code

1880
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,600
this one is like an abstraction of

1881
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,800
many lines of coding yes uh

1882
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,880
of course in processing you will be able

1883
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,280
to to change parameters like the

1884
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,960
duration of the node

1885
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,400
like the pitch a lot of things but

1886
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,880
sometimes you just want to play notes

1887
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,280
like a small keyword so this is

1888
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:33,360
good only to like a prototype

1889
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,960
uh the next uh option that you can use

1890
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,080
is

1891
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:41,280
to play a uh mp3 or

1892
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:45,600
wav file so there is also a good example

1893
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,400
here

1894
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:50,840
uh in the in the projects

1895
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,000
folder uh this one is

1896
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,760
uh sony raton

1897
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,920
is this one so uh

1898
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:05,120
in this one you just have to add

1899
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:10,080
one line is very very easy is

1900
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,000
i will i will do it from the beginning

1901
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,679
if you have a new project

1902
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:17,199
you just choose the mouse

1903
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:20,719
tab and add

1904
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:24,159
the instruction sound

1905
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,960
it will appear one window only with one

1906
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,560
parameter that is the

1907
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,400
file that you want to play so if you do

1908
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:35,600
click in select then

1909
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,159
it will open the data folder so it

1910
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:39,280
requires that you

1911
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,600
in the data folder have the the file

1912
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,639
before

1913
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,159
i will choose this web file

1914
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:49,600
open so i say apply

1915
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,760
so that is destruction i just want that

1916
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:52,960
you play this

1917
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:56,480
mellow web file if i press any button of

1918
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,199
the mouse

1919
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:02,320
okay so i do click here

1920
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:05,520
and if i press my mouse

1921
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,360
that sounds loud okay

1922
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,639
so uh notes sound

1923
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,400
even the sound in processing also

1924
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,719
require a lot of lines this one is one

1925
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:18,080
line and you can

1926
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:23,440
uh play a wave of mp3 file

1927
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,920
and the last one is video so we can we

1928
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,440
can try opening the

1929
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:32,639
example of video

1930
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:35,760
that is this one video test and video

1931
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,840
test

1932
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,520
you you you can have background or not

1933
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,880
and the instruction video

1934
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,480
required three parameters the file that

1935
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,760
in this case is this dom wmv

1936
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:55,760
file and the position where you want to

1937
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,040
play the video in this case i am using

1938
01:31:59,040 --> 01:31:59,520
the

1939
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,400
position of my mouse in x and the

1940
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:03,120
position

1941
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,480
in y of my mouse

1942
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:10,080
so um i will

1943
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:14,400
i will execute this this code

1944
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:25,040
and if i move my mouse the the video is

1945
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,600
playing following the

1946
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,000
but if i don't want that the video is

1947
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,120
moving around

1948
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,199
i just want that the video in a fixed

1949
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:35,040
position i just change

1950
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,400
here uh i don't know

1951
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:43,679
50 50 50 50

1952
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:47,360
value apply

1953
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,880
and then is not moving

1954
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:54,480
okay uh something

1955
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,679
something that is a good experiment

1956
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:00,800
uh with this uh

1957
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,639
this project i will open it again to

1958
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:07,360
uh is that don't don't remove the

1959
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,600
background don't clean the background

1960
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,719
just play the video without

1961
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:14,400
removing the background and then you

1962
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:18,320
will have this beautiful effect

1963
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:22,320
that is that is leaving like

1964
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:26,000
the background the last frame of the

1965
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,400
video

1966
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,960
so uh the same in processing to play a

1967
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,719
video it will require

1968
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:37,840
more lines of code this is like making

1969
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,719
simple the process

1970
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:43,199
okay we are almost we are almost done

1971
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:44,880
with the topics

1972
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,159
uh this the next two topics

1973
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:51,199
are those who take more time so i hope

1974
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:51,920
time will

1975
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,520
give will be enough uh

1976
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,920
in the next topics the idea is to

1977
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:00,000
[Music]

1978
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,120
check how to use arduino with

1979
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,760
a meta processing and meta javascript

1980
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:06,719
okay

1981
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:09,920
so uh in this case i have here my my

1982
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,960
arduino

1983
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:14,239
okay uh

1984
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,520
so i just want to say a few things

1985
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,600
before

1986
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:23,600
uh there is that you have your board

1987
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,239
uh the board you will plug the board by

1988
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:27,520
by usb

1989
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:31,440
uh wire and there are

1990
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,840
there is one step that you need to do

1991
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:34,800
first

1992
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,440
in in order to to use arduino with meta

1993
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:38,239
processing

1994
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,400
and is that you will need to download

1995
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,360
the uh

1996
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:44,000
arduino

1997
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:49,119
the arduino ide environment

1998
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:52,719
and uh loading the word

1999
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:56,080
the firmata library

2000
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:00,560
the the standard example

2001
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,119
and this will be like the first step

2002
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:03,679
like uh

2003
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:06,639
the the requirement to to to use you

2004
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:07,040
just

2005
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,360
do it one time and then you just leave

2006
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,960
with that and

2007
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:15,600
no no more steps additional steps

2008
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,639
uh there is one one

2009
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:21,199
one thing if you are using meta

2010
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:22,719
javascript

2011
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:27,199
to play with the arduino is that

2012
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:30,560
in order to don't use uh

2013
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,320
node.js and johnny5

2014
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,600
to establish this uh

2015
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:40,000
communication between javascript and the

2016
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:40,880
and the

2017
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:44,560
arduino uh

2018
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,159
you just have to keep open meta

2019
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:47,600
processing

2020
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,520
and meta processing will be the host

2021
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,119
in that way you don't need to style

2022
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:54,719
node.js or

2023
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:58,400
johnny5 only keep open uh the

2024
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,679
meta processing in the javascript uh

2025
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:03,840
whenever you play then the browser will

2026
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,040
open but

2027
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,880
keep in the background meta processing

2028
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,719
if you close meta processing

2029
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:11,119
sorry meta javascript then the program

2030
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:12,480
will fail because

2031
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,679
uh meta javascript will be like the

2032
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:16,400
bridge

2033
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,760
between your app in in in the browser

2034
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:23,520
and your arduino okay

2035
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,330
so uh

2036
01:36:24,330 --> 01:36:26,880
[Music]

2037
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,840
the instructions that uh you can use

2038
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,040
with

2039
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,159
with their meta javascript meta

2040
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:35,040
processing

2041
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:38,480
is you can make digital

2042
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,920
output digital input analog

2043
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:45,119
input and control servo that is what you

2044
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:45,920
can do

2045
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:50,239
until now uh

2046
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:54,080
so in order to use uh

2047
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,800
arduino with metaprocessing i suggest

2048
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,480
that you check the page

2049
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:04,638
69 of the book i i have the book here

2050
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:08,719
so um

2051
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:11,040
i want to show you something here in the

2052
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,280
book

2053
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:24,880
so in the meta processing book

2054
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:29,600
on the page 69 69

2055
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,840
page 69 yes

2056
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:36,000
uh in the page 69 is where you will find

2057
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
the explanation of how to

2058
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,199
use uh your arduino uh

2059
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:44,719
so uh here is like the step by step

2060
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:48,080
how to install the firmata library

2061
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:51,679
in your arduino board like at the the

2062
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:55,840
every step in arduino uh ah

2063
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,800
i can do it here i will plug now my

2064
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,840
arduino

2065
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:05,440
here i will open my arduino

2066
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,800
id it's just that

2067
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,560
i want to let you know that everything

2068
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,000
is in the book

2069
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,280
so maybe later you want to do it

2070
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,880
okay so the first step

2071
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,080
is that you have to come to tools okay

2072
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:26,719
and be sure that your your board is the

2073
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:28,560
right board

2074
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,760
i am using here an arduino uno

2075
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,320
so i have to choose arduino uno here in

2076
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,960
my board

2077
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,360
um

2078
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:43,920
i have to select the port in this case

2079
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,800
is this one the

2080
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:52,159
tty acm 0

2081
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,600
so those are the the two steps that

2082
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,040
uh you have to be sure before select the

2083
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:02,400
board select the port

2084
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:05,520
and then you can you have to come here

2085
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,000
to the examples

2086
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
and check the firmata

2087
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,480
a if you don't have formatted you you

2088
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,840
will need to start

2089
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,119
the firmata a library

2090
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:23,600
to install the firmata library you can

2091
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:24,550
come here to

2092
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:27,739
[Music]

2093
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:31,280
include library in this option in

2094
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,840
the sketch include library manage

2095
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,800
libraries and then you will type

2096
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,800
a firmata if if you don't have it

2097
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,760
as i was checking it's included already

2098
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:44,239
in the

2099
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:47,119
in the distributions of arduino but

2100
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:49,280
maybe you have an old version whatever i

2101
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:50,080
am just

2102
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:53,760
if you're required to install it again

2103
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:54,239
so

2104
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:57,360
here you can install just type for mata

2105
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,920
and then you will get here the firmata

2106
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,040
and you just press

2107
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:04,159
install or if you want to have a

2108
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:07,360
updated version so you can update here

2109
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:10,880
anyway i i already have my firmata

2110
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,159
library so i just come here to the

2111
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:15,199
examples

2112
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:18,080
i go to the examples of the firmata and

2113
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:18,719
select

2114
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:22,400
standard firmata okay

2115
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,840
so uh this is the standard formatter i

2116
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,880
will upload the code to my

2117
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:32,800
my arduino is loading

2118
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,080
okay done uploading so now

2119
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:39,440
it has the fill mata okay great so

2120
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:42,320
now i can close the arduino this is a

2121
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,880
important step

2122
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,360
be sure that before use meta processing

2123
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,960
or meta javascript

2124
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:52,639
you are sure that you close meta pro

2125
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:56,480
arduino because if you left arduino open

2126
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,000
it will make uh like um problems and

2127
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,679
will not let you make

2128
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:05,199
the the communication okay so now that

2129
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:08,239
my arduino is closed i will

2130
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:13,519
i will come to my um

2131
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,840
my meta processing i will make a new

2132
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,840
project my new project will be

2133
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,280
i don't know our arduino

2134
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:27,759
arduino test apply

2135
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:31,760
so uh all the arduino boards have

2136
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,000
one led including the board that is

2137
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
connected to the 13

2138
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,590
terminal of the of the arduino so

2139
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:45,199
[Music]

2140
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:47,440
what i will do is that whenever i press

2141
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,280
any button of the mouse i will

2142
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:52,880
turn on that led so i will show you

2143
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,080
right now that lid is off is

2144
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:58,400
it's just right here it's off only this

2145
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,199
one is on

2146
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:02,639
but this one is off okay so

2147
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:06,639
you just have to add the line of arduino

2148
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:08,639
here sometimes you can get confused

2149
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:10,159
because both

2150
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:13,440
uh are with the same name but those

2151
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:17,040
that say iot controller app it's for

2152
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:20,639
this are for the esp uh

2153
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:22,960
so be sure that you are using the

2154
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,639
arduino instructions

2155
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:28,239
so i will select the digital output

2156
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:31,520
instruction and in the window

2157
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:35,679
appear the 13 terminals of the arduino

2158
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:37,760
and i just have to make click in the in

2159
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:38,880
the in the

2160
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,560
terminal i want to use in this case the

2161
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,639
13 that

2162
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:45,840
the leds is in that terminal

2163
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,719
a one means that it's on if i click

2164
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:50,560
again it will be zero between

2165
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:54,080
off on off on off so

2166
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:57,199
i i want to put on the

2167
01:42:57,199 --> 01:43:00,400
the terminal 13 apply

2168
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,600
so here with any mouse button i press

2169
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,800
this lib will get on okay

2170
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,920
so i hope it will work you will see but

2171
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:11,760
i will be not able to see maybe

2172
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,440
but anyway i hope i will see also so i

2173
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:18,239
will run the code

2174
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:20,480
uh still i am not making click i will

2175
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,400
wait that it loads okay

2176
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,080
now it's not blinking so it means that

2177
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:27,199
it's ready and i will press my mouse

2178
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:30,000
and now the led is on okay the problem

2179
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,600
is that it will keep on

2180
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:35,360
okay so uh i have to be sure that i will

2181
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:35,760
turn

2182
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,440
off so with the mouse

2183
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:42,960
i will turn on and

2184
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:46,080
i will copy this line control c

2185
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:50,239
i come to keyword control ue

2186
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:53,840
and instead of one i would say zero

2187
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,960
apply so with the mouse i will

2188
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,320
make on the the led with the keyword i

2189
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:01,360
will

2190
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,639
turn off okay so

2191
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:08,000
uh i will reset my arduino i will

2192
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,080
run the code i will show you

2193
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:18,840
okay is ready so uh

2194
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:21,760
mouse keyword

2195
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,040
mouse keyword mouse

2196
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:29,679
keyword okay so uh

2197
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,840
in the same way we'll work the other

2198
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:34,080
instructions

2199
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:37,280
so let's move the servo okay

2200
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:40,320
i i have to this arduino

2201
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:43,600
uh plug this servo okay so there is the

2202
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:46,080
servo

2203
01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:50,000
this servo is connected

2204
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,119
to the terminal 7

2205
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:56,159
in the arduino okay i i don't know if

2206
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:57,119
you can see but

2207
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:59,260
anyway terminal 7

2208
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:00,400
[Music]

2209
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:03,760
it's the the servo motor

2210
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:08,080
so uh i will i will use this code

2211
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:12,800
so i will add instruction of servo

2212
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:15,760
so we already know that the servo is in

2213
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,920
the seven so i will select the

2214
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:21,119
the seven uh

2215
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:24,400
terminal and the angle

2216
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,800
where i want that it moves so i will say

2217
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,960
that with this one it will be zero

2218
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:32,400
angle and in the keyword

2219
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:36,880
the servo in the pin 7

2220
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:40,639
it will be 180

2221
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:42,560
so i will move from one side to the

2222
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,760
other side

2223
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:47,040
the server so let's check if it's

2224
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:47,840
working

2225
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,719
let's check if

2226
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:54,800
i hope so

2227
01:45:54,800 --> 01:46:00,159
let's play i will execute the code

2228
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:04,000
and mouse

2229
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:08,639
okay it moves a little bit now

2230
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:11,679
keyword mouse

2231
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:14,960
keyword mouse and you can see that the

2232
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,199
led is also turning on and off

2233
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:21,170
yes so

2234
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:23,440
[Music]

2235
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,840
if you try to do this kind of things

2236
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:26,639
with uh

2237
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:28,800
with processing you can you can use

2238
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,159
processing to

2239
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:32,159
to interact with arduino using the

2240
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:33,520
fermata

2241
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,760
but you will require also more

2242
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:36,639
instructions

2243
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:39,920
so this one really simplify the process

2244
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,280
and

2245
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,199
and maybe not for you that you speak

2246
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:44,800
english but

2247
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,639
for people like me that our main

2248
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:48,239
language is not english it's very nice

2249
01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:50,080
when you can code in your in your own

2250
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:51,119
language

2251
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:54,719
so arduino processing and almost

2252
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:57,520
99 percent of the programming languages

2253
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:58,800
are in english

2254
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,679
so it's nice to have a tool that let you

2255
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:03,600
code

2256
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,080
in your own language so this is giving

2257
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:06,639
you

2258
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:10,159
like a lot of creative opportunities to

2259
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:13,679
interact with the hardware with

2260
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:17,920
the web browser uh like using only one

2261
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:22,159
one environment that in this case uh

2262
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:23,920
yes are the meta processing and meta

2263
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:26,239
javascript are two different software

2264
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:27,760
but the instructions the set of

2265
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:30,800
instructions are the same

2266
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:33,840
uh so

2267
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,840
uh here we can

2268
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:41,199
check the last topic

2269
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:45,040
that is how to use uh the esp

2270
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,840
board with meta processing and meta

2271
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,239
javascript

2272
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:53,199
unfortunately i will be not able to make

2273
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:54,880
the demonstration

2274
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:57,600
and i will explain you why so uh that's

2275
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:58,000
why

2276
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,280
i need to show you this

2277
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:07,679
image and and explain you how it works

2278
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:11,679
uh the idea the idea with the isp

2279
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:14,960
esp board is that uh you will be

2280
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,199
connected to internet okay

2281
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:20,559
but until now

2282
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:24,560
because because i am facing problems to

2283
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,679
make the

2284
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:28,960
uh like my computer

2285
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:32,960
go to a external ip i i don't know how

2286
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:36,480
still to do that because my router

2287
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:40,159
give me trouble anyway so the the way i

2288
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:43,520
try to face the problem is that i

2289
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:47,600
i i make the esp as uh with the

2290
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:50,320
wi-fi hotspot so it's like a small

2291
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:51,360
router

2292
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,400
so i i load the software here

2293
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:58,480
that is called the iot controller app

2294
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:02,719
that here you can see this is the uh

2295
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:07,119
the url of this software i will

2296
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,519
share

2297
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,840
chat

2298
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:20,800
in this in the chat i shared the the url

2299
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:24,960
uh you can you can download that

2300
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,679
that code this arduino code load the

2301
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:28,080
code

2302
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,239
in the in the world and now the word

2303
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:32,000
will be a hot spot

2304
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,520
okay so whenever you

2305
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,239
give electricity to the isp you will be

2306
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:39,360
able to see this

2307
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,880
as a router so you need to use your

2308
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:43,679
computer

2309
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:46,960
and get connected to there to

2310
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,960
to the isp so it will be a local

2311
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:51,840
connection okay

2312
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,119
so the esp will will be not able to

2313
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:56,800
provide you internet

2314
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,320
but uh it will be uh point-to-point

2315
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:01,760
communication

2316
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,080
okay but at least it will be wireless so

2317
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,840
the point with this kind of experiment

2318
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:10,159
is how to make a control wirelessly

2319
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:13,920
uh using the the esp

2320
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,280
uh by default the uh

2321
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,840
address the ip address it will be this

2322
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:20,760
one

2323
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:25,440
190 268 4.1

2324
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:28,080
so you don't have to worry for that ip

2325
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,119
address the

2326
01:50:29,119 --> 01:50:31,040
meta javascript meta processing by

2327
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,119
default they are

2328
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:36,639
like uh attached to that ip address

2329
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:40,000
so you just have to establish the the

2330
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,520
the link if i try to do this then i will

2331
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:45,360
be without the internet so

2332
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:48,080
i will be not able to show you anyway so

2333
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,040
the idea is that

2334
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:53,199
it will be established the communication

2335
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:56,080
and then you will be not with internet

2336
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,159
but you will be able to use exactly the

2337
01:50:58,159 --> 01:50:59,840
same we were using the instructions with

2338
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,119
arduino

2339
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:04,639
uh over the esp so if you say

2340
01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:09,280
turn on the light the in the terminal

2341
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:12,719
7 so it will be on off

2342
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:14,639
the same with the servo the same with

2343
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:16,159
the

2344
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:20,320
digital input with the analog input

2345
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,239
so the the only situation is that

2346
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:24,719
meanwhile meanwhile because as

2347
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,679
i told you this is uh under construction

2348
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:29,040
project

2349
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:32,840
it's only local point-to-point

2350
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:35,520
communication uh

2351
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:40,560
i don't know if there is any question

2352
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:44,800
i hope i was able to

2353
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,840
make you all understand what

2354
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:51,199
trying to say thank you so much

2355
01:51:51,199 --> 01:51:54,719
i hope you like it and uh this is my

2356
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:57,760
email if you

2357
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:02,080
have questions uh i would like to say to

2358
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:04,960
to clements that will be very nice if

2359
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:05,599
you can

2360
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:08,880
send me by email screenshots of the

2361
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,960
failure of

2362
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:13,199
your installation of metaprocessing and

2363
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:14,320
meta javascript

2364
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,639
that way i can study and check what is

2365
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:17,840
going on

2366
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:20,880
and try to reproduce the the mistake and

2367
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:21,760
try to check

2368
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,040
how to solve the problem and

2369
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:28,840
so that's it i don't know thank you very

2370
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,840
much

2371
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,639
let's see david so it looks like you

2372
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:45,840
have one question in the chat

2373
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,840
hmm

2374
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:03,440
okay the email

2375
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:06,560
is this one uh

2376
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:09,760
i don't have facebook

2377
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:14,320
so you can contact me through this

2378
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,360
email and i hope i hope uh

2379
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:20,080
help you if you are facing problems and

2380
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,280
making work the

2381
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:24,400
software uh

2382
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:28,480
and thank you to be here

2383
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,639
thank you it was i thought it was kind

2384
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:33,920
of very interesting

2385
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:37,840
that the multi language support in meta

2386
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:38,800
processing is

2387
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:41,360
is very very cool but that was not what

2388
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,360
you were demonstrating today

2389
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:46,400
you've no uh just you made it easier to

2390
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:47,679
learn and get started with

2391
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:50,480
programming in general yes you're just

2392
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,119
very

2393
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:54,000
entry for beginners in processing even

2394
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,280
as a native english speaker

2395
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:58,560
so python whatever yes

2396
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,880
but but actually the main concern with

2397
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:03,040
this project is for people

2398
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:06,080
who their native language is not english

2399
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:09,119
and uh uh

2400
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:12,159
coding get like an abstraction

2401
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:14,080
because you are not thinking in your own

2402
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:16,239
language you have to think in others

2403
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:16,880
language

2404
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,320
because all the instructions are in

2405
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,239
english so it's not

2406
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:23,760
so transparent the process of calling

2407
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:27,280
if if you if you or you are native

2408
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:28,159
english so

2409
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:30,639
calling is almost like speaking for us

2410
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:31,920
is not speaking for us

2411
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,400
it's like a making abstraction of all

2412
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,000
the instructions

2413
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,760
so uh if you have a tool that lets you

2414
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,840
write code in the in the language that

2415
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:42,800
you think

2416
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:45,040
and make you easier the the process of

2417
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:47,280
learning coding

2418
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:50,400
i would also imagine even even if you

2419
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:51,199
could

2420
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:53,440
learn the few key words and syntax like

2421
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:55,599
like like if statements for instance

2422
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:56,639
you would still not be able to

2423
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:59,440
understand any of the comments

2424
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:04,080
and so but you can add comments here oh

2425
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:05,520
no i i i i

2426
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,840
understand but if you if you you're

2427
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:09,280
trying if you're trying to read someone

2428
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,639
else's code

2429
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:14,080
yes that's gonna get another

2430
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:15,920
uh but sometimes when you are learning

2431
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,360
code uh

2432
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:20,159
especially the the first days you don't

2433
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:21,199
remember with

2434
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:24,560
which means every parameter so the tool

2435
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:26,800
at least help you remembering oh the

2436
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:27,599
first one is

2437
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:31,280
x the second one is y like so

2438
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:33,840
yes but when the projects get really

2439
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,199
complex

2440
01:55:35,199 --> 01:55:36,800
even if you have that information will

2441
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,480
be not enough to know what is

2442
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:41,519
happening in the code

2443
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:47,119
yes

2444
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:50,000
so i don't know

2445
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:54,560
if we have more questions or

2446
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:01,840
comments

2447
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:12,639
so we had an earlier question uh from

2448
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:14,400
sebastian um

2449
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:15,920
do you have some examples of what you

2450
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:17,840
used uh meta processing to do

2451
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,280
what's the most interesting slash

2452
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:22,560
complex projects you have done

2453
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:26,480
um actually

2454
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:30,718
until now the

2455
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:34,080
the examples are inside the distribution

2456
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,040
so

2457
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:39,440
uh if you if you check if you check the

2458
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:42,480
meta processing uh meta javascript

2459
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,880
folder of projects that is what i have

2460
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:45,920
done until now

2461
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:49,199
okay because it's a really new tool

2462
01:56:49,199 --> 01:56:52,400
and uh and we don't have users still

2463
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:56,000
so uh i have been i have been doing

2464
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,639
experiments with my students but as my

2465
01:56:58,639 --> 01:56:59,440
students are

2466
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,679
only like repeating these kind of

2467
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:03,599
examples i had to draw

2468
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:07,199
to play a sound so still we don't have

2469
01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:10,960
a really really complex projects

2470
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:14,239
because it's really really new tool and

2471
01:57:14,239 --> 01:57:17,679
we don't have still enough users

2472
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:20,719
so i guess from all these examples

2473
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:24,159
the the modus advances the arduino

2474
01:57:24,159 --> 01:57:27,840
arduino project that show you how to use

2475
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:30,080
the

2476
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:35,040
potentiometer the servo motor

2477
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,679
the digital input like all the all the

2478
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:38,080
things

2479
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:41,119
mix in only one project i guess that one

2480
01:57:41,119 --> 01:57:42,719
is the

2481
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:45,520
uh there is one one very beautiful that

2482
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:46,000
that

2483
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,480
it will be nice to show you that is the

2484
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:49,360
mouse game

2485
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:51,520
that is in the in the examples mouse

2486
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:53,360
game

2487
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:56,320
this mouse game are only eight lines of

2488
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:57,520
code

2489
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:00,800
plus three in the mouse tab

2490
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:04,840
so totally 11 lines of code

2491
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:08,639
and here uh

2492
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:11,040
you will have green green squares that

2493
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:12,239
appear

2494
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:15,280
randomly and

2495
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:17,679
i will remove the microphone so the idea

2496
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:18,400
is that with your

2497
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:20,400
with the mouse you have to remove the

2498
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,159
green the green

2499
01:58:22,159 --> 01:58:24,719
squares and every time you press it will

2500
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:27,440
make a sound

2501
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:31,280
so uh the idea is that don't let your

2502
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:32,000
screen

2503
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,679
get full green sometimes it's easy but

2504
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:38,159
sometimes it's not so easy

2505
01:58:38,159 --> 01:58:42,239
so uh if you try to to make this kind of

2506
01:58:42,239 --> 01:58:44,560
project in other programming languages

2507
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:47,920
you will be not able to do it in in 11

2508
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:49,760
lines

2509
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:53,360
so uh

2510
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:56,400
until now that is the the

2511
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:59,599
most advanced project we have done

2512
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:03,040
because obviously my time i am focusing

2513
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:05,440
is in the software in the interface

2514
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,280
fixing the box so i don't have enough

2515
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:08,080
time to

2516
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:10,719
do experiments with the software so i am

2517
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:11,760
trying to

2518
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:14,639
to share with all you and trying to find

2519
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:17,040
more users and maybe

2520
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,080
create a community that can share more

2521
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,480
advanced

2522

just few days ago if you if you create a

2537

project

2538
02:00:20,719 --> 02:00:23,840
and in the name you leave a space

2539
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:28,000
it will not work so you have here

2540
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,119
draw space one and and that is making

2541
02:00:31,119 --> 02:00:31,440
the

2542
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:35,119
the so you should you should save the

project

2544
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:39,520
draw one without the space

2545
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:42,560
and then it will work

2546
02:00:44,159 --> 02:00:47,679

2547
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:52,639
