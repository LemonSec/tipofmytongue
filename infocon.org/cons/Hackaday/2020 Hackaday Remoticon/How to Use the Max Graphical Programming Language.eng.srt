00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,680
[Music]

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,040
all right i'm gonna give everyone like

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,160
two two more minutes just to download

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,080
max if you haven't already download the

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,320
the uh actual workshop which is

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,880
a zip file in the chat right now um just

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,439
download it and zip it it's really small

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,240
we're gonna be going through that

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,000
together and if you happen to have a

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,680
second computer or monitor

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,840
um it's it's gonna be really helpful

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,760
part of the so

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,119
one of the advantages of doing things

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,599
this way um

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,079
no thank you uh one of the advantages of

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,840
doing things this way with max is

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,280
everything i gave you is is fully

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,320
interactive so you're going to be

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,320
looking at the exact same

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,640
thing that i'm looking at and you'll be

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,960
able to to click on it hack on it

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,760
keep it for later copy stuff out um but

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,360
the downside of that is

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,559
if you're trying to do it while i'm

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,960
doing it um it might it might get a

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,559
little confusing i'll try to call out

27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,280
when i will

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,960
when i will expect you to switch back

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,879
and forth um

30
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,079
so if you have a second monitor that'd

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,480
be awesome if not i did actually change

32
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,680
the colors of all

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,000
everything on my screen so um i got some

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
feedback from a dry run that that people

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,720
couldn't tell

36
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,920
if they were they were trying to click

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,880
on something and they didn't realize it

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,479
was actually the zoom call it was my my

39
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,280
version so

40
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,799
um everything on my screen's gonna be

41
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,840
pink everything on your screen is gonna

42
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,400
be kind of gray

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,600
all right um i'm gonna jump in because i

44
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,400
got a lot to cover

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,479
so um the first thing we're going to

46
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,439
want to do i'm going to get rid of this

47
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
we're going to open max if you haven't

48
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,680
already

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,960
um and we're going to open the

50
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,479
the project that i sent you what i sent

51
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,040
you is a it's called a max project

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,439
i have it as a as a recent project here

53
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,360
hopefully this is the correct one

54
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,119
um and you should see something like

55
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:51,439
this

56
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,720
i apologize some of the some of the

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,000
fonts are going to be a little small on

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,479
here

59
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,680
hopefully you're looking at the same

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,320
thing i'll try to zoom in when i can but

61
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,079
um yeah so

62
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,280
the the first thing you should see is

63
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,119
the is kind of the project root

64
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,360
screen um and what we're looking at is a

65
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,318
list of files basically in this project

66
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,560
uh so max project is made up of various

67
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,599
types of files

68
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,160
most of them are called patchers um and

69
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
a patcher is basically like a

70
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,480
it's it's a max window um so it's it's

71
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,520
what we're going to be building our

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,040
applications in

73
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,000
um and then the other content is like

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,160
media files or code files if you want to

75
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,560
add

76
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
your own code and those things will just

77
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,000
kind of poke

78
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,480
below the patcher files but for the most

79
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,360
part everything

80
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,280
i just tried to break things down almost

81
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
almost like a slide deck but everything

82
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,440
is going to be

83
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,080
interactive so so i'm going to introduce

84
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,599
myself with the with the first

85
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,640
slide here um so yeah they

86
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,360
already gave me a lovely introduction

87
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,319
thank you

88

free to never look at them again

90
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,959
uh though the hack at aio link will take

91
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,480
you to my page which has a link to the

92
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,560
project page if you forget where it is

93
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,080
um yeah i'm super excited to be here i'm

94
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,560
i'm

95
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,080
a big big hackaday fan um and

96
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
i'm a big max fan so i i it's it's an

97
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
amazing opportunity to be able to talk

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,959
about it in this

99
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,040
in this venue um and i want to get get a

100
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,400
disclaimer out of the way i

101
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,159
so max is made by a company called

102
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,440
cycling 74.

103
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,879
i don't work for them i've never worked

104
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,360
for them uh i'm not getting anything

105
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,239
from them

106
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,840
for this in fact i tweeted at them a

107
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,239
bunch of times desperately to try to get

108
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:28,959
their attention

109
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,159
and they they didn't really notice me so

110
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,519
just know i i'm you know i i don't feel

111
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,120
like you have to buy this software i

112
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,239
know you wouldn't but

113
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,840
um you know i'm not trying to push this

114
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,519
on anybody it's it's just a thing i'm

115
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,959
just a fan for real

116
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,319
um and i will say too there is max has

117
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,120
kind of a

118
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,080
a sibling application called pure data

119
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,959
um they have a

120
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,040
shared history but pure data is like the

121
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,239
open source

122
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,920
version and max is kind of the more

123
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,280
commercial version

124
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,840
i would have loved to have have done

125
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
this workshop with pure data

126
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
uh just knowing that it's hackaday and

127
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
we love our open source stuff but

128
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
it just didn't really it's it's a little

129
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,599
bit harder it's like it's like driving

130
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,000
stick

131
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,040
versus max is kind of like a nice a nice

132
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,760
you know automatic minivan um so check

133
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,279
out pure data though pure data is cool

134
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,040
because it runs like max only runs on

135
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,959
mac and windows pure data runs anywhere

136
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,120
you can run it on a raspberry pi you can

137
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
embed it in an android application

138
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,440
um you can't i think people have got it

139
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,199
running in a browser now

140
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,680
uh you can embed it in unity it's it's

141
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
really cool that's pure

142
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,520
data um that's that's the open source

143
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,400
version and i

144
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,759
if anyone's using linux that's what i

145
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,120
ask you to install because it's it's

146
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,240
mostly similar but

147
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,840
uh yeah it's not gonna be quite the same

148
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,160
all right without further ado i'm gonna

149
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,400
jump into the first my first max patch

150
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,000
that i'm that i'm presenting to you

151
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
obviously not counting my my intro here

152
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,840
um and if you didn't notice you can

153
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,840
you can click these these buttons

154
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,680
all right open up uh zero one

155
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,240
underscore intro please um like i said

156
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,639
earlier yours isn't gonna be

157
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,600
um white or pink it's gonna be white but

158
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,320
that's just

159
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,000
to differentiate so um this is this is

160
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
maybe possibly hopefully your first max

161
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,280
patcher

162
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,199
this one is meant for you to play with

163
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
um we're going to be coming back to this

164
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,479
a bunch um and i

165
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,400
i wanna another disclaimer we're gonna

166
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,520
leave this slide

167
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
and you're probably not gonna understand

168
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,280
fully what's going on i designed it that

169
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,759
way

170
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,000
uh this is just this is this is a hook

171
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,440
right i wanna just show you some of the

172
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,320
things you can do

173
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,520
and we're gonna we're gonna refer back

174
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,120
to this as we go so i'm gonna go through

175
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,479
it kind of quick i'm not gonna tell you

176
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,199
everything

177
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,560
just know that we're gonna we're gonna

178
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,039
address most of it um after the fact but

179
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,560
uh i'm gonna encourage everyone to just

180
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,240
take a few minutes and start clicking

181
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,160
around on your screen and start playing

182
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,520
around with things

183
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,840
um you know these are mostly interactive

184
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,440
elements you can you can change

185
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,759
yeah i just just try it out see see what

186
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,120
makes sense to you

187
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,680
um this is a this is just a simple

188
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,280
application built with max i did this in

189
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,120
in

190
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
a half hour for what it's worth um but

191
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,400
yeah take just take a few few seconds

192
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,840
play around uh

193
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,560
you if you if you use slack for for work

194
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,800
you you probably recognize this parrot

195
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,880
it's a party parrot why he's partying

196
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,919
who's who's to say

197
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,479
cool all right so i'm going to tell you

198
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,840
some more secrets about this

199
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
about this max patcher so this patcher

200
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
is currently in presentation mode

201
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,080
um and what that means is i'm hiding all

202
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,840
of the implementation details of

203
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,360
of this patch from you um so

204
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,639
you can play with it you can move things

205
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,319
around you can interact with it but just

206
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,520
by looking at it from this view you

207
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,000
don't know

208
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,240
how it's how it's connected how it how

209
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,360
it's programmed

210
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
um so uh you know

211
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,639
i'm gonna tell you all how to take it

212
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,000
out of presentation mode and you're

213
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,800
gonna you're gonna

214
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,720
start to take a little glimpse inside my

215
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,000
brain so uh

216
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,759
to get out of presentation mode there's

217
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,120
a little yellow icon

218
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,039
at the bottom when you hover it actually

219
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,800
says patching mode

220
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
but um you're gonna click that and

221
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,960
you're gonna see a few new things it's

222
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,080
gonna everything's gonna expand a little

223
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,360
bit and you're gonna see some new stuff

224
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,919
on the screen

225
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,759
so this is what programming in max

226
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,400
looks like so i say programming um max

227
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,199
is

228
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,960
it's a it's a visual programming

229
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,639
language um

230
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,039
whatever that means to you but basically

231
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,880
this is this is what it looks like

232
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,919
if you're if you're building more

233
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,520
complex things you're going to see a lot

234
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,560
more of this you're going to see

235
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,759
spaghetti everywhere

236
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,960
if you're like me and you're not if

237
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
you're not organized about it but the

238
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,520
idea is

239
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,039
you see these these blocky looking

240
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,880
things and you see these liny looking

241
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,000
things we're going to talk a lot about

242
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,520
what those are

243
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,360
but this is what max programming looks

244
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
like so

245
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,400
again i'm not going to go over

246
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,759
everything in detail right now but i

247
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,800
encourage you to

248
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,639
to click around um and and see

249
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,560
see what everything what everything does

250
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,720
now

251
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,039
in order to reprogram this patch you

252
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,199
actually have to unlock it

253
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,360
so there's a but there's a little lock

254
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,280
button down in the bottom left corner

255
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,039
or you can command click on a mac

256
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,680
i think it's control click on windows to

257
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,599
to toggle the lock on the patcher so if

258
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,319
it's locked

259
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,240
you can't do that much but if you unlock

260
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,440
it which we're going to be doing that a

261
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,160
lot

262
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
um you'll be able to kind of move things

263
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,000
around and that's actually how you

264
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,479
reprogram things um

265
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,000
cool so um and also if you

266
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
if you want to play around you can you

267
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
can this will load in any

268
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,159
any gif gif uh whatever you call it or

269
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,559
or

270
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,839
i think movies you think you can load

271
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,480
like an arbitrary mp3 and p4 in here and

272
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,160
like change the color and stuff

273
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,480
um but anyway i'm gonna just move some

274
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,839
things around i'm gonna show you like

275
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,279
the types of things you can change and

276
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,000
what what

277
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,560
programming max looks like so um what do

278
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,000
we see here we see this this

279
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,519
on off x button looking thing we have a

280
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,480
clock

281
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,560
a block that says clock we have a block

282
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,839
that says linear play

283
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,920
back we have a block that says random

284
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,320
playback they're all interconnected

285
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,920
um so watch what happens when i

286
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,760
uh switch i'm going to switch this

287
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,800
little line i'm going to delete this

288
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,640
and let's put the random playback in

289
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,880
there and see what happens

290
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,320
okay cool so that's interesting um

291
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,640
let's let's let's wire this up too let's

292
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,399
put the random playback in this

293
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,760
third little hole here and see what

294
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,040
happens all right cool

295
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,080
and then you know let's do linear

296
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,800
playback let's

297
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160
let's wrap that in here and see what

298
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,720
happens oh boy

299
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,800
it probably looks even crazier over over

300
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,839
zoom but

301
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,240
um yeah

302
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,040
feel free to do the same if you want um

303
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
but i'm gonna i'm gonna move on now i

304
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,000
just wanted to kind of

305
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,240
give you a little preview here uh also

306
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,760
this this patch is not very efficient

307
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,000
and

308
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
your computer is probably uh probably

309
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,040
trying to take off right now i see a

310
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,640
question where is the wire mode so

311
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,000
that's when your

312
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,560
your patch is unlocked so you want to

313
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,440
either command

314
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,320
click or control click and then you'll

315
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,800
see

316
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,279
the wires oh and you also have to be out

317
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,480
of um

318
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,760
out of presentation mode to do that

319
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
all right let's close this one out i

320
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,880
recommend closing it because it is

321
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,480
it is pretty computationally expensive

322
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,680
and it's just going gonna run

323
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
um all right so i gave you a little a

324
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,320
little taste um

325
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,240
and this this is just a demo i did for

326
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,040
this particular brand of presentation

327
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,880
uh there's a lot of different really

328
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,800
cool inputs and outputs you can use for

329
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,519
macs

330
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,120
all of which are not all of which many

331
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
of which are listed here um but it's

332
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
it's hard to demo a lot of these

333
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,680
virtually so um that i'm gonna i'm gonna

334
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,720
keep going back to that intro uh as

335
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,200
a reference because it's a it's a you

336
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
know it's a silly demo but it's a pretty

337
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
complete demo to be honest so

338
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,040
um but yeah these are the these are the

339
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,640
types of things you can you can

340
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,279
you can use as as inputs and outputs

341
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,480
when you're writing programs in macs um

342
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,959
and it's it's a really great way to like

343
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
mash things together right it's like you

344
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,200
you want to take some video and you want

345
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,399
to process it in some way

346
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,480
and you want to use that data to send a

347
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,519
tweet right

348
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,640
um max makes max is designed to make

349
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
that type of thing really easy where you

350
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,440
have some big

351
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,240
pre-built component some some you know

352
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,560
some

353
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,959
input and you have some other thing and

354
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,320
you just want to literally

355
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,160
click a little wire and drag them

356
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,720
together um

357
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,399
and the other thing so what i like about

358
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,920
it and what this this uh

359
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,839
particular workshop is really meant to

360
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,600
show is i use it a lot to

361
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,360
to simulate uh inputs and outputs so um

362
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
if you're you know you're waiting on

363
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
some some piece of hardware to come to

364
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,480
to feed you a signal or something um

365
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
max is a really quick way to to simulate

366
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,240
any kind of

367
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,160
input or output until you're you're

368
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,279
ready to to like

369
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,279
bring in the real implementation it's

370
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,920
it's a really just awesome toolbox for

371
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,160
doing anything on a computer and it's

372
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,279
it's nice because it's

373
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,839
uh you know it's it's modular i think

374
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,120
it's

375
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,560
a little bit easier to follow for

376
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,639
beginners um for

377
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,800
than learning to write code i think you

378
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,399
know clicking and dragging things feels

379
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,279
a bit more

380
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,600
natural um to some people i'm saying

381
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,680
that anecdotally so if if you disagree

382
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,120
please tell me after but

383
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,639
um that's that's kind of how i feel

384
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,320
about it um and what i

385
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,079
love about max and and i'm trying to

386
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,079
demonstrate this with this workshop is

387
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,480
everything you do in macs you can you

388
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,720
can copy and paste it

389
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,279
anywhere else um and max encourages that

390
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,399
right it's like i think as

391
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,480
as programmers we sometimes feel guilty

392
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,920
about how much we we contribute

393
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,279
ourselves versus just

394
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,720
pulling from what somebody else did but

395
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,399
max like leans into that

396
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
and so you'll notice like every part of

397
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,680
these

398
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,760
these patchers that i sent you if you

399
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,880
unlock it

400
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,519
you can you can change it all you want

401
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,040
you know you can copy stuff you can

402
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,519
delete

403
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,560
stuff um and max encourages that max

404
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
wants you to just use what's there

405
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,440
um in in the quickest way possible and

406
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,519
and and make cool stuff and and without

407
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,040
having to worry about the

408
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,920
the really nitty-gritty details um

409
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,680
but if you want to dive in you can

410
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,079
always

411
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,800
you can always go lower and lower uh if

412
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,839
you want once you get comfortable

413
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,279
so yeah i'm again i'm not trying to

414
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,480
speak on behalf of

415
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,360
cycling 74 disclaimer uh but that's how

416
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,160
i interpret

417
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,600
how they design this stuff i'm going to

418
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,120
look at the questions quick why aren't

419
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,040
the patches listed in alphanumeric

420
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,160
alphanumeric order uh because i'm an

421
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,480
idiot

422
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
yeah don't read too much into that i i

423
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,920
was scrambling to do stuff

424
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,480
um earlier today also i'm i'm realizing

425
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,920
i'm i'm probably looking at a slightly

426
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,360
different version than the one you guys

427
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,399
have so

428
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,519
i'm gonna call out the numbers

429
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,680
specifically it should be the same but

430
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,800
um please let me know

431
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,040
cool all right uh so let's talk about

432
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,519
max

433
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,399
objects um and i this is this is like

434
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:16,639
the

435
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,120
the the lowest level stuff and i promise

436
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,880
you we're gonna get through this quickly

437
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,480
and once we do we're gonna look at some

438
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,959
really cool integrations with like

439
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,279
my microphone um we're gonna do some

440
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,199
stuff with the internet uh

441
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,880
and if you look at that towards the end

442
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,560
of the project you'll see

443
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,839
you'll get kind of a preview where we're

444
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,680
going but just bear with me i i

445
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,399
i believe deeply that if you if you

446
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,040
learn the

447
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,720
the the nitty gritty of this stuff if

448
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,199
you learn the um the essentials

449
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,279
um you'll walk away from this

450
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,680
presentation like pretty dangerous

451
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,399
uh with max um you know you'll be able

452
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,000
to copy and paste

453
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,720
code from wherever and um and and build

454
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,320
your own thing so just bear with me as

455
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,680
we get through this it's gonna seem like

456
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,279
we're far away from building cool stuff

457
00:14:59,279 --> 00:14:59,680
but

458
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,240
i promise the jump from this to the cool

459
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,079
stuff is not big and that's that's one

460
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,120
of max's strengths

461
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,680
so um anyways this is a max object

462
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,600
i'm gonna i'm gonna unlock um and just

463
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
click around here this is a max object

464
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,399
uh this particular one is empty it does

465
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,720
nothing you can see it has no text in it

466
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,600
um it's it's just floating there just

467
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,720
lives there it doesn't it doesn't do

468
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,360
anything

469
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,000
uh so objects have what are called

470
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,639
inlets

471
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,680
and outlets i'm going to zoom in a

472
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,440
little bit hopefully you can see

473
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,199
um so inlets are on the top

474
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,240
of uh of objects and

475
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,800
outlets are on the bottom and those are

476
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
just holes that you can connect

477
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,440
things to this object with um and you'll

478
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,399
notice if you hover

479
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,279
over them you you get some nice details

480
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,079
about what that

481
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,240
what that particular inlet or outlet is

482
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,440
supposed to do

483
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,040
and you'll notice that the md object is

484
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,959
actually called j bogus

485
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,959
uh which i think is a fun little fun

486
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,720
little detail um

487
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
but yeah so this doesn't give you any

488
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,759
useful information because this object

489
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,040
doesn't do anything

490
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,399
so other objects when we get to more

491
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,279
more interesting objects um when you

492
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,360
want to send things to that object

493
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,120
you pass things to their inlet you

494
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
connect the wire to the inlet

495
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,079
and if you want to receive data from

496
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,040
an object you listen to the outlet um

497
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,079
and

498
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,360
the objects can have arbitrarily many uh

499
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,920
inlets and outlets and each one might

500
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,440
have a special job

501
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
and you just kind of have to go through

502
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,480
and learn learn what they do and that's

503
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,839
why they give you the documentation here

504
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,120
is you can just kind of hover over and

505
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,920
see what they

506
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,279
what each inlet or outlet does um

507
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,680
and yeah so a max patch you know the

508
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
thing we're looking at

509
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,839
um hold on sorry i keep looking at the

510
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,040
chat what if you pass an

511
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,480
output to another output it won't let

512
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,639
you do that uh feel free to unlock

513
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,160
the patcher and try though um so a max

514
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,639
patch is just a big pipeline of of

515
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,720
objects like at its core some of the

516
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,079
objects

517
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,759
end up looking different but at the end

518
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,760
of the day a max patch is just

519
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,359
objects connected to objects it's just

520
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,199
this big web

521
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,480
um and and like that's that's kind of a

522
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,599
that's kind of an important thing to

523
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,799
internalize like when you're looking at

524
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,839
a big scary thing

525
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,400
just remember it's all it is it's just

526
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,839
inlets and outlets connected to each

527
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,240
other

528
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,280
that's how everything is built um and

529
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,959
just want to point out to like some some

530
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,640
something it's a little bit subtle i

531
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,439
think is

532
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,919
the fact that you can connect many

533
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,640
outlets to one inlet and vice versa

534
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,039
um and so that makes max really great

535
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,840
for

536
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,640
um kind of experimenting without having

537
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,520
to change

538
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,840
your your patching as you go so like if

539
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,440
i wanted to add some functionality

540
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,160
without changing the existing setup here

541
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,559
i'm just going to alt drag to copy this

542
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,679
object

543
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,760
and i can wire that up you know

544
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,880
separately and

545
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,799
you'll notice i didn't end up i didn't

546
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,360
change anything so i can i can kind of

547
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,280
experiment on the fly and add on the fly

548
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,039
without without breaking stuff

549
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,440
it reminds me of a modular synth i'm so

550
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,559
glad you said that because

551
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,799
they have a full like getting ahead of

552
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,840
myself here but

553
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,320
um when we're done with this click the

554
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,840
beep button if you want to if you want

555
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,160
to

556
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
have fun with some modular synth stuff

557
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,679
uh sorry

558
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,000
so yeah it is it's like a modular synth

559
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,039
you have full control

560
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,960
over the patching you can you can add

561
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,720
stuff remove stuff on the fly

562
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,400
um yeah

563
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,559
uh what's happening inside the object

564
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,000
where's that code and how can i create

565
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,960
new objects we'll get there

566
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,720
cool um so creating objects uh so the

567
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,919
first thing you gotta do

568
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,559
is unlock your patcher and if you see

569
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,080
lines around the text that

570
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,160
generally indicates you're unlocked um

571
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,200
and you just put your mouse

572
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,720
wherever you want to put the object you

573
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
can either hit the n key or as i learned

574
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,960
today you can just double click

575
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,799
that creates an empty object and then

576
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,559
you just type the name

577
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,280
of the object you're trying to use um

578
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,080
this is not

579
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,440
this is not a real object i'm just

580
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,280
typing to show you um

581
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,160
so if i if i click out of this it's

582
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,120
going to be like hey

583
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,720
no that's not a thing it doesn't give me

584
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,480
any inlets or outlets but we'll get to

585
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,600
that

586
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,440
and again just reiterating you can copy

587
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,880
and paste from anywhere too so you can

588
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,400
just click on one

589
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,919
command c or control c to copy command

590
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,960
c v or ctrl v to paste and you can do

591
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,799
that between patchers too you know that

592
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,240
doesn't have to be just within this

593
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,080
patcher

594
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
um so discovering objects so i taught

595
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,200
you how to make one but like what are

596
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,320
you gonna make you don't know what any

597
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,200
of them are yet

598
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
um so there's a few there's a few other

599
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,919
ways to to make objects

600
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,600
one of my favorites is at the top of the

601
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,280
patcher here you get all these lovely

602
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,400
drop downs

603
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,880
um and you can click and see there's all

604
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,679
different ones

605
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,640
available and you just click on

606
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,160
whichever one you want to put in and

607
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,760
it'll it'll just insert it and you can

608
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,200
move it around where you need

609
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,520
um there's also there's an objects tab

610
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,400
over here

611
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,200
uh that's a little more overwhelming in

612
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,080
my opinion

613
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,039
um or you can start with an object uh an

614
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,240
empty object and

615
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
like say i wanted an object that adds

616
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,720
two numbers together if i just type add

617
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,120
um you can see they their their search

618
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,480
functionality is really great and they

619
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,159
give you a bunch of options so

620
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,919
uh i i have found a bunch of things that

621
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,360
i was looking for just by just by kind

622
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:17,679
of

623
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,039
typing in words that i thought were

624
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,919
relevant but for the most part i use the

625
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,120
i use up here um learning about objects

626
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,960
so how do you know what these objects do

627
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,520
um so let's let's just pick pick one an

628
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,880
arbitrary one here

629
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,480
this is the button object or the bang

630
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
object um so there's a few ways to learn

631
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,000
about this object

632
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,840
one i already told you you hover over

633
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,520
the inlets and outlets

634
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,000
and that gives you uh some documentation

635
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,320
as to what that's doing

636
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,600
the other thing you can do and this is

637
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,080
this is in my opinion one of my favorite

638
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,360
things about max

639
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,200
you right click and you open help

640
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,840
and you get you get their their full

641
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,360
documentation

642
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,520
all of which is completely interactive

643
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,360
right this is just a patch um

644
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,600
and so and they generally do an amazing

645
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,679
job of demonstrating how to use

646
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,480
any given object and of course because

647
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,679
it's a patch i can

648
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,440
literally just copy the the objects out

649
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,799
of the help

650
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,600
uh the help window here and just put it

651
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,440
right inside mine and it'll it'll work

652
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,840
uh also you know their their online

653
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,919
documentation and forums are

654
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,120
amazing in fact this honestly most of

655
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,240
the stuff i'm going through now

656
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,080
they they're they're like intro to max

657
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,720
is is kind of similar

658
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,240
um tweaking objects so uh there's a few

659
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,600
options here this is for if you want to

660
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
change the appearance or or sometimes

661
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,799
you want to change more advanced

662
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,000
behavior

663
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,679
um yeah right click for for help

664
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,679
um so uh you can click this yellow

665
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,120
button and it'll give you some

666
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,799
some attributes that you can change so

667
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,400
like this particular object you can

668
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,240
change the colors of

669
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,720
um it has different prototypes with

670
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,400
different styles

671
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,120
all that stuff but the the really useful

672
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,960
window is the inspector window

673
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,360
so you click on an object to select it

674
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,679
and then there's this i button over here

675
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,919
uh to open this selector or sorry the

676
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,720
inspector

677
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,960
um and this is this is a little

678
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,760
overwhelming

679
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,360
in my opinion especially if you're first

680
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,720
starting but you can kind of guess what

681
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,039
some of this stuff does right like

682
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,640
you know these colors right if i change

683
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,000
this i can kind of guess what's gonna

684
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,280
happen

685
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,039
um yeah so they offer a lot of

686
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,840
customization

687
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,440
but yeah we'll poke back into the

688
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,559
inspector window later

689
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,360
um okay i'm i'm trying to be conscious

690
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,880
of time here what do i got a half

691
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,240
half hour left yeah all right uh so

692
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,840
i'm gonna talk about the most important

693
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
objects in my opinion

694
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,480
um and then we're gonna then we're gonna

695
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,039
start

696
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,960
playing around a bit more so the first

697
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,640
object you should know is the print

698
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,320
object it has one inlet no outlets

699
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,480
and basically it takes any data in and

700
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
it will print it out for you in the max

701
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,440
console so that's that lives over here

702
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,000
um

703
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,200
right in the middle of the patch on the

704
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,120
right and you open that up and you might

705
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,559
see a bunch of noise or you might see

706
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,919
nothing but

707
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,039
we'll we'll see what it looks like in a

708
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,480
second basically anything you feed into

709
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,039
here

710
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,000
will will show up on the right and um

711
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
that's very helpful for debugging if you

712
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,159
don't know

713
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,240
like what what's coming out of some some

714
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,760
outlet you can just hook it up to a

715
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,320
print

716
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,080
object and you'll you'll see it

717
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,760
happening

718
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,440
the next object to know is the message

719
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,880
object um

720
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,280
so that holds some like a either a

721
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,400
command

722
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,159
or you know some data that you just want

723
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,600
to store temporarily

724
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,240
uh but it also doubles as a button so if

725
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,919
you lock your patcher command

726
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,880
click or control click and click it um

727
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,000
you can see it it

728
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,600
kind of indicates like hey you're you're

729
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,240
interacting with me

730
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,279
um and if we look at its outlet here uh

731
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,159
it says it sends the message outlet is

732
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,440
the message result

733
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,360
so what this does is message object does

734
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
when you click it

735
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,360
it just sends this data out of that

736
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,120
outlet

737
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,279
so um so perfect demonstration let's

738
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,720
just hook those two up together you can

739
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,559
see the outlet of the message is going

740
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,320
to the inlet of print

741
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,679
and when i click this now we can see on

742
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,799
the right in the console

743
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,120
we're printing whatever message is in

744
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,799
here and if i want to change it i can

745
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,880
unlock i can double click and and i can

746
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,400
type whatever i want

747
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,000
uh and again i can click here and uh

748
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,400
yeah that's that's message hooked up to

749
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,679
print so that's your first that's your

750
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,880
first like

751
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,559
patch cable connection these these lines

752
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,159
are called patch cables by the way

753
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,640
uh so you know congrats that's your

754
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,600
that's your first

755
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,640
your first patch um

756
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,640
okay uh so just quickly another thing

757
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,440
with messages

758
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,279
that it's kind of interesting um the

759
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,080
right inlet actually sets the content

760
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,600
of the message the left inlet is used to

761
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,200
trigger the message so the left inlet

762
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,279
behaves the same as if you were to click

763
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,720
this thing

764
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,320
but the right inlet sets the message so

765
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,840
if you if you lock it and click you can

766
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,960
see

767
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,600
it's changing the content but since

768
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,520
we're not triggering it in any way it

769
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,320
doesn't get printed

770
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,559
but then i can print it here

771
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,120
cool um one last thing one last

772
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,720
patcher or object i want you to know

773
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,480
about is the patcher

774
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
object which is which is a little

775
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,080
confusing uh but basically

776
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,360
this lets you wrap any like set of

777
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,400
objects as

778
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,360
as a uh as its own little mini patcher

779
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,720
it's called a sub patcher

780
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,400
um and so if if i if i

781
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,480
click on this my message you see you see

782
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,679
it'll print

783
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,720
you said colon my message and the reason

784
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,000
it does that is because if you double

785
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,559
click

786
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,640
this patcher uh object

787
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,320
it actually opens up my own little

788
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,000
custom thing that i i made

789
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,840
and so this is just a nice way to

790
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,520
organize things like if you have a bunch

791
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,279
of objects that live together as their

792
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:11,919
own

793
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,400
like logical unit of things i like to

794
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
wrap it up in a in a patcher object and

795
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,640
just have it live by itself

796
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:25,840
it keeps it keeps things clean

797
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,840
cool all right still cruising so we can

798
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,440
get to the fun stuff

799
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,880
one last one last uh

800
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,679
kind of dry run through here so we're

801
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,000
opening

802
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,840
up the data types uh patch

803
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840
um and so i'm just gonna tell you what

804
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,279
types of data there are there are a few

805
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,400
different types of data

806
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,320
that flow through these gray patch

807
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,240
cables um

808
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,799
so the first one uh is is called a

809
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,360
symbol

810
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,159
a symbol is just a word uh is how i like

811
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,159
to think of it it's generic text with no

812
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,039
spaces

813
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,760
so those are alphanumeric characters um

814
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,240
so

815
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,360
letters and numbers as long as there are

816
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,559
no spaces

817
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,760
and at least one um like a through z

818
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,559
character

819
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,679
it's a symbol and uh again i have it

820
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,159
hooked up through the print window

821
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,880
so just so you can see it printing out

822
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,520
the second type uh is is an int which if

823
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,200
you write code you're probably familiar

824
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,679
with this

825
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,679
uh that's short for an integer so that's

826
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,760
a number that's just a whole number

827
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,600
negative or positive from you know

828
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,039
super low to super high we're not going

829
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,640
to worry about the restrictions but

830
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,520
um that's that's all that's all it is um

831
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:39,919
so

832
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,799
no no a through z characters it's just

833
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,919
it's just a number

834
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,279
um and yeah something i want to call out

835
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,320
uh early on is that

836
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,600
this message object uh hex i actually

837
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,279
don't know how hex behaves in here

838
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,320
but sorry the message object

839
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,320
um holds can hold any any type of data

840
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,840
which can get confusing so just keep

841
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,880
that in mind we're going to use the

842
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,039
message object over and over again

843
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,480
but each of these examples is

844
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,080
demonstrating a different type

845
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,279
of data so far we've done symbol int

846
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,240
the next one is float so that's a that's

847
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,960
a number with

848
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,600
a decimal point uh if you're unfamiliar

849
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,640
um

850
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,360
and again arbitrarily low to arbitrarily

851
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:21,919
high

852
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,320
uh and sometimes one thing that threw me

853
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,360
off for a while is sometimes it's

854
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,640
displayed

855
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,120
with with no zero appended so if it's

856
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,080
just 1.0

857
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,760
it's just one dot um yeah so that's a

858
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,080
float

859
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,480
the next type of data which is which i

860
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,679
think is a little more interesting is

861
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,720
called a bang

862
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
a bang is just a generic event it's just

863
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,080
a moment in time

864
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,480
it's got no other data tied to it it's

865
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,320
just it's just bang it's a trigger it's

866
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,880
a it's a

867
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,279
it's a moment in time that's it um you i

868
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,240
like to think of it as just like a

869
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,279
button click

870
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,559
uh so you click it

871
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,880
and it prints out as the word bang which

872
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
is confusing

873
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,640
um but it's this object which

874
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,720
you'll use a bunch is is is the button

875
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,960
object it's it's job is

876
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,159
uh output any message as a bang so this

877
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:12,880
this object

878
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,080
always outputs just a bang how is the

879
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,840
data type set what determines the

880
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,279
difference between integer

881
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,760
99 and the word string 99 um that's

882
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,039
that's what's confusing

883
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,880
um it's really just how you type it if

884
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,200
you want the string if you want a symbol

885
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,440
for 99 you have to put quotes around it

886
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,799
if you don't put quotes

887
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,480
and it's just a number it'll interpret

888
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,799
it as a as a number

889
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,159
it is not it's it's a little dangerous

890
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,159
in the last type that i want to show you

891
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,279
is the uh

892
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,159
is the list type a list is just a

893
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,840
combination of

894
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,720
one or many or i guess more than one of

895
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,520
the above

896
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,720
data types uh separated by spaces

897
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,399
so it looks like a sentence but it's

898
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,320
actually a list of of

899
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,200
things um so this is a list of nine

900
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,000
things

901
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,120
we have the zero dot this

902
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,320
is a list of nine

903
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,360
things bang

904
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,039
and that again it just prints out normal

905
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,559
um yeah you can look at the so there's

906
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,399
some other types i listed at the bottom

907
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,159
basically if you don't see a gray patch

908
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,360
cable that means you're dealing with

909
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,799
some more complex data

910
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,520
like an audio signal or uh this is how

911
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,640
you'd send video around

912
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,320
i'm not going to touch those just know

913
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,840
if you're not dealing with a gray cable

914
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,440
you might be you might have to look some

915
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,080
other stuff up

916
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,840
cool

917
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,240
don't save um

918
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,559
yeah all right let's let's go back to

919
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,480
our let's go back to the intro

920
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,120
so a list is what separates spen a list

921
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,520
is when spaces separate the words yes

922
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,039
though if you if you have numbers

923
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,559
separated by spaces

924
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,960
it's a list of numbers but the key there

925
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,399
is it's separated

926
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,200
if there's spaces that means it's a list

927
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,600
um

928
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,120
all right so let's let's just revisit

929
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,200
this quickly and see

930
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
see if things make a little more sense

931
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
um so

932
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,559
so you can see these these objects that

933
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,640
i have here uh they have the little p in

934
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,080
front of them meaning that they're

935
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,399
sub patchers so if you want you can

936
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,039
double click into those and you can see

937
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,880
uh what i'm actually doing under the

938
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,640
hood i'm not going to explain it in

939
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,000
detail but

940
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,320
just know that those were objects that i

941
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,760
thought were worth kind of wrapping as

942
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,080
their own thing

943
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,679
couldn't find a type patch uh

944
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,279
yes type you're looking for route type

945
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,159
i'll show you that in a minute um cool

946
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:44,799
so p

947
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,640
clock we'll look at that that's just a

948
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,840
you know it's it's a it

949
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,440
ends up just being a metronome under the

950
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,760
hood but the point is like i have

951
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,559
decided to wrap things up in subpatchers

952
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,720
and uh we know that this object we've

953
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,440
seen this object is a is a bang object

954
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,799
um and so yeah when we click it

955
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,399
this we know we know exactly what's

956
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,840
happening on this cable and it even

957
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,640
tells me it's a bang

958
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,519
um what else wait i think we've learned

959
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,039
anything else oh we see video

960
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,480
flowing through this little cable down

961
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,640
here uh and then

962
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,559
yeah we have some on off functionality

963
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,360
that's a button if we look at this cable

964
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,720
uh it's just showing zero or one for on

965
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,720
and off

966
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,159
cool all right we'll come we'll come

967
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,440
back to this again i just wanted people

968
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:31,840
to

969
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,919
look at this again in a in a slightly

970
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,159
new context

971
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,120
um all right actually let's let's skip

972
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,559
ahead let's let's look at the more the

973
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:40,960
more

974
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,279
some of the more interesting uh things

975
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,559
we can we can do with this

976
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,039
um i'm gonna i'm gonna just slide all

977
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,640
this stuff down

978
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,720
i i really wanted to emphasize like i

979
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,240
know i spent you know

980
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,799
we have 25 minutes left i spent a lot of

981
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,039
time talking about like this really

982
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,159
really low level stuff um but

983
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,480
now that you know how to connect inlets

984
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,320
to outlets like you know how to program

985
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,080
in max and as long as you can

986
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,679
read documentation about what these

987
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,760
objects do um

988
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,679
and you know like oh this is expecting

989
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,519
numbers or this is expecting symbols

990
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,279
and you know what those things are now

991
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,880
uh you're

992
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,640
you're like ready to go so let's let's

993
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,720
let's dive ahead and look at like

994
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,960
um let's look at this the sound input

995
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,760
uh patch that i uh that i i sent to you

996
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,080
that's

997
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,120
that's number 10

998
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,600
probably like 15 minutes all right i'm

999
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,279
going to go i'm going to go quicker then

1000
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,440
um cool so um i'm going to show you this

1001
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,360
this cluster of objects here

1002
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,840
is uh is is for an onset detector which

1003
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,159
means it's going to listen to my audio

1004
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,360
i'm going to options audio status make

1005
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,480
sure i got to just switch my microphone

1006
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,000
um i'm going to turn this microphone on

1007
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,320
and so this onset detector object its

1008
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,519
job is it takes

1009
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,080
some audio and it outputs a bang and so

1010
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,840
you watch when i clap

1011
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,440
it it does a pretty good job of

1012
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,239
detecting you know audio onsets so

1013
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,639
what i can do i can just take take this

1014
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,159
as it is

1015
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,599
copy it and i'm going to make i'll just

1016
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,960
make the bird dance with it right i'll

1017
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,879
put it in this patcher

1018
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,759
i'll go here

1019
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,440
right so my point is you now have this

1020
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
onset detector object forever

1021
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,599
um and and you can use it you know what

1022
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,719
a bang is it's just

1023
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,079
it's just an event um

1024
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,560
you can you can send that out uh you can

1025
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,119
use it

1026
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,199
wherever wherever you need to you that's

1027
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,960
that's it's yours forever now i give it

1028
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,719
to you i actually didn't make it

1029
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,399
i i did credit the the person here

1030
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,598
i'm still giving it to you forever

1031
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,240
cool um let's let's do another example

1032
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,839
here um

1033
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,760
uh what else do we want to do all right

1034
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760

does is

1045
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,440
it listens to my chat and forwards

1046
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,800
those messages into my max patch here so

1047

1056
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,800
se if you send messages with the format

1057
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,720
um parameter space and then a number

1058
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,079
so for example parameter

1059
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,839

1073
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,280
and uh like you can make your own twitch

1074

so i'm gonna uh i'm gonna do

1081
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,320
so i'm gonna create an object called

1082
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,079
send object which

1083
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,240
lets me send i send data between

1084
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,320
patchers i'm gonna call it send

1085
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,720
bird

1086
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,160
and then in here i'm gonna uh

1087
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,359
i'm gonna create a receive object i'm

1089
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,400
i'm gonna spell bird correctly and now

1090
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,240
as i type in my twitch chat here

1091
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,240
parameter

1092
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,839
zero uh i can change the color

1093
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,200
using twitch

1094
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,440
so if you all wanted to spam me yeah

1095
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,240
there we go there we go

1096
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,760
that doesn't be on the range it max is

1097
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,320
at 127 as a as a hint but

1098
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,720
cool so again you know i i i feel a

1099
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,000
little guilty about not being able

1100
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,440
to really dive into what all these

1101
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,520
things are doing but i want to emphasize

1102
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,240
like

1103
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,160
it doesn't really matter like just just

1104
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,640
copy this and paste it where you need to

1105
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,960
um when things are when when things are

1106
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,880
well documented which i'm sorry

1107
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,400
mine my objects are not um

1108
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,160
like it should be it should be obvious

1109
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,000
on on how things work like this is

1110
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,359
this object here uh it's just it's just

1111
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,960
a number that comes out of this it's

1112
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,400
just a whole number

1113
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,200
um and so you know how to use numbers

1114
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,480
you've seen that already

1115
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,079
and you can pipe that wherever you need

1116
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,200
to need to go with it

1117
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,520
sweet um all right so now i'm gonna give

1118
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,000
people time to play around a bit

1119
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,040
uh i created a

1120
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,520
um let me close all this

1121
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,800
i created a uh a playground

1122
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,160
patch um and you can open that and it's

1123
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,839
pretty big so just spread it around

1124
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,240
but basically these i took a bunch of my

1125
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,359
favorite objects

1126
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,599
um a lot of them are ui objects like

1127
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,960
this this color picker

1128
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,599
down here um it's still an object it

1129
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,440
still just has inlets and outlets but

1130
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
they they provide some cool ui to help

1131
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,760
you produce interesting data with it

1132
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,359
um so i'm going to give everyone like

1133
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,520
five minutes i'll try to answer as many

1134
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,079
uh as many questions as i can but for

1135
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,800
now just uh keep this patch locked and

1136
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,040
and play around and when you're ready

1137
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,839
unlock it

1138
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,599
and and you can start to you know you

1139
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,480
can connect all of these things together

1140
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,640
um and and see you know and see what

1141
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,079
happens um

1142
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,560
i especially love this one called drunk

1143
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,280
i highly recommend playing around

1144
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,200
with that you get some you get some fun

1145
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,520
stuff

1146
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,359
yeah so uh yeah play around ask ask

1147
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,119
questions

1148
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,240
um and i will answer them

1149
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,640
is there something like a patch

1150
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,079
repository

1151
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,839
yes but i can't link you directly to it

1152
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:10,400
because i

1153
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,040
i i don't really use it i don't there's

1154
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,079
there's definitely there's like a

1155
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:14,560
there's like

1156
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,079
max has like its own little app store

1157
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,640
now if you go into package manager

1158
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,960
um yeah there's a lot of cool stuff that

1159
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,000
people people put this

1160
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,839
people add things in here all the time

1161
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,480
um and then

1162
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,520
there's definitely stuff you can

1163
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,599
download online separately and

1164
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,160
uh or the objects the object menu over

1165
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,480
here has everything in it

1166
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,240
are there graphs yes there are graphs um

1167
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,599
i don't think i have any in this demo

1168
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,119
but like the closest thing i have is

1169
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:41,440
this

1170
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,359
uh this color picker i think uh

1171
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,520
which yeah also i rigged to obnoxiously

1172
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,880
change the color of the

1173
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,440
of the patch uh so ultimately these can

1174
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,520
be saved to canned applications i think

1175
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,560
i may be missing

1176
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,280
what max is intended for exactly so most

1177
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,440
people use macs as far as i know

1178
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,480
um for for for installation work

1179
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,880
um so you know you put macs on like a

1180
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,079
mac mini or something

1181
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,720
and if you have some interactive exhibit

1182
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,240
or a display or something it just kind

1183
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,200
of lives there and runs

1184
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,240
but but but but you can

1185
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,359
absolutely uh export your your

1186
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,880
patches as a standalone application um

1187
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,200
it'll bundle the mac's runtime in with

1188
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,960
it and you can upload it i know you can

1189
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,040
upload them to the the mac app store or

1190
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,920
you can you can

1191
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,000
you know host them wherever you want and

1192
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,680
they'll be downloadable by anyone even

1193
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,079
if they

1194
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,280
don't have macs installed um people can

1195
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,000
download your

1196
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,680
your program and use it as a standalone

1197
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,760
application which is a really

1198
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,960
i think a really powerful feature

1199
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,400
can you read extensions for macs and

1200
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,079
something like python i don't know if

1201
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,040
python is supported but yes you can do

1202
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,119
um you can write in c javascript java

1203
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,680
um and with javascript they actually

1204
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,319
have a

1205
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,000
um node.js built like it's built in

1206
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,079
and that's actually how i built the the

1207
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,920
twitch plays max thing

1208
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,640
um you could you you can run node as as

1209
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,240
an object within

1210
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,000
uh within your within your patcher but

1211
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,599
yeah they have they have specific

1212
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,720
objects for for java javascript

1213
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,119
see you can even do signal processing

1214
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,160
with with those which is

1215
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,760
which is really neat like you can just

1216
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,440
write a little chunk of signal

1217
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,800
processing in c

1218
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,960
and and save it as an object on your on

1219
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,960
your patcher

1220
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,800
uh oh i'm sorry to hear about getting

1221
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,079
laid off but hopefully

1222
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,359
hopefully you get another job where

1223
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,200
where it would be a perfect fit yeah

1224
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,280
kiosk stuff that's that's like exactly

1225
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,839
exactly

1226
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,240
like strike zone can comments be linked

1227
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,960
to the object

1228
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,720
they refer to or are they just dumb

1229
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,640
bubbled dumb bubbles yes you can totally

1230
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,240
link them i got lazy

1231
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,319
to link to link objects together you

1232
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,359
just select

1233
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,280
multiple ones right click

1234
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,920
and group group objects and that'll keep

1235
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,440
them together as you drag them around

1236
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,680
there was a question earlier that may

1237
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,839
have been lost about how well

1238
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,160
patchers play with git or version

1239
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,520
control in general i would guess

1240
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,440
yes good question so i actually have

1241
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,640
this i have my

1242
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,920
my repo up with this project um

1243
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,520
under the hood i think it's just i think

1244
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,599
these are just json files

1245
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,960
so i don't know like you can definitely

1246
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,599
use git

1247
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,319
i don't know how i've never done i've

1248
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,079
never done any kind of like merging

1249
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,359
so i don't know what happens if people

1250
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,520
branch and try to try to combine

1251
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,800
i imagine it might be kind of ugly but

1252
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,480
uh at the end of the day under the hood

1253
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,720
it's all just text-based files so

1254
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,240
um there's there is that yeah i cracked

1255
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,119
open

1256
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,880
um your twitch plays or one of the

1257
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,240
random files in there that is a

1258
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,160
max patch and you're right it's just

1259
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,920
json it's just json yeah

1260
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,200
it's pretty it's pretty readable too if

1261
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,640
i remember it just like tells you the

1262
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,000
name of the object and like where

1263
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
in the patcher it is so maybe i don't

1264
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,440
know maybe mergers wouldn't be that bad

1265
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,720
and and i take that back

1266
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,440
any limitation how big a project can be

1267
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,520
number of objects uh

1268
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,680
i haven't hit it yet i i i recommend you

1269
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,800
google like google image search uh

1270
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,920
max patch and just see like

1271
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,200
the absolute crazy stuff that people

1272
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,720
people put out there um i i think what

1273
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,040
what

1274
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,880
what draws me to max and i i think

1275
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,319
others too um

1276
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,400
is because it's so simple it's just

1277
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,839
objects and wires

1278
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,800
you can you can program things in a way

1279
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,640
that may not be efficient but make sense

1280
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,079
to your brain

1281
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,440
and um and sometimes you get a glimpse

1282
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,200
into people's brains and it's just like

1283
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,319
i wish i wish i never

1284
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,240
i never saw that

1285
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,319
what will a max runtime can project run

1286
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,000
on are raspberry pi and other linux

1287
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,440
distro is supported

1288
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,319
uh no that's so pure data that's what

1289
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,440
you're looking for if you want to run on

1290
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,560
a raspberry pi

1291
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,440
um that that will it's the same thing

1292
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,000
you can still

1293
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
you can still bundle it up as a as i

1294
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,280
don't know if it's an executable but you

1295
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,480
can bundle it up in some

1296
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,839
some way and absolutely run it uh run it

1297
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,880
how does max handle order of operations

1298
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,359
multiple objects operating in parallel

1299
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:18,640
good question

1300
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,160
um i think the only time you really have

1301
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,319
to consider timing is when you have

1302
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,280
multiple outlets or you have an outlet

1303
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,200
sending data out of multiple

1304
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,720
patch cables and i'm 90 sure

1305
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,599
the data will go through the patch cable

1306
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,359
on the right

1307
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,319
first and then the left it should be

1308
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,079
effectively instant but i i

1309
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,480
it is there is a timing aspect and which

1310
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,839
is crazy because if you just like

1311
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,839
rearrange where how your patch looks

1312
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,280
you could actually affect the behavior

1313
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,480
which is not not ideal

1314
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,640
yeah yikes yikes indeed um yeah

1315
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,200
how did the conversion oh go ahead how

1316
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,040
do the conversion pathways look like

1317
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,440
or how do they look between uh max and

1318
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,599
pure data

1319
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,079
uh i i don't have a great answer i i to

1320
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,599
be honest i wish i was i wish i was

1321
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,880
cooler and use pure data more but

1322
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,240
yeah i can't give you a good answer

1323
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,479
there

1324
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,520
why does the screen go blank when you

1325
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,280
choose presentation mode another awesome

1326
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:23,839
question

1327
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,680
uh because you have to explicitly add

1328
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,160
add objects to a presentation

1329
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,400
and so if you right click on an object

1330
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,920
uh

1331
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,800
add to presentation is an option and

1332
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,119
then when you go into presentation mode

1333
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,640
that'll show up all right um i want to

1334
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,920
demo some other stuff we've got about 10

1335
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,040
minutes left

1336
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,040
um yeah what's most but we talked about

1337
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,720
sound let's do video quick i think this

1338
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,440
one's really fun

1339
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,240
um and if you follow me on twitter i i

1340
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,640
made a stupid post about this um so this

1341
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,119
patch

1342
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,560
what it does is it takes some video

1343
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,440
input um it finds it tries to find a

1344
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,440
chunk of the color red

1345
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,400
and it will track that in your screen

1346
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,680
and it will give you

1347
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,839
an estimate of where it thinks the red

1348
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,520
the red is so i'm gonna just open my

1349
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,440
camera here

1350
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,240
open i'm gonna start it up i should see

1351
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,040
my camera hopefully

1352
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:25,839
maybe uh

1353
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,319
we don't like it today it's possible

1354
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,480
it's being consumed by

1355
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,319
uh zoom yeah you know i tried it

1356
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,319
yesterday and it worked um

1357
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,559
whatever uh if you go to my twitter i

1358
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:39,920
show you i show a demo where

1359
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,040
i'm actually using a sign to execute key

1360
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,760
commands

1361
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,839
so i i when when i pick when i detect

1362
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:46,880
the color red

1363
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,880
in the middle of the screen then i

1364
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,800
instruct max to simulate a bus

1365
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,480
a button press which which you know

1366
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,640
would mute my would be my camera

1367
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,000
i'm bum this isn't working i don't know

1368
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,119
what i don't know what happened here let

1369
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:06,160
me close

1370
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,000
yeah oh wait i think it is it might

1371
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,480
actually be working

1372
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,880
no all right i had my red robot already

1373
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,920
and everything

1374
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,359
all right moving on that's the first

1375
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,319
first demo fail that's fine

1376
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,880
um networking i think is a good thing to

1377
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,839
talk about

1378
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,000
um so if you want to deal with the

1379
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,520
internet or if you want to just deal

1380
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,240
with

1381
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,680
if you want to have macs running on

1382
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,240
different machines on a network

1383
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,240
you can build like you could try to

1384
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,760
build like multiplayer games and stuff

1385
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,200
there's this great object that's just

1386
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,520
called

1387
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:43,040
net.maxhole um and this is when you see

1388
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,200
mxj that means it's using java under the

1389
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,680
hood

1390
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,200
so if you don't have java under

1391
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,319
installed this this might not work but

1392
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,040
maxhole is the object and it's its

1393
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,599
entire job is to just take some data

1394
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,240
and spit it out to every other max hole

1395
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,559
on your wi-fi network

1396
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,599
so if you have another computer running

1397
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,599
uh which you may or may not just trust

1398
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,280
me that when you if you open this patch

1399
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,559
in two different places on the same

1400
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:09,119
network

1401
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,599
and you send something in it will show

1402
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,240
up

1403
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,319
on it'll show up everywhere so it's like

1404
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,440
no configuration

1405
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,359
it just it just finds its way where it

1406
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:18,720
needs to go

1407
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,079
um i've i've found that to be handy

1408
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,079
um other objects so the max url this

1409
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:26,720
just makes

1410
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,960
web requests if you if you you know if

1411
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,240
you're familiar with

1412
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,440
um http requests so

1413
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,359
i i've used this for for internet of

1414
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:36,480
things

1415
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,160
things right you can you can make a web

1416
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,680
request on your local network to turn

1417
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,480
off your lamp

1418
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,280
or you can use um if this then that web

1419
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,160
hooks

1420
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,960
to to uh to turn off your other lamp or

1421
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,319
whatever the hell else you have hooked

1422
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,680
up to if this than that

1423
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,440
um but yeah you just you just pass it a

1424
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,040
url and

1425
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,960
it will it'll fetch it and it'll give

1426
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,319
you the output down here

1427
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,839
um cool

1428
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,280
it worked when i turned off zoom camera

1429
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,920
all right good to know

1430
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,160
i don't seem to have an outlet yeah so

1431
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,520
the max hole if you don't have an out

1432
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,359
outlet on the maxwell object that means

1433
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,920
that that java is not configured

1434
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,400
correctly um so you need to have java 8

1435
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,680
installed

1436
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,960
um and i i have a link elsewhere if you

1437
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,400
go to the hackaday io page there's a

1438
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,240
link for for how to install that

1439
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,520
um there might be some other

1440
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,040
configuration issues with java but if

1441
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,800
you don't see an outlet that that means

1442
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,839
it couldn't actually load that object so

1443
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,920
sorry about that um

1444
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,079
let's do it's a keyboard output this

1445
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,040
one's really fun

1446
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,440
you can have max drive your computer

1447
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,720
this is very dangerous

1448
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,920
you have to give accessibility

1449
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,720
permission uh you could accidentally

1450
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,880
delete something or as i say email your

1451
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,240
boss whatever um

1452
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,839
so i'm gonna i'm gonna demo this i'll

1453
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,680
demo this in the chat here uh but

1454
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,960
basically

1455
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,760
i'm gonna connect the the the outlet

1456
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,960
here

1457
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,240
to the inlet of what's called autobot um

1458
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,319
and it will type as me the the message

1459
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,559
fun but dangerous after eight seconds

1460
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,599
so i'm gonna click this i'm gonna go

1461
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:23,839
quickly to the to the chat

1462
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:37,599
maybe it didn't work

1463
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,040
all right maybe demo fail number two

1464
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,359
text file baby yeah

1465
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,119
i don't know you get the idea it's it's

1466
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,920
for the best to be honest uh this is

1467
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,920
this is this is dangerous uh it's it's

1468
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,200
again it's using your accessibility

1469
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:55,760
settings

1470
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,359
if you're familiar with the java robot

1471
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,160
library which uh any of my co-workers my

1472
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,680
current co-workers on here

1473
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,520
uh will be uh that's what it's using

1474
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,040
under the hood so it's it's a pretty

1475
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,200
standard way of of controlling your uh

1476
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,440
of your computer um

1477
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,559
yeah cool um

1478
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,240
all right i have just a few minutes left

1479
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,079
uh so i want to talk about midi

1480
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,000
io and arduino io this is hackaday we

1481
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,400
like hardware um

1482
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,800
so midi if you don't know midi is is a

1483
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,559
is a way to control it's mostly used for

1484
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:26,960
for

1485
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,760
musical instruments or or you know

1486
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,079
controllers for musical instruments

1487
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,599
i'm here to tell you you can use midi

1488
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,280
for any damn thing you want to

1489
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,280
i think it's a great protocol to use if

1490
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,559
you're just to get

1491
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,240
if you want to get controllers buttons

1492
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,319
or whatever sending data

1493
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,920
uh just use me even if your your

1494
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,680
application has nothing to do with with

1495
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,319
uh with music just use midi it's great

1496
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,400
um so i have a midi controller plugged

1497
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,839
into my computer here

1498
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,800
and you can see as i turn the knob um

1499
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,119
the

1500
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,520
value of this knob shows up with the

1501
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,040
this is called the control in

1502
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,920
object and i didn't have to configure

1503
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,240
that

1504
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,160
you literally you just you just open the

1505
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,000
control in object and it will just pick

1506
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,240
up

1507
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,880
all your midi devices and start spitting

1508
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,000
out data immediately

1509
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,520
so i could i could i don't have time but

1510
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,559
i could drive the bird with this uh

1511
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,119
with this controller um and then if

1512
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,800
you're using arduino and you wanna if

1513
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,160
you using arduino and you don't wanna

1514
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,760
use my little midi hack where you just

1515
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,680
use midi for for all types of

1516
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,880
communication you can use serial

1517
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,480
serial connection so that's just over

1518
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,079
usb um

1519
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,599
i won't get into much detail here if

1520
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:34,800
you're if you're pretty used to using

1521
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,079
arduino i hope you're used to using

1522
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:36,880
serial

1523
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,280
uh you know data comes in the inlet that

1524
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,960
gets sent to the arduino anything that

1525
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,400
comes out of the outlet

1526
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,599
is received from the arduino um

1527
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,680
yeah it's there for you it's ready to go

1528
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,800
uh

1529
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,559
definitely dig into the help for this

1530
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,040
one they have it's it's pretty uh

1531
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,319
pretty heavy duty

1532
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,440
it's heavy duty enough where it's

1533
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,680
actually going to beachball me yeah um

1534
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,400
yeah scary stuff but if you know what

1535
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:02,880
you're doing

1536
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,480
it's super powerful uh yes you do need

1537
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,839
to add fields for that

1538
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:15,920
i feel pretty good about what we covered

1539
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,000
here today uh i i hope

1540
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,839
i hope again take away i i don't i don't

1541
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,680
expect you to to understand what

1542
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,200
any of these things are doing but i hope

1543
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,119
again the main takeaway is it doesn't

1544
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:25,680
matter

1545
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,920
just copy and paste it and as you get

1546
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,880
more comfortable as

1547
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,280
as you as you get things working um you

1548
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,960
know that's when you open that the help

1549
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,559
that's when you open the inspector

1550
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,160
that's when you google it and you you

1551
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,799
can dive in um so you start as high

1552
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,480
level as you want just just take

1553
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,319
objects and and play around with them

1554
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:43,839
and and you know

1555
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,000
as you as you get comfortable just get

1556
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,599
you can go deeper and deeper and deeper

1557
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,599
until you're you're just writing c code

1558
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,200
um and

1559
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,640
and then you just get out of max once

1560
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,440
you've hit that point um

1561
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,599
yeah uh and as one last flex since it's

1562
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,040
hackaday i'm going to show you i

1563
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,280
i if you're a hardware person i don't

1564
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,400
know hopefully

1565
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,839
this is not just all my friends on this

1566
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:06,000
call um i actually modeled

1567
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,040
a a shift register uh using just like

1568
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,640
native max objects

1569
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,599
um so basically i'll start it up

1570
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,640
um and if you if you

1571
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,400
if you dive into the shift register

1572
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,839
object here you'll see

1573
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,079
i'm actually modeling the flip flops and

1574
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,440
if you dive into those

1575
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,240
i have the down to the nand gates um and

1576
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,280
so that's that's another thing i love

1577
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,319
about macs is it's

1578
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,520
it's a way to to to program and to do

1579
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,280
things virtually but it feels

1580
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,480
it feels kind of like working with

1581
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,480
hardware um

1582
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,079
in a lot of ways you know just by the

1583
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,240
the kind of asynchronous nature

1584
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,200
and and you know inlets outlets and and

1585
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,720
wires like it's kind of it's kind of

1586
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,160
hard wary so

1587
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,920
um yeah that's all i got

1588
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:03,119
great well thank you very much guys
