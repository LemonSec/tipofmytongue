2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,359
hey everyone thanks for joining in

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,280
it's a fun evening for me in mumbai

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,400
everyone's here let's get started

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,640
the whole idea behind this started uh a

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,160
couple of months ago

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,320
when the lockdown started and i was

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,000
trying to see how i can make my

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,199
uh pcb renders look better

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,160
now let me share my screen straight away

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,800
so

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,160
i can show you what's happening desktop

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,398
sure

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,320
that works elliot

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,960
looks good all right okay so

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,079
uh here's a simple uh badge

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,320
that i made for the hackaday uh series i

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,000
made on hackaday u

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,360
uh for okay and freecad and uh

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,840
that's the

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
that's the pcb let me see if we can move

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,000
the window around and table

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,320
stuff

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,360
and uh that's the

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,720
3d view so as you can see i mean kiket

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,400
does a fairly good job with

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
uh with rendering but

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,920
this is the standard view and if i click

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,159
on render it goes into render mode

30
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,680
it takes a while so i'm going to skip

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
that right now

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,320
but if you look at

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,840
retracing preferences

34
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,640
no this doesn't have

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,040
but with the new nike version there's

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,079
some couple of more

37
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,479
features which i'll show you but in the

38
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,920
earlier versions

39
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,840
this is all you could do you could click

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,520
on the render button

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,600
and get a render there was no way to

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,280
change the lighting

43
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
or probably you know put a different

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,319
background for example and so on

45
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,280
so those are a couple of limitations but

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,400
if we look at

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,560
the

48
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,120
current likely let me

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,239
get that i'm going to show you what uh

50
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,280
the nightly does now so

51
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,959
uh the

52
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,310
nightly if you do the

53
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,239
[Music]

54
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,800
3d view

55
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,480
things get better because when you go to

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,640
display options you have a retracing tab

57
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,599
in which you can add a couple of more

58
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,800
options like

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,879
shadows and reflections and you can do

60
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,680
lights and so on so

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,959
it gets better but even so not a lot of

62
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,760
control

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,040
so this is why i thought of you know

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,159
seeing if i can use

65
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,840
blender i've been trying to use to learn

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,800
blender for almost five years now and

67
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,599
every time

68
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,640
i started off i'd look at a cube like

69
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,360
this with

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,879
some really busy user interface and i

71
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,480
just wouldn't know where to start with

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
right click left click wouldn't do much

73
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,920
i didn't even know how to move the damn

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,360
cube so

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,879
it was very frustrating until i

76
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,400
came across uh this guy linda guru

77
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,959
he is uh awesome he is funny which is

78
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,599
what makes

79
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,879
uh sitting through his tutorials

80
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,720
so manageable so big shout out to him i

81
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,840
did his beginner tutorial of getting

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,760
from

83
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,599
getting to the donut and

84
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:01,480
this is what i got to

85
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,480
is

86
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,040
okay so i started off with

87
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,720
this this was the first blend that i did

88
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,239
so something

89
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,079
a donut that looked like chalk and then

90
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,120
i progressed through his tutorials and

91
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,600
uh sort of finally released here which

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,240
is

93
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,280
pretty like you can eat it i guess

94
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,520
so it was pretty amazing i started

95
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,320
playing with

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,960
the open hardware badge that i was

97
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
helping design at that time with the

98
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,000
mechanical uh assembly and so on so this

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,199
was my first

100
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,639
pcb render in in blender

101
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,800
and everything was very metallic not

102
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,400
very good but

103
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,040
eventually over a couple of weeks i

104
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
figured out how to play around with the

105
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,600
background

106
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,560
the lighting changed the color of the

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,840
various layers from the pcb and

108
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,280
add some let's say here's a nice one

109
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,880
okay this one i was pretty proud of

110
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
because i got the flex cable

111
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,759
pretty bang on over here the color the

112
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,880
transparency and soft so

113
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,680
that's what i went through and then i

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,479
did the

115
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,479
hackaday you course for kaicah and

116
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,840
freecad

117
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,120
so i took that pcb as a starting point

118
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,680
for

119
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,199
today's uh workshop and i thought let me

120
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,560
show you how we can progress to getting

121
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
uh something like yeah so you can add

122
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,199
really great you know

123
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,520
let's see backgrounds and lighting and

124
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,960
stuff like that

125
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,880
so we're trying to go and get to there

126
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,440
so first things first let's just see

127
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,080
what

128
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,600
we can do in kaiken

129
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
itself so

130
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
let me

131
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,400
open up what you would normally see with

132
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,319
regular

133
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,800
okay which is

134
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,840
this one

135
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,400
so if you look at the standard render

136
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,360
from

137
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,080
kcat you'll notice that the footprints

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
don't have any distinguishing

139
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
features like the resistors is just a

140
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,960
brown

141
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,639
cylinder the dip ics don't have any

142
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,520
you know identification marks on them

143
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,600
like the part number and so on

144
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,240
same with the

145
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,520
regulator capacitors as well they're

146
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,199
just kind of blank

147
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,400
shells and so on so not just not

148
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,599
something that

149
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,840
gives you some realistic uh appearance

150
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,120
but you can get to this

151
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,919
within packard itself let me show you

152
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,599
the other one

153
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,599
which is here

154
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,759
so this was done

155
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,280
using freecad

156
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,080
so what i've added here is you'll notice

157
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,560
the

158
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
part number on the logo and the 80 tiny

159
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,080
i've added color bands for the resistors

160
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,840
same for the voltage regulator the

161
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,080
capacitors have values on them this

162
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,880
one's

163
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,000
470 micro it's 100 nano

164
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and so on and then i change the color of

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,319
the button

166
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,840
and the rgb leds have a

167
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,120
transparent layer with the

168
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,199
dye is visible inside and so on so these

169
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
are things you can do

170
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,879
within uh let's say the kaicad freak

171
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,440
head

172
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,319
domain itself let me very quickly

173
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,919
show you how you can

174
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,560
do that

175
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,800
which okay here's my freaking so

176
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:27,840
for example

177
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,400
here's the

178
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
dip

179
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
okay

180
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,959
so the way this works is

181
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,240
you use the uh kaicat step up tools

182
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,160
workbench and if that's something that

183
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,240
you haven't used i highly recommend it

184
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,720
because

185
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,680
that's what allows

186
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,560
super integration between kaiken and

187
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,279
freecad

188
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,120
it's over here

189
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,040
looks kind of busy but not very

190
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,279
difficult to use what it does is it lets

191
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,080
you take a

192
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,200
step uh footprint uh

193
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,640
lets you import the footprint

194
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,040
symbol from kaiket and then lets you

195
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,279
align both of them with each other

196
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,080
and then after that when you export it

197
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,959
it

198
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,360
creates a pair of files one of them is

199
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,800
an erml format

200
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,600
the other one is in step format and then

201
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,360
you can use uh vrml

202
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,120
for the kicad renders and the step files

203
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,160
are used for

204
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
let's say freecad import so it's really

205
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,480
a great way of

206
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,200
getting nice renders and good mechanical

207
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,640
cad

208
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,680
workflow as well so

209
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,360
this one i started off with

210
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,079
let me hide the footprint

211
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,560
so this is what comes standard with uh

212
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,040
kycad

213
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,839
and what i did for this was

214
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,680
create a couple of

215
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,240
extrudes like this for example the atmel

216
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,720
logo

217
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,360
was imported as an svg i just found it

218
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,320
off the

219
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,400
atmel website and i took the

220
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,120
[Music]

221
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,160
svg imported it in free cad

222
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,480
made it into a solid by extruding it and

223
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,279
then

224
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,120
placed it ever so slightly

225
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,079
under the surface

226
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,279
of the chip like so to show you the

227
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,720
wireframe so there's just a very small

228
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,320
amount of interference over there and

229
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,079
then i did a boolean cut between the

230
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:18,560
text

231
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,760
and the ic that lets you

232
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,839
get the desired

233
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,200
result which is let me

234
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
go to shading

235
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,560
like so and then let me

236
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,800
unhide all of this uh hide the stuff

237
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,599
that i don't need

238
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,920
like so so it's a little bit of

239
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,040
preparation

240
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,399
but should be fairly easy once you

241
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,079
get used to the workflow with uh

242
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,160
something like let's say show you

243
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,279
another one very quickly

244
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,760
okay resistor so this one was

245
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,959
fairly straightforward the

246
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,800
the only thing you need to do is

247
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,959
create a sketch

248
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,160
create a sketch with the four bands that

249
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,920
you want to use for the

250
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,360
uh fork for colors and

251
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,560
revolve it around the body of the

252
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,839
[Music]

253
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,040
resistor and then when you export it

254
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,000
using the

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,440
kitecatch step up tools workbench it

256
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,360
asks you for the colors you want to

257
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,120
assign to each of these

258
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,519
different colors that it sees here so

259
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,600
that way you can use the same model to

260
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,040
generate let's say 1k

261
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,560
or 10k or 4.7 k so depending on what you

262
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,440
need so

263
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
uh i'm sure this can be also be done

264
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,959
by some kind of a python script for

265
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,519
example i'm not a programmer so if

266
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,600
someone of you can figure it out should

267
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
be pretty easy to

268
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,959
create a whole bunch of resistors

269
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,160
and you could do probably the same with

270
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,680
let's say smb chip resistors and

271
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,519
capacitors

272
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,920
capacitors are a bit of a tricky

273
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,200
workflow to get that because you need to

274
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,000
have

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,600
text on a curved surface and like so

276
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,639
so it's it's possible and doable

277
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,480
but something that i can't cover for

278
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,560
today maybe i'll add a separate uh post

279
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,480
on how you can achieve this but

280
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,399
freecad has a couple of ways of

281
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,839
achieving uh

282
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,120
projecting curved text on the surface

283
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,120
so once you have this you can probably

284
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
start changing the text

285
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,120
and exporting the models for all the

286
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,560
various values that you have

287
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,880
so there is some amount of work required

288
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,760
but then

289
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,240
you nothing was easy ever so

290
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,000
so using this whole set of techniques

291
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,040
you can

292
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,279
achieve what could be called as a

293
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,639
fairly decent let's say

294
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
render output from kai ked itself and if

295
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,480
that works for you great you don't have

296
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,600
to go to blender

297
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,199
but if you want something even really

298
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,279
better then blender is

299
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,560
definitely available so um

300
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,600
let's get started with blender i'm not

301
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
sure if everyone here has

302
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,959
uh kind of used blender before but i

303
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,680
will assume

304
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,760
that everyone here is the first time

305
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,959
user so

306
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,560
i'll try and cover uh

307
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,079
only the things that we need to get to

308
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,480
realistic pcbs there is a lot blender

309
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,440
can do a lot

310
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,160
just like freaking you can do animation

311
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,120
and you can do

312
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,399
all kinds of custom sculpting and so on

313
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,120
so

314
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
it is a lot of different things for

315
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,240
different people depending on what

316
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,440
you're

317
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,720
trying to achieve and that complicates

318
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,000
matters because they're just

319
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,639
too many things to be learned i noticed

320
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,120
that

321
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,040
when i got uh where is it blender guru's

322
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,079
cheat sheet on uh

323
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,120
blender it turned out to be some nine

324
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,160
pages long that's just the shortcuts

325
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,440
so it's like kind of overwhelming to

326
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,040
remember all of this so it's handy to

327
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,959
have a sheet but it's difficult to

328
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,720
even locate the stuff that you need to

329
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,519
locate within this

330
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
blender is kind of not for the

331
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,680
faint-hearted like i said i have been

332
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,120
trying to

333
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,040
use it for the last five years and every

334
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
year every time i look at the

335
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,160
cube and kind of get uh get put off with

336
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,199
it

337
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,040
so first things first i will make sure

338
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,680
that my key strokes and mouse keys can

339
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,839
be seen so i'm going to press the

340
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,959
n key that brings up this little tab

341
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,639
the window over here and

342
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,519
under screen keys i can then screencast

343
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,880
and okay

344
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,839
so great so you can see hopefully the

345
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,160
mouse keys over here

346
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,800
and i have a little document here that

347
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,880
i've opened up to make sure that i don't

348
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,639
miss anything so i'm going to keep

349
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,720
referring to that so i'll cover the

350
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,600
pre-preparation

351
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,399
part blender okay orbit

352
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,399
a blender doesn't really work very well

353
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,120
if you have

354
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,240
a laptop keyboard because

355
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,639
it needs i mean it works best if you

356
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,320
have a dedicated keyboard with

357
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,000
uh the number keys and

358
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,560
so on you can somehow get by on your

359
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,079
laptop as i've been doing

360
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,360
but it's kind of much faster with

361
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,839
regular full-sized keyboard anyway

362
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,880
the first action is to move around and

363
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
look at this cube and that is done by

364
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
pressing the middle mouse button

365
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,280
and keeping it pressed and as you hold

366
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,119
it you can kind of you know

367
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,400
move around and orbit around your object

368
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,079
so that that's looking around

369
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,400
if you press shift and middle mouse

370
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,319
button you can kind of pan

371
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,679
around your view and then if you

372
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,679
use the scroll wheel you can zoom in and

373
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,600
out so that's the three basic

374
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,679
functions little mouse button shift

375
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,120
middle mouse button

376
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,559
and scroll wheel so

377
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,840
that's moving

378
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,240
also you will notice on the left there's

379
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,080
a couple of

380
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,320
toolbar icons available the first one is

381
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,520
just the

382
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,919
uh the mouse pointer so that lets you

383
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,000
select objects like that's the cube

384
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,320
here's the camera here's the light and

385
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,520
so on

386
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,880
but the other ones let you move uh

387
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
objects so here's the move button click

388
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,320
on the object

389
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,679
and you get the three axis uh arrows

390
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,080
you can pull on one of them and you can

391
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,760
move the cube

392
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,000
if you press control it snaps to the

393
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,440
unit increments

394
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,640
and if you do a control shift

395
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,520
and move it snaps to a tenth of those

396
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,320
increments

397
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,440
so that's how you can move things around

398
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,840
oh that's one axis there's the other

399
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,640
axis

400
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
is the third axis and so on so

401
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,840
let's uh move this rotate which

402
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,280
brings up these three colored uh

403
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,799
circles that lets you move in those

404
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,000
axes x y and

405
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,760
z or if you choose the white circle you

406
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,880
can do a free spin in any direction

407
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,400
so let's rotate

408
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,600
and then there's a scale

409
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
and again the same thing you get three

410
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
axes and a white one the white one

411
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,880
scales uniformly

412
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,080
or the other ones

413
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,520
scale along those axes for example

414
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,679
so that's scaling you can get the same

415
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,200
thing with

416
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,760
shortcut keys g for grab

417
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,720
and

418
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,960
so g grabs and moves your object for

419
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,400
example

420
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,840
s scales it and r

421
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,480
rotates it

422
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,600
those are the shortcuts for kind of

423
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,200
moving around

424
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,120
the workspace over here

425
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,160
let's see if i have a cover

426
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,760
okay next up i'd like to introduce you

427
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,000
to

428
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,039
the uh the collection tree which is uh

429
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,280
what you see out here at the top

430
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,880
right hand corner there is one

431
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,360
collection right now which contains a

432
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,159
camera

433
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,480
that's highlighted here and there's a

434
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,720
cube in the middle

435
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,000
and then there's a light over here so

436
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,200
these are the three things

437
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,960
in this collection and you can add more

438
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
collections as you build your scene for

439
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,400
example

440
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,120
and over here are the various properties

441
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,000
tabs that

442
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,559
we will be using a lot some of these

443
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,000
settings we need to do

444
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,400
prior to getting any further so

445
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,960
i'll try and walk you through those uh

446
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,320
in a bit

447
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,880
that's one thing the other is the

448
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
different kinds of modes of

449
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,240
viewing that you get what we are in now

450
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,159
is known as the solid view which means

451
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,440
you just see this

452
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
solid and that's it but you can also go

453
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,520
into

454
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,240
material preview like so which

455
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,600
you will notice wouldn't have changed

456
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,520
much except that the cube became

457
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,360
uh white so that's the default color in

458
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,320
blender and then there's the the render

459
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,720
view

460
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,200
which is what your actual output will

461
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,840
look like

462
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,400
when you do rendering so that's your

463
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,520
three views you mostly

464
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,080
work in the solid tree view you can also

465
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,200
do the

466
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,039
the x-ray view which is useful when you

467
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,120
want to select everything like so

468
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,480
including the

469
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,840
uh the vertices and

470
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,280
lines in the background the other thing

471
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,840
to

472
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,080
remember is blender is a mesh based

473
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,520
modeling software so it i mean solids

474
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,799
are hollow on the inside

475
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,760
like with let's say freecad where a step

476
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,240
file is a solid object

477
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,679
so for

478
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,120
for someone coming from a cad

479
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,440
perspective it's not really the easiest

480
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,360
to use because uh setting dimensions and

481
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,000
precise

482
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,559
uh locations and positions isn't all

483
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,280
that

484
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,640
uh straightforward although those who

485
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,960
are really good at blender do manage to

486
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,000
do exceptionally well with that but

487
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,600
if you're new it kind of gets a little

488
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,960
bit tricky and difficult

489
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,039
the other way to move around this object

490
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,120
is use this which is known as the gizmo

491
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,480
that can move around in orbit or you can

492
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,799
press a

493
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,679
and alphabet to get to that axis and so

494
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,200
on

495
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,640
this one is uh zoom you click it keep it

496
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,240
pressed and move your mouse

497
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,360
that lets you zoom same thing with pen

498
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,760
click the hand and move around without

499
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,840
letting go of your mouse and you can

500
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,760
so there's many different ways of moving

501
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,520
the around blender

502
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,919
if you press the tilde key under your

503
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,360
escape you get the

504
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,919
pi menu that lets you select different

505
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,640
uh

506
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,840
view options

507
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,240
so that's a little bit on the basics of

508
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,400
the

509
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,520
user interface of

510
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,520
a blender at the top you'll find a lot

511
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,400
of uh

512
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,120
what i refer to as the equivalent of

513
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,039
workbenches in freak category

514
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,559
so if you're trying to do animation you

515
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,080
have an animation

516
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,320
uh let's say workbench that brings up

517
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,080
related uh let's say tools and

518
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,720
icons and so on and then there's other

519
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,240
things like rendering and

520
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,440
shading and sculpting and so on layout

521
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,559
is what we're going to use

522
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,640
all the time uh

523
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,240
let me refer back to my dock to make

524
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,760
sure that i'm going in the proper

525
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,799
sequence all right let's look at

526
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,480
properties now so at this point

527
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,600
we have the cube and we have a camera

528
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,679
and a light on it and if you look at

529
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,400
the render properties the first setting

530
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,520
that you need to do

531
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,000
is change what's known as the render

532
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
engine traditionally blender used

533
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
heavy but the recommendation is to now

534
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,640
switch to

535
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,559
cycles it's a much better uh

536
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,520
rendering engine the difference is uh av

537
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,799
is

538
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,440
real time so things change immediately

539
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,880
as you move around

540
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,400
but cycles is it renders

541
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,440
it takes time to for things to catch up

542
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,440
but it looks much much better also

543
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,760
uh if you're going to be using blender

544
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,200
heavily you probably need a more

545
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,440
dedicated machine with some kind of gpu

546
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,960
card and so on

547
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,600
i've been able to get along without

548
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,240
anything

549
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,200
extra special just using a regular

550
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,840
little

551
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,080
laptop and it works all right except

552
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,159
sometimes the render time

553
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,440
takes maybe a minute or two if it's not

554
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,039
very complicated

555
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,559
so that's that make sure you set

556
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,320
the render engine to cycles in your

557
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,039
scene properties

558
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
in the output properties

559
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,200
adjust your resolution to match whatever

560
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,880
your screen resolution is

561
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,919
and percentage so if if this is 50

562
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,679
you'll get something that's 540 pixels

563
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,600
uh tall let's say so set

564
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,480
said that also set the color depth of

565
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,120
the

566
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,960
rendered images that you'll be saving i

567
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,640
choose 16 because

568
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,600
there's better outputs of course the

569
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,760
next tab is w layer properties

570
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,159
and over here there's an important

571
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,480
checkbox that needs to be

572
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,559
done and i'll walk you through this a

573
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,520
bit later it's called

574
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,279
denoising data what this does is

575
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,640
uh the cycles rendering engine produces

576
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,440
some noise

577
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,360
artifacts when you do rendering and and

578
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,400
doing denoising uh removes

579
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,720
practically most of that noise and

580
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,240
creates a really really nice

581
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,520
smooth render so we look at uh it needs

582
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,440
another step to make that happen

583
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,480
look at it as we go ahead but

584
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,360
for the moment in the scene in the layer

585
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,039
properties you need to make sure you

586
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,640
enable denoising data and then

587
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,559
on there's the scene properties we can

588
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,919
leave it as it is

589
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,440
but here is a point

590
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,039
to be remembered

591
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,080
one blender unit is

592
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,200
one unit of whatever it is that you are

593
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,679
importing

594
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,960
so uh right now this uh

595
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,000
the default cube that pops up is two

596
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,919
meters cube and the grid you see on the

597
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,080
floor is

598
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,360
one meter by one meter squares so that's

599
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,520
set by this scaling over here you can

600
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,400
choose

601
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,760
to show the length in

602
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,320
either mm or centimeters or meters for

603
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,159
example

604
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,960
but when you try to import an external

605
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,640
object into

606
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,240
blender it just takes one unit of

607
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,600
the object as one blender unit so

608
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,120
if you look at it i won't open it again

609
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,320
but the pcb that

610
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,840
i showed you earlier was 75 mm long and

611
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,600
when i get it into blender it becomes

612
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,120
like 7.5

613
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,399
meters long that's super super massive

614
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,960
so one of the things you have to do is

615
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,880
scale things that you import

616
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,399
into blender but

617
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,880
if you want to just scale things that

618
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,600
are

619
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,440
native to blender so blender objects

620
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,279
like this cube and you can

621
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,640
set up a scale factor by pressing the

622
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,399
n key that brings up this

623
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,679
extra side toolbar i'm not sure what

624
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,480
they

625
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,559
officially call it but in

626
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,399
item scaling you can set it to let's say

627
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,279
0.1 or 0.01 for example and that scales

628
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,240
everything to

629
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,360
like if you set it to 0.01 everything

630
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,600
will

631
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,480
come into millimeters so your default

632
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,440
cube will then be

633
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,120
2 mm instead of 2 meters

634
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,480
but since we are importing a pcb

635
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,440
in vrml format which is a non-blender

636
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,559
object to start with

637
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,799
the settings don't matter so there's no

638
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,918
point in playing around with them

639
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,960
so with that done let's

640
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
get started the first thing that you

641
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,399
need to do is

642
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,440
in kaiken you

643
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,880
need to go to your pcb

644
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,159
editor pcb new

645
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:58,399
let me make sure that i have the

646
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,399
okay this got saved as version six so

647
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,440
let me open the

648
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,080
other one now

649
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,840
okay i'm gonna have to use nikes now

650
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,399
here it is

651
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
this

652
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,440
so you do a file uh export

653
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,640
in a vrml format save it to whatever it

654
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,159
needs to be saved

655
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,919
give your grid units and output units

656
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,120
and so on

657
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,799
and uh well that's it

658
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,960
click on okay and be done with it

659
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,320
the next thing is to

660
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,480
import this vrml in

661
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,640
blender and i swear this wasn't working

662
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,039
until a week ago what would happen was i

663
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,919
would

664
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,480
import the vrml file in blender 2.83

665
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,799
and it would lose all colors what i'd

666
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,799
get is

667
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,720
everything colored like white chalk and

668
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,279
i tried a lot nothing seemed to fix it

669
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:19,760
for

670
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,440
a pretty long time for almost the whole

671
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,120
of last month

672
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,399
and i found two uh

673
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,080
solutions to it one was to use

674
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,440
an online cad conversion service called

675
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,440
cloud dot cad exchanger.com

676
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,120
where you can upload a vrml file

677
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,760
and then convert it into something else

678
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,159
so

679
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,919
for the sake of using in kaicad i

680
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,279
chose obj format

681
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,760
and that would work i would then get

682
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,000
color

683
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,320
features retained during the import

684
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,720
the second way i found out was to

685
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,519
install

686
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,720
a blender 2.79 and

687
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,080
importing the vrml in blender 2.79

688
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,880
would retain the colors i could then

689
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,640
save it as a blend file

690
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,000
and then when i open that in blender

691
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,960
2.83 things would be perfect

692
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,440
the reason for not continuing to use

693
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,679
2.79 was

694
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,320
there have been a lot of changes between

695
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,440
that version and

696
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,519
2.83 and in fact there is uh

697
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,480
the the latest version is 2.9 whatever

698
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,240
nine one or nine zero

699
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,640
and again there are a lot of changes

700
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,880
between 2.83 and 2.9

701
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,840
so since i am still pretty new to

702
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,880
blender i decided to stick to

703
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,080
2.83 2.9 is still too new for me

704
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,039
and there's still not too many demo

705
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,240
videos and tutorials up there

706
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,120
so that is what i was breaking my head

707
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,919
with

708
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,399
for almost last month but now suddenly

709
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,039
it seems

710
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,159
uh it works with lender 2.83

711
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,480
without having to do any of these

712
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,600
conversions

713
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,519
and that is well i wasn't sure how i was

714
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,360
surprised and amazed that it did work

715
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,760
but

716
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
uh i'm happy it does because now you

717
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,039
don't need to do anything except

718
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,080
did i delete the cube okay so let me

719
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,600
just start a new

720
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,000
general one so if this is your

721
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,720
new blend file you just select the cube

722
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,080
and click on delete

723
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,480
and your cube is gone then we do a file

724
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,960
import

725
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,320
dot wrl go to your folder

726
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,200
desktop docs

727
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,039
click here blinky and this is my wrl but

728
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,240
before you click on it

729
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,880
make sure that you choose the proper

730
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,240
transform

731
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,679
direction so you want up to be z

732
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,000
in the positive direction so make sure

733
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,600
your up is selected as z

734
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,960
up and forward is x over that's fine

735
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,480
once you do that click wrl click

736
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,600
import takes a while

737
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,880
because i think this is some 15

738
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,519
megabytes something that's a pretty big

739
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,760
fight

740
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,600
you know make sure that i've gone

741
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,799
through this stuff that needed to be

742
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,039
done

743
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,600
okay

744
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,640
import scale

745
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,960
great

746
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,200
okay here comes

747
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,919
so here's the

748
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,919
the pcb you can see that it's been

749
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,120
populated here

750
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,320
in the collection tree and the first

751
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,040
thing

752
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,639
i want to do right away is make sure

753
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,399
that i put it in a separate collection

754
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,760
so that we can play around with

755
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,639
different shapes over here and to do

756
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,719
that you press

757
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,119
m m for mic select new collection

758
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,199
give it a name gonna call it pcb

759
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,000
and click ok

760
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,760
and everything moves into this new

761
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,240
collection

762
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,199
now if i click the object then click

763
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,359
n to bring out the dimensions you can

764
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,960
see that the

765
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,320
size is 711 mm and

766
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,040
as i mentioned things go crazy with uh

767
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,399
the units

768
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,760
but uh for right now we can actually

769
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,119
even work with that but

770
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,040
let me just show you how we can scale

771
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,359
this whole object to 10 times

772
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,400
one tenth of its size make sure you are

773
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,480
in the x-ray mode so that when you

774
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,720
select everything gets selected

775
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,839
then just drag your mouse select

776
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,359
everything

777
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,880
select the sorry about that scale option

778
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,720
select the white circle and just drag it

779
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,680
a little bit

780
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,000
and and leave it and you'll get this

781
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,720
resize

782
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,280
option here at the bottom and you'll

783
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,800
notice that we are now at

784
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,480
0.9 and this is where you can set

785
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,599
the new values 0.1

786
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,240
0.1 0.1

787
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,000
once you're done just click somewhere

788
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,440
else and

789
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,079
that's your

790
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,520
pcb get out of x-ray mode there it is

791
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,560
we can now move it to somewhere near the

792
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,119
origin

793
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,640
so once again go back to x-ray mode

794
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,440
select all of them press g to move it

795
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,359
and bring it like so near the

796
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,799
origin look at it from the top so i can

797
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,280
make sure i pull it to it's not really

798
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,119
necessary but i like having it near the

799
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,560
origin so things

800
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,720
are easier when you're moving around and

801
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,800
you know walking around it

802
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,839
let's look at it from the

803
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,160
front like so make sure it sits

804
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,520
just about on the seat

805
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,160
the axis there and

806
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,160
straight so we have the board imported

807
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,800
and we have it scaled and as you can

808
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,000
notice it has retained

809
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,520
most of its uh colors

810
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,839
but not everything looks uh all right

811
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,359
now but if you go to

812
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,480
because you're in the solid view but if

813
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,280
you go to

814
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,880
material preview and this is what it

815
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,079
looks like

816
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,280
and if you go to

817
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,920
rendered view this is what it looks like

818
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,960
and this is

819
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,880
in av because if you go to

820
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,560
the same properties you can notice we

821
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,520
are in navy and

822
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,000
as you move around you'll notice it kind

823
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,359
of updates

824
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,000
pretty instantly there is no time lag

825
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,640
but

826
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,440
once you switch to cycles

827
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,440
it takes a while to regenerate and you

828
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,200
know display

829
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,400
everything and it's doing in

830
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,480
takes a while for it to walk through

831
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,320
doing all the 32 samples

832
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,119
that it's showing here on the top left

833
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:09,760
but

834
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,040
it gives a much much better

835
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,320
result the other thing to set is

836
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,440
this tissue which is known as clipping

837
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,200
when you get too close to an object

838
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,920
some part of it gets chopped off so to

839
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,040
do that you

840
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,359
bring up your settings toolbar again by

841
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,800
pressing n

842
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,320
and under view clip start

843
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,599
it's set at 100 mm which is

844
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,160
quite large let's set it to 0.1 mm

845
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,520
that lets you zoom into your pcb quite

846
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,640
closely and nicely

847
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,680
just press n again to hide that

848
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,399
so that's setting the clipping pane

849
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,839
let's see what else

850
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,359
okay the next thing to do

851
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,720
is add a plane underneath

852
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,359
the pcb so that acts as a kind of a

853
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,599
surface on which we can probably put

854
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,560
wood texture or marble texture or

855
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,680
whatever the thing that

856
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,200
we'd like to put and you add

857
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,520
new elements by using shift a that

858
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,800
wait a minute let me make sure i enable

859
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,599
the screencast keys

860
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,760
there so now you can see what keys i'm

861
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,880
pressing

862
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,000
so if i do shift a and

863
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,960
under the mesh options i can choose

864
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,240
plane

865
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,240
that brings up a plane like so

866
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,359
and uh it's uh 2000 meters it's kind of

867
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,320
pretty

868
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,240
huge you don't need something that big

869
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,440
ah 1000 mm one square meter is good

870
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
enough and then just click it once

871
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
somewhere

872
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,320
i click on the selection box

873
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,440
so i now have a plane underneath

874
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,200
the pcb like so

875
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,880
the next thing to do is uh

876
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,640
set your camera and lighting

877
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,400
let's uh let's look at lighting first

878
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,640
that's kind of a little bit easier so if

879
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,160
you expand your collection

880
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,480
the the primary collection you have a

881
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,720
camera and a light over there

882
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,440
if you click on light and then all of

883
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:33,920
these

884
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,359
properties tab look at this little bulb

885
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,160
icon over here that brings you the

886
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,599
properties for the light

887
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,119
you can select between point source or

888
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,400
sunlight like so

889
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,200
ah this is too bright because the sun's

890
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,880
strength is kind of pretty huge

891
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,000
let's tone it down to something like 10

892
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,200
instead of a thousand it's still too

893
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,920
bright

894
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,119
bring it down to four okay that's

895
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,119
reasonable

896
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,920
or or you can set up a spotlight but

897
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,839
then before what spotlight is

898
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,240
too less so let's bring it up to 100

899
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,040
watts

900
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,599
or enough 500 watts

901
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,520
750 i guess 750 looks good

902
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,599
and you can set for the spotlight

903
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,319
the size for example let me show you

904
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,119
so what so this is the cone being cast

905
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,400
by the by the light

906
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,400
right so you can set that by

907
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,880
decreasing the size over here in the

908
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,839
spot shape

909
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,359
selection

910
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,920
oops i hope i'm still connected yeah i

911
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,680
hope so

912
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,359
and i can kind of

913
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,520
make it into a real tight spotlight if i

914
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,560
want to

915
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,079
like reducing the size i can grab

916
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,599
the yellow circle over here and move it

917
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,560
around so let me look at the

918
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,599
front and make sure it's pointed right

919
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,720
yeah it is

920
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,040
and yeah just like any other object you

921
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,160
can move the

922
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,119
light around as well so click on the

923
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,560
light click on your

924
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,160
move icon or g to do that and

925
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,160
you can move it if you use control you

926
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,480
can snap it to

927
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,240
unit uh selections let me bring it down

928
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,479
a bit control so

929
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,119
that's your spotlight

930
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,640
still not falling on our object so we

931
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,520
can move it a bit

932
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,119
like so then

933
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,319
once you zoom in you can see where it is

934
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,440
and a blend lets you select the

935
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,319
what i call as the penumbra of the light

936
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,760
source whether it needs to be

937
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,839
soft or hard like so

938
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,280
again all of these

939
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,240
setting boxes you can just move your

940
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,160
slider that's one way of doing it

941
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,319
the other way is to click on it once and

942
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,760
punch a

943
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,040
value using your keyboard like so or

944
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,359
you can click on it once and if you

945
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,319
press ctrl

946
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,599
you can snap it to nice round figures

947
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,240
like

948
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,359
so 0.5.4 and so

949
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,839
so let's keep it at 0.5 for this

950
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:50,000
so that's how you set a light

951
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,119
you can also set up additional lights

952
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,200
and i'll walk you through that a bit

953
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,280
later

954
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,560
but with the light set let's look at

955
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,000
camera settings now every

956
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,599
rendered image is rendered by

957
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,760
looking through what camera setting you

958
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,640
have made

959
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,359
and the camera is a separate object by

960
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:13,920
itself

961
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,280
that you see over here and

962
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,240
what the camera sees can be accessed by

963
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,160
clicking on this

964
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,200
projector or whatever

965
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,160
camera icon over here this is what your

966
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,000
camera is going to

967
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,200
be looking at and

968
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,599
if you want to change this the easiest

969
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,880
way i found is to first

970
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,720
let me zoom in

971
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,078
and set the

972
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,960
scene as i wanted to be seen in the

973
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,880
camera

974
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,240
by moving panning and

975
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,560
orbiting around it like so zoom in a bit

976
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,520
and then if you click on the view

977
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,040
toolbar here

978
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,440
view align view and then select

979
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,680
align active camera to view so the

980
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,440
camera is going to be moved

981
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,480
over to this location and fit

982
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,520
this scene size so you click on that

983
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,720
and this is what you get

984
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,450
the the

985
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,319
[Music]

986
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,680
rectangle that you see is what the

987
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,919
camera is going to render when you

988
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,480
when you push the render button

989
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,680
so let's do our first render we have the

990
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,040
object imported

991
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,240
we have set a plane underneath it and

992
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,000
we've set up a light that's the three

993
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,160
basic things to do to

994
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,640
render your image pressing f12 will

995
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,240
hopefully bring up and if my computer

996
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,839
behaves well

997
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,440
and things

998
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,599
look good then it's going to take a

999
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,200
while for it to

1000
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,000
you know calculate all of the different

1001
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,079
quadrants that it has to walk through

1002
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:10,960
and

1003
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,880
set up so while it's doing that let me

1004
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,560
see if we can get back over here

1005
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,640
and try and do some other settings over

1006
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,720
here

1007
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,119
once for example once you have set the

1008
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,200
camera like so and if you feel that you

1009
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,480
need to

1010
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,599
do some fine tuning then an easier way

1011
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,920
is to click on the box for the camera

1012
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,319
like so so it's highlighted and then

1013
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,280
press the g

1014
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,280
that lets you move it like any other

1015
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,480
object and

1016
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,560
when you do that you can see that you

1017
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,480
can move your object within the

1018
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,839
camera's frame a little bit like so

1019
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,119
if you'd like to zoom in

1020
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,480
zoom out you double click the sorry

1021
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,680
press g double click

1022
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,040
i always get this wrong

1023
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,359
do that again here's the camera

1024
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,640
click on the camera icon press

1025
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,000
g once then press the

1026
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,280
scroll wheel on the mouse once push it

1027
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,560
down and release it

1028
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,920
and then as you move the mouse

1029
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,960
forward and backward you can zoom in and

1030
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,280
out

1031
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,040
this is slightly tricky but with some

1032
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,119
practice you will probably get to it

1033
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,839
so that's how you kind of move around

1034
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:36,880
and fine tune

1035
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,920
the what what the camera sees you know

1036
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,960
let's see if the

1037
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,599
render is done still a long way to go

1038
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,880
but

1039
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,200
even from what we can see i don't know

1040
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,119
if you folks can notice but you'll see

1041
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,880
there is a lot of noise here in the

1042
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,480
shadow for example

1043
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,880
and that's the noise that's coming which

1044
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,200
we can eliminate using the denoise

1045
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,480
function so let me just cancel this

1046
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,480
render because that's what i wanted to

1047
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,920
show you

1048
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,960
and look at how we can remove

1049
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,920
noise in your renders to do that you

1050
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,640
select

1051
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,880
the compositing

1052
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,240
tab and you won't see much

1053
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,000
until you press the use nodes button

1054
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,640
and when you do that and you zoom in you

1055
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,760
get this

1056
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,800
nodes so these are the layers and that's

1057
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,680
your

1058
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,359
output and what you want to do between

1059
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,319
these two is put the function that

1060
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,240
removes noise from the image

1061
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,280
before it goes to the rendered output

1062
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,800
and you add that by doing again shift a

1063
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,160
as in adding anything in blender

1064
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,559
then hit the search bar and look for

1065
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:51,440
denoising

1066
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,280
here in d e n

1067
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,040
d noise so that gives you the

1068
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,319
noise function drop it here in the

1069
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,599
middle

1070
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,160
and it connects between these two

1071
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,598
other nodes now

1072
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,280
you'll notice that

1073
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,400
the image is connected to image but

1074
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,559
that's not what i want to do i would

1075
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,160
need to go back to

1076
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,000
layout and because i've started a new

1077
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,079
blend file over here i haven't made sure

1078
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,520
my settings

1079
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,559
have been the way they should be

1080
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,920
as mentioned earlier so

1081
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,839
i made sure that i'm in cycles

1082
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,960
and in

1083
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,640
layer i need to make sure that my

1084
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,079
denoising data is

1085
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,119
selected so with that selection done for

1086
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,880
denoising data i can go back to

1087
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,160
compositing

1088
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,400
and you'll notice that a lot more

1089
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,359
options have now

1090
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,319
popped up over here and what we want to

1091
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,520
connect is

1092
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,880
not image to image but noisy image

1093
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,839
to image that's the important change

1094
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:06,559
that happens

1095
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,119
and then you also want to put the

1096
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,800
denoising normal

1097
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,400
and the denoising albedo

1098
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,440
to the denoising function

1099
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,480
and that's it once you're done with this

1100
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,559
you can go back to

1101
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,240
layout tab and uh if we

1102
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,598
now push render

1103
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,680
it's going to start rendering and we'll

1104
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,319
come back here after a while to see the

1105
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,280
progress well we can carry on with uh

1106
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,559
some of the other functions

1107
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,960
that we can do here while it's

1108
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,200
churning churning away let me see that i

1109
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,000
have covered

1110
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,680
everything up until now

1111
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,680
meanwhile if there any questions i'd be

1112
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,480
happy to answer

1113
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,160
i think everyone's been pretty mellow

1114
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,400
but folks if you got some questions

1115
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:09,839
type them in right now yep

1116
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,640
there was one question about whether you

1117
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,760
did uh

1118
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,480
text in freecad or it was imported as

1119
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,160
svg

1120
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,480
for the atmel chip but that was like an

1121
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,000
hour ago

1122
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,640
okay yeah so that was uh done using the

1123
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,119
draft workbench in freecad

1124
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,800
it's pretty straightforward i can

1125
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,559
probably make another separate video for

1126
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,000
it if needed

1127
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,839
later on cool

1128
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,960
okay cool i've done planes and cameras

1129
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,079
out with this camera

1130
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,119
pretty good we are very close to getting

1131
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,960
to a realistic

1132
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,119
app

1133
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,400
okay now uh here's what the rendered out

1134
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,520
yeah go ahead

1135
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,119
our question just came in how to get the

1136
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,240
board centered when importing

1137
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,640
right it it by default imports it at

1138
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,680
the origin so there is something

1139
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,960
i don't know if you can see it here

1140
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,040
there's a little circle white and red

1141
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,800
with the axis crosses

1142
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,880
that's known as the cursor

1143
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,520
so wherever the cursor is that's where

1144
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,240
it places

1145
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,240
a new object that's how blender works

1146
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,800
so if if i click on this cursor option

1147
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,599
zoom out somewhere else place the cursor

1148
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:38,559
here

1149
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,559
and then do a shift add

1150
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,720
add a cube hopefully it should add it

1151
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,559
there but this will be like a two meter

1152
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,760
cube so it's going to be kind of right

1153
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,119
so here it is uh

1154
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,680
yeah but then i'm also trying to render

1155
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,240
so i'm really

1156
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,800
sticking my neck out over here so let's

1157
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,640
see if i can escape that do a control c

1158
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,200
yeah okay thankfully recovered but yeah

1159
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,640
that's how you

1160
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,040
so by default because the cursor is at

1161
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,000
the origin

1162
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,280
when you start a new file then when you

1163
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,280
import anything it goes

1164
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,760
over there but then after you scale it

1165
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,960
it moves away to

1166
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,880
a new location unfortunately i'm not

1167
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,480
sure why but

1168
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,359
it doesn't scale around the cursor for

1169
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,200
some reason

1170
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,800
so you have to kind of kind of

1171
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,880
move it after scaling i need a glass of

1172
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,839
water sorry

1173
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,440
all right let's see where our render is

1174
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,720
okay still working

1175
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
at this point if you look it still is

1176
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,640
pretty noisy because it's going to lay

1177
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,319
out everything

1178
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,520
and and then apply the denoise function

1179
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,480
so we'll get back to it once it's done

1180
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,040
completely

1181
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,200
okay that's a lot of progress i think

1182
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,559
the next thing to do

1183
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,920
is if you're happy with the

1184
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,880
way the pcb looks now then maybe the

1185
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,480
only other thing you need to do is play

1186
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,839
around with the light

1187
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,040
by maybe it's still too harsh right now

1188
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,640
so i click on light

1189
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,079
click on the light properties and

1190
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,400
reduce this to something like 500 watts

1191
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,000
or maybe 350 watts

1192
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,280
that looks more mellow and

1193
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,079
and uh

1194
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,839
the other way is to reduce this let's

1195
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,079
say all the way to 200

1196
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,119
and add that

1197
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,559
what are known as uh spotlight

1198
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,359
and then make a new lighting element

1199
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:04,480
by doing control a oh sorry shift a

1200
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,240
shift a go to light and select the three

1201
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,400
point lights

1202
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,240
once you do that

1203
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,920
it sets up well you can see over here

1204
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,480
the height and the distance and so on

1205
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,040
it's probably too far away keep it at

1206
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,599
one meter

1207
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,599
and there it is so you have these

1208
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,040
uh three

1209
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,920
three point light which is kind of

1210
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,839
giving a more

1211
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,200
let's say even more

1212
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,280
diffused lighting to the rest of the

1213
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,960
scene so we now have

1214
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,920
a spotlight and something that is giving

1215
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,240
spread lighting over there

1216
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,480
and well i'm not exported lighting but

1217
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,599
uh it's

1218
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,680
it's a whole physics field by itself so

1219
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,400
you really want to set your lighting

1220
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,720
very precisely you can do it in blender

1221
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,839
you just need to make sure that you read

1222
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:10,240
up

1223
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,000
on it a lot okay let me just choose the

1224
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,359
solid view so things

1225
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,520
are

1226
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,240
all faster let's see if our render has

1227
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,040
reached uh

1228
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,960
any further it's taking its own sweet

1229
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,839
time it's going to be a big one

1230
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,520
so i'm doing a lot of things right now

1231
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,400
let me shut down freaking

1232
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,119
i don't need it anymore yeah maybe

1233
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,000
because

1234
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,240
video is consuming a lot of my computer

1235
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,280
resources

1236
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,599
so that's right anyway we'll get to that

1237
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,280
all right so the next thing is if you're

1238
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,079
happy with the pcb the way it is

1239
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,119
then a quick way to

1240
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:04,559
make your scene better is apply some

1241
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,799
kind of a texture or color to your

1242
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:10,799
plane so to do that you

1243
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,640
click on the plane somewhere you'll

1244
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,839
notice

1245
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,000
it

1246
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:21,359
a bit so

1247
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,400
i choose the cursor when i click on

1248
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,760
the plane you get a border around it to

1249
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,960
show you that it's selected and

1250
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,599
you then go to the material properties

1251
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,000
tab

1252
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,119
which is over here at the bottom

1253
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,799
and you can have a lot of built-in

1254
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,720
texture but let me show you how to do

1255
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,079
things from scratch you do

1256
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,440
a new click on new that

1257
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,760
brings up or creates a material called

1258
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,400
material.001 you can

1259
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,440
rename it by double clicking over here

1260
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,240
and calling it

1261
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,759
uh plain

1262
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,040
material for example or giving it any

1263
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,440
name whatever

1264
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,799
and it uses what is known as a

1265
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:09,760
principled

1266
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,799
bsdf that's a kind of shader that

1267
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,040
comes with blender don't ask me what the

1268
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,040
bsdf means but

1269
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,880
apparently blender used to come with

1270
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,040
different shaders earlier like if you

1271
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,799
wanted to apply glass it used to be a

1272
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,559
glass psdf

1273
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,160
if you wanted diffuse there was a

1274
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,920
separate one for diffuse

1275
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,960
there's one for hair and there's one for

1276
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,680
refraction and specular and translucent

1277
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,000
and so

1278
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,160
on but the principled one can now then

1279
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,520
can now do most of these so you can

1280
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,760
choose principled and then apply a glass

1281
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,000
effect to it so that's the one that is

1282
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,760
most commonly used at least that's what

1283
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,359
i've heard

1284
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,599
so and that's the default so you don't

1285
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,200
have to choose it it just

1286
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,240
gets set as principled and the base

1287
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,119
color is

1288
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,599
white if you click on that you get a

1289
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,000
color wheel

1290
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,359
you can choose let's say a color like

1291
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,480
this

1292
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,319
and click on ok and you won't see

1293
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,079
anything if you're in this mode but if

1294
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:13,760
you go to solid preview

1295
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,599
you'll notice that the color is turned

1296
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,520
green and if you go to the rendered view

1297
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,400
it looks

1298
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,720
slightly even better compared to what

1299
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,240
it's

1300
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,598
actually going to look like

1301
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,240
like so so that's just one base color

1302
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,440
but you can do a lot of uh

1303
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,640
tweaks to this one tweak is uh

1304
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,839
for example metallic it's at zero right

1305
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:40,559
or before the

1306
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,960
metallic let me show you roughness

1307
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,079
roughness is

1308
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,359
how rough or smooth or shiny or

1309
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:50,880
matte it is so the bigger the number the

1310
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,440
more

1311
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,760
matte it becomes and the smaller the

1312
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,760
number the more shinier it becomes

1313
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,000
so i click on this click on control and

1314
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,880
bring it down to something like

1315
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,960
0.1 it's going to be pretty shiny

1316
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,000
like so and and now

1317
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:15,839
if i kind of move around

1318
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,400
let me see if i can reduce the number of

1319
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,680
oh let me

1320
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,280
just go here yeah so

1321
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,040
if you can see the trees over here that

1322
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,400
means it's a very shiny

1323
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,200
object the trees are the default what

1324
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,079
they call as the

1325
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,319
hdr background that comes around

1326
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,559
in blender you don't see it but it's

1327
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,160
there somewhere in this background over

1328
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:38,720
here

1329
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,640
and that's what you see reflected over

1330
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,839
here but

1331
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:45,920
if you choose the plane go back to

1332
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,880
properties and reduce increase roughness

1333
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,680
you'll notice

1334
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,680
that it becomes matte like so

1335
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,400
so that's how matte or shiny it is let's

1336
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,160
choose something like

1337
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,000
0.2 and then you can increase the

1338
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,040
the metallic sheen of it by

1339
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:10,799
cranking it up like so for example

1340
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,119
so that's one way of choosing color you

1341
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:14,559
can change colors to

1342
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:17,200
whatever you feel and so on right so

1343
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,319
that's

1344
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:22,319
you can set rgb values so

1345
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,160
let's see if have incre we've progressed

1346
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,760
with the

1347
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,200
looks like this thing is stuck so i'm

1348
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,599
going to close this and come back to

1349
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,000
that later

1350
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,599
so that's setting color to your plane

1351
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,760
that's the simple way of doing things

1352
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,359
the other way is to apply

1353
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:42,559
an external texture as an image

1354
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,640
to this plane and that's really much

1355
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,079
more interesting because you can start

1356
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:46,960
doing things like

1357
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,559
uh wood or marble and so on stone for

1358
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:51,599
example

1359
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,920
and you do that by clicking on the

1360
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,880
little circle next to the base color

1361
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,920
that brings up your context menu

1362
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,440
and choose image texture

1363
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,880
once you do image texture you get you

1364
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,319
expand this properties tab you get a new

1365
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:11,359
and open

1366
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:14,480
option so click on open

1367
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,799
and i have a couple of textures that i

1368
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,079
have saved

1369
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,200
let me go there desktop

1370
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,720
uh blender materials oh

1371
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,280
let me see let me try wood

1372
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,720
stored under jpeg as

1373
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:38,480
the albedo click on open image

1374
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,359
so there's the wood texture

1375
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,240
it's as easy as that so it's really kind

1376
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,440
of very easy to

1377
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,640
set something like so at

1378
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,440
this point the texture is really

1379
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,079
extremely

1380
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,119
flat and doesn't have any surface

1381
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,160
roughness or imperfections and so on

1382
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,160
so we will figure out how to add that

1383
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,640
later but again this is the bare minimum

1384
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,319
you can

1385
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:10,160
do this and because you've set the

1386
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,160
roughness very low it's kind of very

1387
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,599
shiny so we can

1388
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,000
come back here to roughness and increase

1389
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,359
it to

1390
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,400
the median point five

1391
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,440
let me get slightly more

1392
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,440
0.7 there you go

1393
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,880
so that's how you set material for your

1394
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:31,760
plane

1395
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,359
and if you want to make it a

1396
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:38,559
little bit more realistic we can

1397
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,599
do that as well before that let me show

1398
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,760
you what happens when you download

1399
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,039
blender materials

1400
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,480
so materials

1401
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,520
let me just select

1402
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,078
something like this

1403
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,880
so a lot of the materials that you can

1404
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,079
get off on the

1405
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:02,319
internet for example blender guru has

1406
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,559
several free textures and materials that

1407
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,079
you can download and there are a lot of

1408
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,839
other resources available for

1409
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:11,280
materials is you can get

1410
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,119
i mean they come in different let's say

1411
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,079
layers so there is a color layer for

1412
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,359
each

1413
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:22,319
material there is also sometimes they

1414
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:22,960
are called

1415
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,960
differently but you can have gloss and

1416
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,240
you can have normal

1417
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,400
you can have a reflection layer you can

1418
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,319
have albedo

1419
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:33,760
and and so on and by using those

1420
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,119
over here you can turn this flat

1421
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,319
surface into a slightly textured

1422
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,280
three-dimensional appearance for example

1423
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,720
and that's

1424
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,520
where it kind of gets pretty interesting

1425
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:47,920
so

1426
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,400
let's see how we can do that you access

1427
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,920
get into that using the nodes feature

1428
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,319
for anyone who's used uh programs like

1429
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,200
grasshopper

1430
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,920
or many of the others you know what

1431
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,720
nodes are

1432
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,920
blocks of repetitive code that you can

1433
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,839
kind of plug in and with uh

1434
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,640
blender you access that by going to

1435
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,520
shading

1436
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,599
so that's the shading tab here at the

1437
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,039
top

1438
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,440
once you click that you get your nodes

1439
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,319
like so

1440
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:23,920
this is the existing node for the plane

1441
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,960
that you have

1442
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,000
selected which is

1443
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:33,680
over here and so we can see some changes

1444
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,280
as they happen

1445
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,920
like so so we have the the wood

1446
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,119
material that is the jpeg image that we

1447
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,599
selected that goes as the base color to

1448
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:46,319
this

1449
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,880
bsdf shader and then that goes as the

1450
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,680
output

1451
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,760
for the material but we want to make

1452
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,920
things more interesting here

1453
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,559
so let's go to here's your file browser

1454
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:57,280
on the left

1455
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,720
so you can go to a desktop you can even

1456
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,280
drop it directly from your

1457
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,359
explorer window if you want to desktop

1458
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,759
docs

1459
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,720
materials

1460
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,640
chosen

1461
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,280
and alberto is the one that has been

1462
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,039
used here but

1463
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,559
to give the surface bumpiness

1464
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,480
you need what is known as the normal map

1465
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,359
and you'll notice it's usually a

1466
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:32,160
violet or blue colored uh texture like

1467
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:32,559
so

1468
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,440
but it contains the height map is sorry

1469
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,880
height map information

1470
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,240
so i can drag that and bring it here

1471
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,879
into play

1472
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:47,520
and i want to make sure this color

1473
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,960
goes as an input

1474
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,039
to the normal input on your

1475
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,520
setting but before you do that you have

1476
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,720
to tell it that this is

1477
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,280
a bump map and there are two things to

1478
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,720
do that

1479
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,559
first is make sure you select the color

1480
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,880
space and tell it that this is

1481
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,880
a non-color texture which means

1482
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,839
the one you chose earlier is an rgb

1483
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:14,559
color

1484
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,680
but this one doesn't contain color

1485
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,280
information but something that is

1486
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,160
besides

1487
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,760
the color information and we add a node

1488
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,799
over here in the middle

1489
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,079
called let me try and remember

1490
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:31,599
i am going to use a bump

1491
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,960
i think yeah

1492
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,720
and place it here in the middle

1493
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,240
and the way things work is at least

1494
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,000
that's what i've been told in blender is

1495
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,160
the colors match to color so if you have

1496
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,799
a yellow circle here it needs to go to

1497
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,240
one of the yellow circles

1498
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,799
over here if you have a blue it needs to

1499
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:56,160
match to a blue for example

1500
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,200
green goes to green and so on so because

1501
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,039
we have yellow here and then

1502
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,280
normal is blue we can't disconnect it

1503
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,400
directly

1504
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,720
and hence the bump in between that

1505
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,559
converts

1506
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,079
the color information is

1507
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:15,440
normal and then i can plug

1508
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,960
the output of the bump map to the normal

1509
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,719
over here and i don't know if you notice

1510
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:25,279
but there has been a distinct change in

1511
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:25,839
the

1512
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,439
texture if you look at it head on

1513
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,880
it kind of looks

1514
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:39,040
better let me see

1515
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:43,359
yeah the other thing we can

1516
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:48,158
do is there is a specular

1517
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:53,839
displacement and uh

1518
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:01,679
yeah so we grab a

1519
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,799
bump again i am

1520
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,679
i am bringing it here because uh like i

1521
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:08,560
said the names

1522
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,439
differ every time it's not always

1523
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:12,158
there's no

1524
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,120
convention to how the various material

1525
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,479
layers are named

1526
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:19,679
but what i want to do is

1527
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,960
take a bump

1528
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,640
and give that to the roughness

1529
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,520
input on our main material so instead of

1530
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,238
setting a physical value here

1531
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:34,560
you want certain parts to be shinier and

1532
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,040
other parts to be rougher

1533
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,520
and that's determined by the bump map os

1534
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,679
once again i'm going to do another

1535
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:47,040
bump node addition to a shift a search

1536
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:52,319
pump put that here connect color

1537
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,320
yes normal and

1538
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:03,840
the output goes to roughness

1539
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,040
and i guess i did something wrong okay

1540
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,400
here it is yep

1541
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,480
so that's how you kind of

1542
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,199
make things better and probably i didn't

1543
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,760
use the right

1544
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,880
material because you can use something

1545
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,320
else that gives a better

1546
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,560
illustration of what the way this works

1547
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,400
so let me try and do that let me change

1548
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,360
the

1549
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:40,159
base material over here let's get rid of

1550
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:45,840
all of these that

1551
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,640
we have put here

1552
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,600
okay my computer's become seriously

1553
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,440
laggy

1554
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:00,880
okay and now we're back to

1555
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,840
the basic white texture yep

1556
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,239
i'm going to choose a different material

1557
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:08,880
to

1558
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,840
better illustrate how the bump map the

1559
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,800
normal map

1560
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,719
works let me see if i can choose

1561
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:19,920
rust rust was pretty good

1562
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,199
go to rust

1563
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:26,800
and that's the variant one

1564
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,560
which i bring in here

1565
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,239
zoom in and collect color to the

1566
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:38,718
oops connect color to base color

1567
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,360
so we should see something that looks

1568
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,719
like uh

1569
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,600
rusted metal

1570
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,320
there you go

1571
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:54,480
this is open

1572
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,600
so you can see it better and then

1573
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:02,480
let's uh repeat this with the

1574
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:07,040
normal so here's the normal map big one

1575
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,480
connect color

1576
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:14,159
to normal

1577
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,520
i think you can probably notice that

1578
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,280
there is a substantial

1579
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,760
improvement in how the texture looks if

1580
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,640
i disconnect

1581
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,600
normal it kind of looks much

1582
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,199
flatter

1583
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,280
there you go and then once i connect

1584
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:42,159
normal things look a little bit

1585
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,559
better

1586
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,360
and uh let's also add

1587
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:53,120
the other map the

1588
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,840
reflection

1589
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:11,040
that's the gloss okay yep so the gloss

1590
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,960
for example is going to go to your

1591
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:19,040
roughness now

1592
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,000
connect normal here

1593
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,840
and that applies a variable amount of

1594
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,080
shininess to different parts of your

1595
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:37,199
surface over here so that's so

1596
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,280
let me just go back to heavy and go back

1597
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,320
to layout

1598
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,640
so we can get nice idea of what it's

1599
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,159
actually going to look like

1600
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:48,400
there

1601
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,080
like so

1602
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,280
okay so at this point again i think for

1603
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,280
some reason the lights are still too

1604
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,199
bright so we will go to light

1605
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,440
and set this to

1606
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:11,919
100 and the

1607
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,840
twilight

1608
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,000
we can tone them down to one watts

1609
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
each one

1610
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
one and make this

1611
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,199
one as well and

1612
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:42,640
the main light too it to

1613
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:47,920
something like 50.

1614
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,880
good so let's see if we can get this uh

1615
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,000
render to start with

1616
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:07,520
sorry it isn't uh as fast as we

1617
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,080
hope it to be that's because i'm doing a

1618
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,679
video

1619
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:16,080
along with rendering so

1620
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,400
let's see if all right it started doing

1621
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:20,719
this

1622
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,239
you're gonna have to wait for a while

1623
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,360
and see

1624
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,239
so that's the next stage of getting to

1625
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:29,120
realism

1626
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,000
and then finally we get to the real

1627
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,520
prosthetics of this

1628
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,640
how can you change

1629
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,640
all of this stuff you see on the pc

1630
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,159
pizza as you can see almost all of the

1631
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,120
materials have

1632
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,040
uh kind of a standard uh

1633
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,480
rough finish whereas actually some of

1634
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,040
the

1635
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,440
for example the the black plastic is

1636
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,880
going to be pretty shiny

1637
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,480
the metal on the coin cell holder is

1638
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,400
going to be pretty shiny and so on

1639
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,960
the plastic on the button will be shiny

1640
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,080
so we need to

1641
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,679
start playing around with those and

1642
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:08,000
also if you want to change the default

1643
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,800
colors for the

1644
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,520
pcb mask and and

1645
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,719
silk legend and so on

1646
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:21,440
so for that let me collapse the main

1647
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,040
collection and expand

1648
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,719
the pcb

1649
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:30,320
and over here

1650
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:34,080
if you scroll all the way down

1651
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,679
then the last couple of layers

1652
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,120
are going to be the ones related to the

1653
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,080
printed circuit board and the rest of

1654
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,280
the elements

1655
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,400
belong to the various components

1656
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,679
so we can kind of identify them

1657
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:54,800
by hiding these

1658
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,239
click on the eye icon and start

1659
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,360
hiding things there goes the

1660
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:05,599
front uh silk legend

1661
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,400
that's the bottom likely that's the

1662
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,840
bottom

1663
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,040
that's the front that's the

1664
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,560
copper on the front the sides

1665
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,920
and that's the uh

1666
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,120
the whole pc so all we have here is uh

1667
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,600
the components now okay make things

1668
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,640
easier let me

1669
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,360
choose the plane and hide it so on the

1670
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,080
keyboard you can

1671
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,400
press h to hide an element like so

1672
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:38,560
so we have all the pcb elements hidden

1673
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,600
and now we can see if we can

1674
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,960
rename them for better

1675
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,080
let's say legibility if we unhide this

1676
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:48,719
one

1677
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,159
we can see it's the bottom silk legend

1678
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:54,159
so i'm going to

1679
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:57,920
do an f2 over here to rename this and

1680
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,679
just to make sure that it goes right at

1681
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,000
the

1682
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,719
top of the stack so it's easier to you

1683
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:03,199
know

1684
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:04,640
work around with it i'm just going to

1685
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,080
start it with the alphabet a

1686
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,719
underscore

1687
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:15,919
uh silk bottom

1688
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,120
and leave it at that so that's

1689
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,519
my

1690
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:26,640
silk at the bottom very top

1691
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,199
and let's choose another one and see

1692
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:30,640
which one that turns out to be this is

1693
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:31,760
the top silk

1694
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,840
so again press f2 here

1695
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,960
f2 a underscore

1696
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,480
silk top and

1697
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:48,159
let that go this one

1698
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:52,159
is pads is it on the bottom

1699
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:56,239
or the top okay it looks like the

1700
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:59,760
bottom so these are the copper pads on

1701
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,280
the bottom

1702
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:06,480
choose this press f2 a underscore

1703
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,280
pads bottom

1704
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,560
that's that unhide the other one

1705
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,760
this is uh tracks on the bottom so

1706
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,960
select the shape press f2

1707
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,640
a underscore copper

1708
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:29,520
bottom like that

1709
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,560
this one is pads on the top so select

1710
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,600
this

1711
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,840
f2 a underscore

1712
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,679
ads top

1713
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,678
and hide the next one

1714
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,840
that is the tracks on the top so

1715
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,000
f2 a underscore copper

1716
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,880
top there goes that

1717
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,400
that's the sides

1718
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,440
of the printed circuit board so if you

1719
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,320
unhide and hide it you can see that so

1720
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,159
i'm going to name it

1721
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:14,400
a

1722
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,480
underscore pcb

1723
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,678
underscore sites

1724
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,760
and finally the last one over here is

1725
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,170
the

1726
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:27,440
[Music]

1727
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,000
top and bottom layers of the pcb so i'm

1728
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,800
going to call them the mask

1729
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,560
f2 a underscore

1730
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,000
pcb underscore mask

1731
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,840
okay so we have all these essential

1732
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,840
layers

1733
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,600
and let's just play with those first so

1734
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,679
i'm going to zoom out go to

1735
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:01,199
my collection that contains the camera

1736
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:04,400
and the lights and hide

1737
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,639
that whole collection so that's out of

1738
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:07,760
the way

1739
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,600
and i'm going to also

1740
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,199
then choose the

1741
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:19,679
select arrow icon go to x-ray

1742
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,320
choose all of these parts and hide them

1743
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,280
all by doing

1744
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,080
an edge on the keyboard so that hides

1745
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,520
everything so i've got everything hidden

1746
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,199
on my

1747
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:32,239
uh scene now then i can

1748
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:34,638
go to

1749
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,960
my pcb collection and unhide

1750
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:46,080
just the pcb parts underneath the plane

1751
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,440
look at it like so so here's just the

1752
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,919
pcb

1753
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,960
and like we did with the uh with the

1754
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:57,440
plane

1755
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,679
we can start giving colors to these uh

1756
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:00,719
different materials so

1757
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,520
let's say you want a black mask with a

1758
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,159
white

1759
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:07,440
legend so we want to basically convert

1760
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,719
mask and copper to black

1761
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:15,520
the other thing i need to point out is

1762
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,679
let me show this to you and crack it

1763
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:19,120
hopefully i can manage it with

1764
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,920
everything running

1765
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,840
okay let's see

1766
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,080
oh

1767
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,840
okay since i'm here let us do it

1768
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,840
pcb

1769
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:46,159
things are really crawling down now how

1770
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:53,839
am i doing on time eliot

1771
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,960
let me check

1772
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,840
i got about 15-20 minutes

1773
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,320
okay so we're pretty close to where we

1774
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,480
want to be the but

1775
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:11,519
yeah what i need to do is

1776
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,559
look at

1777
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:19,120
where am i yeah okay

1778
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,840
okay

1779
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:26,400
your battery may be running low you're

1780
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,040
at 19

1781
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,000
oh jeez i didn't plug it in

1782
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,840
if you need to plug in take a sec

1783
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,800
thanks for that peter from the comments

1784
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,400
thanks peter

1785
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:52,080
thank you peter okay so

1786
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:57,440
very very quickly what

1787
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,880
so here's the typical render output from

1788
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,330
kai-ken and

1789
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:07,470
[Music]

1790
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:13,360
if you'll notice this part is

1791
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,560
unmasked but when you do the vrml export

1792
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,600
from kai-ked

1793
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,840
it gets masked over i think that's the

1794
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,679
limitation of kai-ket i'm not sure why

1795
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,520
but there is a way to fix it in blender

1796
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,320
with

1797
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,880
a couple of extra steps but more

1798
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:27,679
importantly

1799
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,040
the the plated through holes

1800
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:34,159
they also disappear in blender

1801
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:36,080
this is gold plated over here for

1802
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,199
example

1803
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:40,960
but if you look at

1804
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,080
blender you'll notice it's green over

1805
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:44,480
here

1806
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,400
so it's lost all the plated through

1807
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,840
holes the reason is

1808
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,679
the pcb sides

1809
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:54,800
which is this one is

1810
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,040
all one layer in in blender

1811
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:03,760
so there's a way to uh to fix that but

1812
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,679
it needs a couple more extra steps but

1813
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:07,440
first let's get quickly to what we want

1814
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,199
to do we want to

1815
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:11,760
add some more realism to the pcb by

1816
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,440
adding a thickness to these

1817
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,920
various layers so we're going to choose

1818
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:16,480
the

1819
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,600
top copper layer

1820
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,080
and we want to apply what's we usually

1821
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,320
call in cad as an extrude function

1822
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,360
so in blender you select the object

1823
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,159
and you go to the the wrench icon over

1824
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:31,679
here this panel

1825
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,480
that brings up modifiers click on add

1826
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,159
modifier

1827
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:39,760
and choose solidify so what that does is

1828
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,400
gives

1829
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:44,080
a certain amount of uh thickness

1830
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:47,199
to your copper

1831
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:50,800
like so so let's see the value right now

1832
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,239
is offset is negative

1833
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:57,679
one so we want to bring it to positive

1834
01:25:57,679 --> 01:25:59,440
one

1835
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,919
and

1836
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:09,839
there is something wrong over here

1837
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,880
okay i think i have messed up all the

1838
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,239
units but it's okay

1839
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:17,519
well it's gonna be

1840
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,639
100 is too much you get 10

1841
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:28,480
that's too less probably 20.

1842
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:33,360
so if i kind of

1843
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,120
scroll in you can see we have a nice

1844
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,280
thickness added to the

1845
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,400
tracks so that's your copper top

1846
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,239
and you want to do the same with the

1847
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,800
copper bottom so choose copper bottom

1848
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,480
add modifier solidify

1849
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,600
make this 20

1850
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,080
sorry about the units uh make the offset

1851
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,340
positive one and now the

1852
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,560
[Music]

1853
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,679
bottom tracks also will get a certain

1854
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:05,120
thickness

1855
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,719
so that's copper top and bottom

1856
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,520
and you need to apply the same thickness

1857
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,320
to the pads

1858
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:16,799
so which is pads bottom

1859
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:20,818
[Music]

1860
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,840
okay meanwhile the

1861
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,080
render has turned out wow the light is

1862
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,440
too less

1863
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:41,360
but anyway if you

1864
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:45,199
zoom in over here you'll notice the uh

1865
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:50,719
the noise is pretty much kind of reduced

1866
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,520
so let's get back here why can't i get

1867
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,280
rid of this

1868
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:59,040
escape i hope i didn't hang up

1869
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,840
linda

1870
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,840
okay well wait for it any questions

1871
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,679
happy to answer them well

1872
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:12,239
this tries to get unstuck sorry about

1873
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,280
this let me try and close

1874
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,960
uh extra windows

1875
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,679
if i can

1876
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,000
there's really nothing that except maybe

1877
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,040
the actual render window

1878
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,440
we've had two well one random question

1879
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:32,320
along the way

1880
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:36,080
um which is what are the specs for your

1881
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,840
computer

1882
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,480
oh okay it's pretty ancient and this one

1883
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,520
is a five-year-old

1884
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,199
laptop i am not sure what processor it

1885
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:46,080
had but

1886
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:50,239
probably a core i5 4gb ram so pretty

1887
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:50,560
much

1888
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,120
basic it's not too too fancy it's a

1889
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,760
lenovo x250

1890
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,040
right on yep

1891
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,920
all right so and the other ones i forgot

1892
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,480
this class started 15 minutes later so

1893
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,320
you have 30 minutes actually so take

1894
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,320
your time okay

1895
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,960
all right let me see if i can get

1896
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:11,920
unstuck on this

1897
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,239
some reason it's refusing to move out of

1898
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:15,840
this

1899
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:19,440
thing so maybe i can just close it and

1900
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,799
restart again hopefully

1901
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,679
okay let's try that i didn't even save

1902
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:28,239
this so

1903
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:32,879
i'm gonna take a brain check on this

1904
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,880
quit two windows and start all over

1905
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,199
again

1906
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:48,639
so at this point uh the process is to

1907
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:49,520
apply

1908
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:53,120
the solidify modifiers to

1909
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:56,639
your top and bottom copper layers

1910
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:59,760
to your top and bottom

1911
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,960
copper pads and

1912
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:08,880
also a solidifier modifier to the

1913
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,239
uh silk legends but that needs to be a

1914
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:12,719
bit

1915
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:15,040
taller than what you applied to the

1916
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,440
copper layers because the circulation

1917
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:22,239
goes over the uh copper

1918
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,159
so instead of 20 we could choose

1919
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:29,120
something like

1920
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:34,000
maybe 25 or 30 to make it uh

1921
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,239
just kill blender and be done with it

1922
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:44,000
okay then

1923
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:49,840
start all over again there you go

1924
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:53,520
so very quickly i'm going to start off

1925
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,280
where i stopped file

1926
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:02,159
import wr

1927
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:04,400
i'm going to bother too much with the

1928
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,760
plane and the

1929
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,440
other settings just going to show you

1930
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,239
the pcb part

1931
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:12,480
so

1932
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:31,840
we fine to set up input

1933
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,199
one of the question i received on

1934
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,840
twitter was uh

1935
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,440
the patch will fall off if there's no

1936
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,600
solder on the pcb which is

1937
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,600
quite right right if you want to have

1938
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,159
realistic

1939
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:47,920
renders you need to figure out a way to

1940
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,560
add a solder to the

1941
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:53,840
copper pads but probably that's a

1942
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,560
something to be

1943
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,159
worked out i have i don't really have an

1944
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:01,520
idea how that works

1945
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:06,159
though not not at this moment though

1946
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:09,199
you could make a song in uh

1947
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:11,760
blender and just add it at every pad but

1948
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,719
that'd be horrible

1949
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,679
yeah i mean i'm sure there is an easy

1950
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:19,040
way to do it like

1951
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,199
blender has a nice particle system where

1952
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,120
you can like if you look if you remember

1953
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,040
the donut there were these sprinkles all

1954
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,320
over it yeah so

1955
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,719
that's done by select like making one or

1956
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,159
two different kinds of sprinkles and

1957
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:31,840
then just

1958
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,840
randomly putting it all over the donut

1959
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,600
but i'm sure you can

1960
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,159
figure out a way to put uh solder joints

1961
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:39,440
like so on the

1962
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:43,040
on the board that'd be fun

1963
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:47,360
yeah all right so uh

1964
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:55,199
let me just get straight away to

1965
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:58,559
this okay and then

1966
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:03,520
choose all of these and

1967
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,320
hide all of it

1968
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,840
oops

1969
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:23,840
wow is that ready

1970
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:45,839
a minute as i get this back

1971
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,840
okay

1972
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,920
select this this

1973
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,840
all right so we can

1974
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:03,120
add solidify modifiers to the

1975
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,520
top and bottom silk layers you've

1976
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,040
already seen that so i won't repeat it

1977
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,480
again

1978
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,520
same to the bottom pads

1979
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,440
and tracks same to the top

1980
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,560
pads and tracks

1981
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,520
and that's the sides and that's the top

1982
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,320
so

1983
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,400
assuming that we've done what we did

1984
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,760
earlier which i kind of messed up

1985
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:33,679
we can now start playing with the colors

1986
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:35,840
which is kind of similar to what we did

1987
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,120
with

1988
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:40,960
the plane so let me select the top

1989
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,199
let's say copper tracks then go to

1990
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:48,880
material and if you already

1991
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:53,199
named it then it will be nice to

1992
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,880
to reuse that material in other places

1993
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,000
but right now i'm kind of trying to rush

1994
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,320
through this or keeping the same name so

1995
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,440
we have the

1996
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:07,040
top tracks selected we have the material

1997
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,239
properties selected

1998
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:11,280
click on use nodes that allows you to

1999
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:14,719
use all of the great settings over here

2000
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:19,440
go to base color and choose

2001
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,760
you're going for black mask right so we

2002
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,199
just want to darken the

2003
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:30,719
so if you look at some photos

2004
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:33,119
i think the way it works is the tracks

2005
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:34,800
are a bit lighter

2006
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,880
and the actual pcb is a bit darker so

2007
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,600
you've chosen the tracks and made them

2008
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,400
kind of

2009
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:46,159
dark gray and the same gets applied to

2010
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:47,760
the bottom tracks as well because they

2011
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,280
share the same material so

2012
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,880
that is kind of useful you have to do it

2013
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,440
just once

2014
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:58,400
then we can choose the top and bottom

2015
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,719
layers again since they share the same

2016
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:02,800
material we can do it just once i

2017
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,440
choose i click over here once go to

2018
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,600
material

2019
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:11,440
click on use notes notice it turns white

2020
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:15,199
and now i want to turn this

2021
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:18,239
darker than the tracks like so something

2022
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,559
like that

2023
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,000
there you go and and now you can play

2024
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:24,800
around with

2025
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,360
some more stuff you can choose this uh

2026
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,719
layer and make it uh

2027
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:31,760
shiny because it's going to reflect

2028
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,560
fair amount of light so bring it to like

2029
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,920
0.2

2030
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,400
you can see it's kind of become shiny

2031
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,920
now

2032
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,880
choose the same for the uh tracks so

2033
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,000
choose the tracks

2034
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,560
and dial down the roughness to something

2035
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,440
like 0.2

2036
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,639
so that's your mask

2037
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,199
color is pretty much set we can then

2038
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:56,000
choose the

2039
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,719
[Music]

2040
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:02,400
uh the pads so choose the top pad layer

2041
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,920
and because again they share the same

2042
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:04,560
material

2043
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,639
you have to do it just once and it

2044
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:07,600
applies for both

2045
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,480
top and bottom so chosen the top pads

2046
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,520
layer

2047
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,960
in the materials properties choose

2048
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:18,320
nodes click on base color you wanted

2049
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,119
something

2050
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:22,000
that looks like gold for example so

2051
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,679
something that sits between

2052
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:26,080
yellow and orange i'm sure we can dial

2053
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,840
down the exact settings

2054
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,360
later but gold is metallic

2055
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:34,880
so we're going to dial up the metallic

2056
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,880
option to about point eight and the

2057
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:42,320
roughness is down to like point

2058
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:48,000
two flexible that gives you a nice

2059
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,119
that's a shiny gold finish for your

2060
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:54,560
copper pads on the top and the bottom

2061
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:58,800
sides like so

2062
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,639
and you also want the silk layers to be

2063
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:05,760
pretty shiny because it's a

2064
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,800
silk screen so we choose the top

2065
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:13,440
silk legend layer go to material

2066
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,560
select nodes it needs to be white

2067
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,199
but we just want to make it shiny so

2068
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:20,320
just dial down

2069
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:23,679
roughness to about 0.2

2070
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:27,280
you have a nice shiny

2071
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:33,360
silk legend as well like so

2072
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:39,920
and now finally if you want to

2073
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:44,159
let me

2074
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:46,960
hide the

2075
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:52,960
camera and the light and

2076
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:59,840
select all of those press h

2077
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,639
go down and unhide

2078
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:10,159
circuit board almost like so

2079
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:14,080
upside yeah so that's your

2080
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:18,400
bare circuit board now and

2081
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,840
if you choose this

2082
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:28,480
vertical layer and give it a color

2083
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:32,159
which is the same as gold

2084
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:34,960
so equal to

2085
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:41,839
just a row yeah

2086
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,440
choose the sides

2087
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,480
choose notes okay

2088
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:55,920
let's link to the same color i guess

2089
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,760
yeah okay so let me do a

2090
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,639
ctrl c

2091
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:08,960
one more time okay so

2092
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:12,000
the the sides have the same

2093
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,239
material being applied as the top and

2094
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:15,520
the bottom mask

2095
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,400
colors so which is why you need to

2096
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,199
unlink

2097
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:21,760
this color from the other two colors you

2098
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:24,159
do that by selecting this

2099
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:27,840
side over here and and

2100
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:33,600
in the text in the material properties

2101
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,840
the

2102
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:42,400
the material over here if you look at

2103
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,320
the drop down it says shape

2104
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:47,520
1924 you kind of delete

2105
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,719
that so that becomes

2106
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:54,320
gray now the top and the bottom stay

2107
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,960
as we had chosen to be black but the

2108
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,520
sides

2109
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:02,800
are now gray and now now we can apply

2110
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,159
oh

2111
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:07,360
i choose a new material to this

2112
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:11,520
clicking new clicking use nodes

2113
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:16,239
clicking on base color and

2114
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:18,639
if you want the plated through holes to

2115
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:19,280
be gold

2116
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,679
then you're going to have to change it

2117
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:23,119
into something like this

2118
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:26,159
for example but if you want

2119
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:30,320
the edges to be green then we need to

2120
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:34,400
get to something like

2121
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,760
this with a very dark shade i think

2122
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:38,480
that's what

2123
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,400
glass fiber looks like i guess well at

2124
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:43,520
least approximately just to green

2125
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:46,639
it down to oh yeah something like that

2126
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:49,119
but then that's just the same color for

2127
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:50,239
the uh

2128
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:52,800
pleated through pads as well so one way

2129
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,000
of fixing this

2130
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,679
is to first of all i'm going to hide the

2131
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:00,719
layers not required so click on the

2132
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:04,400
top and bottom mask height then

2133
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:08,159
the top silk hide it

2134
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:11,760
bottom hide it

2135
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,640
bottom tracks autumn

2136
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:16,759
[Music]

2137
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:20,480
top pads and

2138
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,920
bottom pads and what i'm left with now

2139
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:28,400
is all the vertical faces of the pcb

2140
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,119
and what i'm interested now is to make

2141
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:31,840
sure that

2142
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,000
i

2143
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:40,560
look at it from the top

2144
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:44,000
oops yeah what i'm interested in is this

2145
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,560
whole

2146
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,920
selection i want to deselect the outline

2147
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:48,800
layer or

2148
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,800
in kai-ken what we know how to see edge

2149
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,239
cuts layer

2150
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:55,280
and deselect it from the rest of these

2151
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:58,239
holes once you do that you can apply two

2152
01:42:58,239 --> 01:42:59,440
separate materials

2153
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,920
one to the edges and the other to the

2154
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,520
vertical holes over here

2155
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,880
so vertical holes can then be golden

2156
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:09,840
and the edges of the pcb can be the

2157
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:12,000
green fiberglass color that

2158
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,520
which so to do that you get into

2159
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:18,639
what's known as edit mode in blender

2160
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:20,800
up until now we've been in object mode

2161
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,000
which is

2162
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,920
what you see here at the top left but

2163
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,600
when you choose the drop down

2164
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,639
you need to choose

2165
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:34,400
an object and then if you see

2166
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,199
that drop down you get the edit mode

2167
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:37,600
choose

2168
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:41,040
edit and now uh this is where the

2169
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,280
tricky part comes in painstakingly you

2170
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,320
have to select

2171
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:47,360
by doing box select and grab

2172
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:50,159
all of these

2173
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:53,280
let's say elements that form the edges

2174
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:56,239
and separate it out from the rest so

2175
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:59,119
let's see if i can give it a shot select

2176
01:43:59,119 --> 01:43:59,920
this

2177
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:03,119
so that's selected

2178
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:06,000
oh that's there sometimes you go to a

2179
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,040
zoom in to

2180
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:10,560
grab the right oops

2181
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,639
shift select so start again

2182
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:18,719
that's a shift select let's shift select

2183
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:22,080
some more over here make sure i don't

2184
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:22,960
select the

2185
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:35,840
holes that

2186
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,600
select this whole box over here

2187
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:46,960
select all of this

2188
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:51,759
yeah yeah

2189
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:03,840
get that get this corner

2190
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:18,159
shift

2191
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:32,320
well if you have a rectangle outline

2192
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:33,520
things are much easier

2193
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:36,239
you don't have to

2194
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,320
break your head so much

2195
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:45,360
okay so hopefully i have all of these uh

2196
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,119
selected so that's just the edges

2197
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:48,880
selected

2198
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:52,000
now let me make sure that i i can't

2199
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,560
remember the

2200
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:59,840
it's

2201
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,320
make sure that okay p to separate path

2202
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,560
so the command to separate out this

2203
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:27,840
is uh p for papa

2204
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:31,920
you get separate what you have selected

2205
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:32,480
or

2206
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,320
if you have selected material or layer

2207
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,760
so we need to have

2208
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,880
separate the selection

2209
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:43,679
and when you do that you should see

2210
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:46,880
let me expand this collection tree so

2211
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,360
you can

2212
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:50,800
see it clearly is

2213
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,840
the the earlier collection was a shape

2214
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:54,960
1925

2215
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:58,239
indexed face set but the new one is

2216
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:01,280
with a dot zero zero one extension so

2217
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:04,719
these are just the holes

2218
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:08,480
and this is the separate edge

2219
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:11,920
of the pcb so once we have done that we

2220
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:12,320
can

2221
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:16,080
go back to object mode

2222
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:23,840
go back to solid view

2223
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:28,800
like so choose

2224
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,719
the the chosen is a fictional novel

2225
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:34,400
written by

2226
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:37,520
alexa stop

2227
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,119
i'm sorry about that i don't know why

2228
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:41,119
alexa popped up

2229
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:44,159
so we can give this a color

2230
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:49,679
which is first published in 1967

2231
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:51,840
it follows the narrator reuben walter

2232
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,600
and his friend daniel saunders

2233
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,960
as they grow up in the rooms

2234
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:00,000
[Music]

2235
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
so anyway that's gold and let's

2236
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,080
make sure that okay i need to make sure

2237
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,239
i use notes so

2238
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:11,920
click on nodes make sure i get

2239
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:14,239
gold

2240
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:19,840
make it shiny

2241
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,480
and that's these vertical faces but

2242
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,199
because that

2243
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:24,960
is linked to the material that we have

2244
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,880
separated they both have the same color

2245
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:27,920
right now

2246
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:32,960
so finally we can select the edges

2247
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:36,000
click on nodes and

2248
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,080
delete this material which it is using

2249
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:43,199
it becomes gray we can then choose

2250
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:47,360
new material use nodes color

2251
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:50,639
set oh maybe choose this totally

2252
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:52,480
different color so we can distinguish it

2253
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:53,199
from the

2254
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:58,000
rest of the something like this

2255
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:02,000
and oops

2256
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:08,400
like so and it's pretty rough

2257
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,719
there's no shininess in the edge of the

2258
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:13,199
pcb so let's crank up roughness to

2259
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:16,719
something like 0.9

2260
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:19,840
so we now have that

2261
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,960
fixed let's do let's unhide everything

2262
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:24,080
by doing an alt

2263
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:27,360
h that

2264
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:30,080
unhides everything and now if you look

2265
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:31,119
at this

2266
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:34,480
you'll notice we have the gold plating

2267
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:37,759
let me set the clipping

2268
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:43,840
quickly

2269
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,840
notice we have plated through holes in

2270
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:50,320
gold now and the edge of the pcb

2271
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,800
in whatever color you choose uh it's the

2272
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,000
wrong color right now but

2273
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,520
you get the idea what needs to be done

2274
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,920
and and uh from the earlier example

2275
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,520
we've already seen how we've added a

2276
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:02,560
thickness to these

2277
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:05,440
various layers so the sink layer and the

2278
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:06,560
tracks and the

2279
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:10,880
mask and so once you do that you are

2280
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,239
pretty close to

2281
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:15,280
an even more realistic uh let's say

2282
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,760
pcb representation compared to what you

2283
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,239
got from

2284
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:23,760
a kai cad and and from here on

2285
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,080
you can continue doing a lot more for

2286
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,480
example

2287
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,719
uh this depends on how much patience you

2288
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:32,480
have and how much time you want to spend

2289
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:34,080
on this but you can select

2290
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,560
each of these individual components and

2291
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:38,000
start giving them

2292
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,599
materials for example the resistor body

2293
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:44,719
like this one for example

2294
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:48,639
i can select that go to click nodes

2295
01:50:48,639 --> 01:50:52,320
uh choose a color or two

2296
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,719
something like this and it's pretty

2297
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:56,000
shiny so

2298
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,280
dial down the roughness

2299
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:03,280
like this and here you have a nice

2300
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,520
shiny resistor and you'll notice the

2301
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:06,800
other one isn't

2302
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:10,080
as good as this one so

2303
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,239
that's how it is now let's say you have

2304
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:13,199
already applied

2305
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:15,199
the material to this resistor but you

2306
01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:16,719
want to use it

2307
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:19,760
on the other one

2308
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:22,960
you choose the

2309
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,880
i can't remember if you choose the old

2310
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,080
material first or the

2311
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:28,480
new one let me try both choose the old

2312
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:30,639
material first

2313
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:34,560
shift and choose the

2314
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:38,159
new material do a control l for

2315
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:41,040
linking these two materials you get the

2316
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:44,080
make link materials

2317
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:47,360
yeah when you do that you have the

2318
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,840
material applied to this part of your

2319
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:50,639
resistor

2320
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:51,920
obviously you'll have to select the

2321
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,760
other parts of the body to apply the

2322
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,000
same material there as well

2323
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,719
but that's how you kind of start playing

2324
01:51:58,719 --> 01:51:59,199
around

2325
01:51:59,199 --> 01:51:59,880
let's take the

2326
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:04,409
[Music]

2327
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:16,719
box select so i select this whole

2328
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:18,560
cylinder and again

2329
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:23,280
material uh use nodes

2330
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:26,800
give it a nice red color and make it

2331
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:29,360
again really shiny by dialing down

2332
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:30,480
roughness

2333
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:33,760
to 0.2

2334
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,760
you have a nice shiny button

2335
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,960
which is like looks reflects light

2336
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,599
nicely and so on

2337
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:47,040
so using this and iterating this process

2338
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:47,760
you can

2339
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:52,080
kind of start giving the material

2340
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:54,480
settings to all the different parts on

2341
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:56,840
your pcb for example let me just choose

2342
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,000
this

2343
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,400
top surface of the

2344
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:05,599
leds and see if we can give them

2345
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:08,239
a glass

2346
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,480
surface so now instead of using

2347
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,080
principled

2348
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:17,520
i could use a transparency setting that

2349
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:18,080
is

2350
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:21,840
what i'm sure i saw one

2351
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:26,400
transparent transmission

2352
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:30,080
i guess how much of light oh yeah

2353
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:41,840
something like that

2354
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:48,400
let's try the glass shader so

2355
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,799
plus

2356
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:58,719
yeah now if you look at the

2357
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:01,040
rendered view mode things will look much

2358
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:03,360
better

2359
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:09,040
like so i'm

2360
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:12,639
cool we've got about

2361
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:14,880
oh sorry we got about one or two more

2362
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:15,679
minutes left

2363
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:18,800
so okay so let's make it really

2364
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,000
good i don't know how do you want to

2365
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,159
wrap it up yeah

2366
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:24,480
i guess i have transferred or talked

2367
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:26,159
about almost everything that i had

2368
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:28,560
listed in my

2369
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:30,960
document so i've covered so the point

2370
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,719
was to show you the techniques i mean it

2371
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:34,480
wasn't really to

2372
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:37,520
it's kind of difficult to to actually

2373
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,440
walk through the whole process but i

2374
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:42,080
think i have shown you all of the

2375
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:45,920
steps needed to get you to a proper

2376
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,639
like realistic renders and also i'm

2377
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:50,080
happy to answer questions now

2378
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:52,400
or later if there are questions now we

2379
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:53,679
can do that over the next couple of

2380
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:55,599
minutes

2381
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:57,199
yeah if anyone has any super quick

2382
01:54:57,199 --> 01:54:58,719
questions type them in

2383
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:02,480

2451
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:43,360
super quick question

2452
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:47,679
okay okay yeah yeah what is it

2453
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:51,840
oh is that the one about unity yeah do

2454
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:52,880
you know anything about

2455
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:56,080
unity how to export these to other game

2456
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,679
engines and newell

2457
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:00,400
oh absolutely no idea sorry this is

2458
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:02,000
something that

2459
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,760
i don't want to lead you down the wrong

2460
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:07,840
path by giving the wrong answer

2461
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:11,280
there are some nice blender forums so

2462
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,800
those would be the best ones to start

2463
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,400
with

2464
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,159
yeah i'm nearly certain that once you

2465
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:18,239
have stuff in blender it's a hop skip

2466
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:21,360
and a jump to get it off to unity

2467
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:24,400
but i don't know how myself either all

2468
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:25,840
right well thank you very much and

2469
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,679
