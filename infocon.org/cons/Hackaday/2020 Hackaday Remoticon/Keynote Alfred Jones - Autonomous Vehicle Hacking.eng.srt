2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,360
welcome thank you so much for joining us

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,000
tonight

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,400
at remoticon my name is mike stish i am

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,240
editor-in-chief of hackaday and it's my

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,400
honor to introduce tonight's keynote

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,119
speaker

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,199
it's pretty clear that the future is

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,039
definitely going to bring self-driving

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:21,520
cars

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,760
and the question is when and how are we

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,519
going to have those self-driving cars

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,680
the good news is alfred jones is working

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,199
on those answers

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,039
he's the head of mechanical engineering

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,200
and manufacturing at lyft's level five

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,640
self-driving division

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,880
now level five is the real deal this is

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,399
the cars that can drive all by

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,640
themselves without human intervention

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,480
and they can drive anywhere that a human

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,719
driver would be able to travel

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,399
alfred's team is responsible for

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,760
designing and developing

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,320
the features that ensure reliability and

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
ensure safety of this hardware which is

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,000
obviously a huge concern

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,440
he has degrees in both physics and

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,280
mechanical engineering and is also an

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,239
mba

31
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,920
we have been honored to have him as an

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,719
expert judge for the 2019 and 2020

33
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,159
hackaday prizes

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,240
please welcome to the hackaday remoticon

35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400

36
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,400
alfred jones

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,840
yeah i can't hear anybody

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,000
so i have to cheer myself on so i

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
apologize in advance

40
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
hi everybody i'm super excited to be

here uh um i can't wait

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,320
to share with you what's on my mind

43
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,240
about autonomous vehicles

44
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,439
and it's really great um first it's been

45
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,400
a crazy

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,720
day in the jones house and we've been a

47
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,880
lot of emotions going on

48
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,240
with what's going on in the world but

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,000
we're celebrating now and

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
now i'm celebrating with you so um

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,119
let's jump into it as i share

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,159
my screen right

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,280
here all right i want to talk to you

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,680
about autonomous vehicle hacking

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,320
specifically self-driving overview and

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
the design and development

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,799
for safety how do we do it why do we do

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,439
it

59
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,840
what is it first a little bit about

60
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,919
me uh my name is alfred jones

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,000
and i i like to consider myself a

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
product developer i love

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,760
making things i love making products i

64
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,840
hack in every aspect of my life whether

65
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,800
it's personal

66
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,160
or or professional um over the past 17

67
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,959
years i've made a ton of products

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,680
um that i'm very proud of from a slew of

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,720
different companies

70
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,080
uh starting with the first product that

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
i ever worked on was razer ii flip phone

72
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,959
back when the good old candy bar no

73
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,080
touchscreen

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440
was was all that there was um but now

75
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,519
as of late what i work on are autonomous

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,840
vehicles specifically for lyft

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,440
lyft is an american rideshare company

78
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,840
which mission is to improve the world of

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,280
transportation

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,200
and and really thinking about the future

81
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,280
of what rideshare looks like what

82
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,800
transportation looks like

83
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,680
in the future is it autonomous i don't

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,159
know

85
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,040
we might find out in this presentation

86
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,239
um

87
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,720
but before we get into it i want to give

88
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,560
you guys all some background

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,159
right we we talk about these different

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,640
levels mike even said level

91
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,360
five is the epitome of autonomous

92
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,000
vehicles

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,599
but how do we get to level five well

94
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,840
first we got to understand

95
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
that there are different levels and

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
there's actually six levels by the way

97
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,360
uh starting with level zero and within

98
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,879
those levels there are two

99
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,519
different pillars there's one that is

100
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,080
the

101
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,640
the driver monitors and drives in the

102
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,920
environment and the other one

103
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,400
is the autonomous um vehicle um

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,440
level one is what is pretty much every

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,959
single vehicle that was

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,519
been created ever since you know that

107
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,480
first vehicle

108
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,879
um probably even before ford motors even

109
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,680
had their

110
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
their vehicle but the model t all of

111
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,879
those those are level one

112
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,959
uh the car that we know and love and

113
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,879
what makes that level or level zero

114
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,799
excuse me what makes that level zero

115
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,920
is it is just completely driven by a

116
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,480
human

117
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,519
the human uh uses their eyes to see the

118
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,400
world

119
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,200
their arms to steer the car uh and their

120
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,159
feet to use

121
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,280
to press the gattle of the gas

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,920
uh but then there's level one level one

123
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,639
is where we

124
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,839
first start to assist the driver

125
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,040
uh the best example of level one is your

126
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,919
cruise control

127
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,880
now every car that is modern has a

128
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,000
cruise control

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
um and it's just simply you know setting

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,440
the speed but yet

131
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,840
you still have to drive the vehicle you

132
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,280
still have to see

133
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,960
what's on the road and you have to be

134
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
ready from a safety standpoint

135
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,479
to take over at a moment's notice

136
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
then there's level two level two now if

137
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
you have a level two car

138
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,240
i wanna be your friend because i wanna

139
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,520
drive in that car cause that's a cool

140
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,160
car

141
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,000
probably an expensive car and those are

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
the cars that have the driver's assist

143
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,479
where

144
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,960
um it will stop and break for you when

145
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,040
you're on the highway it will even steer

146
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
and keep in lane

147
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
but pretty much that's it so it's not an

148
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,280
it's not a

149
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,520
self-driving car it's a self-steering

150
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,960
self-stopping

151
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,479
uh and automatic go car

152
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,240
but then when we get to level three we

153
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,520
start to really

154
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,400
dive into what is autonomy and this is

155
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,440
the cool part

156
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,199
this is what we're starting to see today

157
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,960
brought to you by tesla and companies

158
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,720
like that where

159
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,520
now there is uh an autonomous there is

160
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,280
an autonomous mode that allows you to

161
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,479
take your hands

162
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,280
and your eyes off the road and think

163
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,320
about other things

164
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,639
however you know the driver must still

165
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,720
be engaged from a safety standpoint in

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,160
case something happens

167
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,240
uh typically even though that these cars

168
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,199
can do that

169
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,919
in these very controlled environments uh

170
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,919
you you re you really don't want to do

171
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:48,240
that

172
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,800
right you don't want to trust that type

173
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
of vehicle because

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,440
you know if something just kind of pops

175
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
up you'll

176
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,560
you'll lose control

177
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,280
then there's level four now level four

178
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,080
is when we're

179
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,319
really talking about autonomous vehicles

180
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,600
and this is the car

181
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
that i want to commute every day to work

182
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
in why because then i could

183
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,039
take a nap um or go to sleep now

184
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,919
the key unique thing about level four

185
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,680
and level four we're gonna talk a lot

186
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
about level four because level four

187
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,720
is really where the world is today and

188
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
that is the most obtainable level of

189
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,080
autonomous vehicles

190
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,240
why because what what you're creating is

191
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600
an autonomous vehicle

192
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,800
that could ride safely and reliably in a

193
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,440
certain

194
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
set of conditions uh we're going to talk

195
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,800
about those conditions but

196
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
those conditions could be you know on

197
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,400
the highway in certain

198
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,919
in certain cities or certain roads

199
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,639
but then there is the end-all be-all

200
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,199
level

201
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,360
five level five is the the top floor

202
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,440
it's the best you could be this is full

203
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,280
autonomy level five car

204
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,720
you don't even need a driver it doesn't

205
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,479
need an owner a car can drive around by

206
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,280
itself

207
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,840
the best way to think of level five is

208
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,120
artificial intelligence

209
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
full artificial intelligence why because

210
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,880
essentially what you're saying with a

211
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,319
level five car

212
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,120
is you're you're removing the human and

213
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,520
you're

214
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,160
putting in a different brain that can

215
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,800
think and react just like a human can

216
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
um and for those of you who drive and

217
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,919
i know nowadays a lot of us don't but

218
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,360
for those of you drive you know

219
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,840
if you're driving down the road and

220
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,680
let's say

221
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,199
god forbid a fly flies into your eye

222
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,520
you close one eye you can kind of squint

223
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,880
until you drive

224
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,599
to the side to get safe you know that is

225
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,639
the type of

226
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,039
safety reliability redundancy that you

227
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:41,759
want in

228
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,080
a self-driving artificial intelligence

229
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,560
at level five

230
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,520
so when we're really looking at an

231
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,280
autonomous vehicle this is what this is

232
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,639
what we're

233
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,039
experiencing right where all these

234
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:55,919
pictures that you see

235
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,479
you have these real life scenarios with

236
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,280
what you see

237
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,479
on the left side of the autonomous

238
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,000
vehicle scenario

239
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,759
there's there's cars there's people

240
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,440
there's bikers there's

241
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,599
there's pedestrian crosswalks there's

242
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,720
stop signs

243
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,400
there's traffic lights these are all

244
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,240
things that we take in account

245
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,960
as we're driving so how does an

246
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,680
autonomous

247
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,440
vehicle do it we all know how humans do

248
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,080
it so let's talk about that

249
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
um but before we talk about that i want

250
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,599
to make one thing clear

251
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,560
the road is crazy and believe it or not

252
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,319
that is somebody really driving like

253
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,039
that

254
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,120
um but it's very unpredictable

255
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,679
a lot of things can happen to a crazy

256
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,599
driver doing a

257
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,799
two two sided wheelie or

258
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,040
simple something as simple as road

259
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,360
construction that pops up out of nowhere

260
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,200
an autonomous vehicle in order to be

261
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,680
safe must be able to react safely in all

262
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,640
of these situations so we look

263
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,399
and think about the autonomous system

264
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,760
what we're really doing is

265
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,120
recreating the human uh that is driving

266
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,680
that car

267
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,920
and we're starting all the way on the

268
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,880
sense side

269
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,279
we're looking at how do we gather the

270
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,080
information

271
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,880
from from the environment from the world

272
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,200
right

273
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,320
from what we see what we hear maybe even

274
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,680
from what we smell

275
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,040
to kind of take that and then digest it

276
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,080
from uh in order to interpret

277
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,040
it and filter it and and make some data

278
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,920
choices

279
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
and then figure out what is the safest

280
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,040
course of action

281
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,360
before we initiate right and if you

282
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
think about how that progresses

283
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,800
essentially what we're doing is we're

284
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
sensing we're perceiving

285
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,440
we're deciding then we're acting and

286
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,680
that again is the eyes the ears

287
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,800
the brain or the body

288
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,959
which then breaks down into the hardware

289
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,279
portion which is where what i focus on

290
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,200
which are the sensors the compute the

291
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,800
power and the motion control

292
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,680
so the first thing when we peel back

293
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,399
that onion

294
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,160
of of sensors is we talk about cameras

295
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,640
now cameras are fantastic they have high

296
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,600
resolution

297
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
they're able to see and characterize a

298
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
lot of stuff um tesla

299
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,560
um has a has a self-driving system that

300
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
only uses cameras and cameras are great

301
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,360
especially if you have

302
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,680
stereo cameras because it allows you to

303
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,640
perceive

304
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,880
the environment and be able to tell what

305
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,000
different things are

306
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,839
it helps you from a lane keeping

307
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,680
standpoint it lets you determine

308
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,519
traffic lights and different types of

309
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,880
vehicles

310
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
there are stereo cameras that allow you

311
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
to kind of determine

312
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,839
distance but ultimately cameras are not

313
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,240
good

314
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,720
at determining the distance of things

315
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,399
again they're high resolution

316
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,880
they're low cost but distance is

317
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,600
something that

318
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,519
cameras are you can't really tell

319
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,839
because it's technically a 2-day image

320
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,279
and they're very sensitive to different

321
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,880
lighting conditions right if you drive

322
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,399
in somewhere that's pitch black that has

323
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:52,800
no

324
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,440
surrounded lighting and your dynamic

325
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,560
range is not

326
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
high enough you won't be able to use

327
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,640
those cameras but cameras are great and

328
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,240
cameras are used

329
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
there are there's another type of sensor

330
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,920
called lidar

331
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,399
lidar which is similar to a radar

332
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,279
doesn't use

333
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,480
radio waves it use light beams

334
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,720
and it projects light beams back and

335
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,920
forth right so

336
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,440
um for those of you who are not familiar

337
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,279
with a lighter it's a mechanical

338
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,079
sensor that spins a light around with

339
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:22,399
the

340
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,040
with a projector and catches that light

341
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,680
back

342
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,720
and creates this point cloud now

343
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,760
lidar are super fantastic they can

344
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,560
determine

345
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,000
the shapes and 3d objects very clearly

346
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,839
with very high fidelity

347
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,000
but they can't see things like like

348
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,560
color they can't see things like signs

349
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,360
they can't see uh the the markings in

350
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,720
the road

351
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,079
um and lidars are extremely

352
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,480
high cost and and high and low

353
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
reliability why because they're

354
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
a moving type sensor um

355
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,160
and then there's the good old radar uh

356
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,000
radar which uses

357
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,279
uh radio waves to detect objects are are

358
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,000
great

359
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
in a lot of different conditions

360
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,160
especially when you can't see

361
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,839
you have no visibility uh if there's fog

362
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,800
there's they're really fantastic in um

363
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,200
but

364
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,320
they're very low resolution right radar

365
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,440
can't pick up small

366
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,440
objects radar does not see the fine

367
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,079
shapes uh of an object right they what

368
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,040
they see

369
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,079
are you know blocks and they determine

370
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,120
that to be an object

371
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,200
and another bad thing about a radar is

372
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,639
they're very noisy

373
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,839
radar unlike a lidar or

374
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,320
a camera they're not a beam of light

375
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,639
they're not a straight line radar create

376
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,639
creates this radio wave effect that

377
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,839
creates a lobe

378
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,079
which can couple and ground different

379
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,240
types of materials and surfaces

380
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
right so that radar uh is very

381
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,079
uh dependent on the the vehicle

382
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:00,959
positioning

383
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,519
uh what's around it um the interference

384
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,920
from other different radar or

385
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,720
in a scenario bouncing off of signals if

386
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
you go through a tunnel

387
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,360
so what i'm getting at is all of these

388
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,480
sensors are great

389
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,399
in some ways but they're not great in

390
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,079
other ways right

391
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,880
here's here's a side-by-side comparison

392
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,360
of all three sensors now

393
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,760
mind you there are other sensors that uh

394
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
some autonomous vehicle companies use

395
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,880
such as sonar

396
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,600
and um and other types of lasers but

397
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
these are the primarily the three

398
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,720
most important sensors um but if you

399
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,240
notice if you look at this graph you'll

400
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,360
see a common trend

401
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
right whereas where one is weak in one

402
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,240
category it is strong in another

403
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,839
um um which a different sensor is able

404
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,440
to compensate for

405
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,480
um a really good example of

406
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
a bad situation is this is a lidar point

407
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,320
cloud

408
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,000
and you can tell because of the fidelity

409
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,399
of all of the objects there

410
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,279
and that the in that those blue dots

411
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,880
that are in that circle

412
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,920
that is smoke smog coming

413
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,199
out of that uh um rv's

414
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,399
exhaust pipe now when the vehicle it was

415
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,240
riding around in this scenario it

416
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,839
stopped because it did not know what

417
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,360
that object was

418
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,279
but what we've since done is trained the

419
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,880
object to work with the camera and the

420
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,519
radar

421
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,399
to cross-reference that that that

422
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,440
phenomenon

423
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,839
and what we call this is sensor fusion

424
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:32,639
so everybody

425
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,680
is doing this now uh um waymo

426
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,440
cruz um zooks what have you

427
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,680
where you take lidar you take camera you

428
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,480
take

429
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,120
radar and you put them in a

430
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
constellation around your vehicle

431
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,680
in a way that they work together this

432
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,760
ultimately allows you to really

433
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
understand your environment now you can

434
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,600
say with confidence that

435
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,240
this is a car that's a bike this is how

436
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,760
the lane is turning

437
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,000
um and and working all together and the

438
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
most important thing is safety safety

439
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,560
safety

440
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,639
right you want to make sure that when

441
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,720
this vehicle is riding on the road

442
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,959
if if if you or i were walking across

443
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,320
that street i want to make sure that

444
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,560
that vehicle knows that i am a human

445
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,079
walking across the street and it should

446
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,240
react accordingly

447
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,680
so those are sensors um but the funny

448
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,760
thing about sensors now as i said before

449
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,440
the difference between level four and

450
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,519
level five is level five

451
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,560
is artificial intelligence right now you

452
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,040
and i

453
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,079
as artificial or real intelligent people

454
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,680
um compared with an artificial

455
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,360
intelligence you would not

456
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,560
need to understand uh an environment

457
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,720
in order to drive in in it before you

458
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,320
got there whereas

459
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,600
at level four um in order for an

460
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,120
autonomous vehicle to

461
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,079
to work in an optimal way it needs to

462
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,440
understand the environment

463
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,839
and the more data that we can provide

464
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,560
for it

465
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,600
the better can understand the

466
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,040
environment and this is something called

467
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,000
mapping

468
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,079
and mapping is something that uses a

469
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,560
whole bunch of different types of maps

470
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,519
to create an autonomous av map uh and

471
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,000
one of those

472
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,399
maps those maps look like google maps

473
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,240
those maps are maps created by

474
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,279
lidar and camera um and those

475
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,040
maps are also maps that are they're

476
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,839
created by autonomous vehicle companies

477
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,839
to create scenarios right so they'll

478
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,000
take the maps and project

479
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
what is a proper route on a road what is

480
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,920
what is a proper

481
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,279
stopping pattern where are the

482
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,600
crosswalks and it will train its

483
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,639
autonomous vehicle

484
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,399
on these maps these maps are very

485
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,079
important and what we do

486
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,720
is we use machine learning with tons of

487
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,240
tons of mapping data

488
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,720
in order to understand and determine how

489
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,680
do we react

490
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,000
to the environment and way we build

491
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,199
these maps

492
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,839
are is actually quite clever a lot of

493
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,519
times if those of you have seen an

494
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,279
autonomous vehicle driving around

495
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,079
uh here in california we have um an

496
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,800
autonomous vehicle company called zoox

497
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,399
and our n waymo and also us and a lot of

498
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,000
times when we're driving around without

499
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,240
passengers we are mapping the

500
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,119
environment

501
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,199
in order to understand it better in

502
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,559
order to understand what is the

503
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,000
frequency of traffic

504
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,480
what is the frequency of pedestrians how

505
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,199
are they

506
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,280
maneuvering and then we take all of that

507
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,799
data um

508
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,039
with these maps using our machine

509
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,240
learning algorithms

510
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
to further predict what

511
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,359
uh what the autonomous vehicles should

512
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,840
do uh in these settings

513
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,919
and that's what we do with mapping and

514
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,000
essentially it ends up looking like this

515
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,559
right

516
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,200
where you have this scene scenario it

517
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,640
breaks it down into

518
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,000
what are the different lanes and how

519
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,160
everything works and then the machine

520
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,720
learning

521
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,120
coupled with the sensors predicts where

522
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,080
are the vehicles

523
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,200
going in this scenario it's actually

524
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,320
pretty amazing stuff um

525
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,160
i every time i ride in an autonomous

526
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
vehicle and i i see this happening i

527
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,679
just can't believe it

528
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,880
uh but this is a great example of

529
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,280
you know all of this working together

530
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
sensors sensor fusion

531
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,080
machine learning and mapping what you

532
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,400
see

533
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,679
here is uh in the middle is an

534
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,679
autonomous vehicle that is writing down

535
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,720
a trajectory down a already mapped

536
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,039
lane um and what you what you're also

537
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,880
seeing are in these boxes

538
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,360
are different objects where you see

539
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,440
parked cars you see this big parked

540
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,720
truck right there that start

541
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,559
comes up in purple uh there's a

542
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,840
pedestrian walking

543
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,320
uh and that yellow box right there but

544
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,760
the most important thing

545
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,600
that's happening is this red box

546
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,799
and in conjunction with that green

547
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,240
then purple bigger box right

548
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,799
there's a biker two bikers actually

549
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,600
biking

550
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,559
alongside of the autonomous vehicle and

551
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,559
what you'd notice and if you and i were

552
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,320
driving and we saw these bikers coming

553
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,000
and you also saw that truck in front of

554
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,320
you

555
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,440
you might say hmm i might want to slow

556
00:18:59,440 --> 00:18:59,919
down

557
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,039
at this point to let these bikers pass

558
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,400
and that's exactly what's happening

559
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,640
right so the vehicle predicted

560
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
that these bikers will go in this

561
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,000
particular route and it

562
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,080
stopped and that barrier that you see

563
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,760
right there is kind of like

564
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,320
a safety barrier check it's like okay

565
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,080
something's about to happen here

566
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,280
stop perceive

567
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,679
decide okay keep going and that's what's

568
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,360
happening it's it's pretty fantastic

569
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,240
stuff

570
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,360
super cool um motion control

571
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,200
uh hardware so now let's dive a little

572
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,640
deeper into the hardware that makes this

573
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,280
work

574
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,960
uh the stuff that like really gets me

575
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,280
excited um motion control

576
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,240
um is are the set are the control

577
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,280
control units

578
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,600
that we use in order to control how does

579
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,440
the vehicle stop how does it start

580
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,679
how does it break and the engine right

581
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,360
so it's it's very important once you

582
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,440
design your computer with your sensors

583
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,000
to be able to control that vehicle

584
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
vehicles nowadays

585
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,360
our vehicle companies nowadays are

586
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,200
designing their vehicles in a way that

587
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,320
it's it's more easy easy to tap into the

588
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,240
motion controls already of a vehicle so

589
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
you don't have to custom design your own

590
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,480
uh you still should in order to limit

591
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,679
your latency

592
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,320
uh and and ensure your safety but

593
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,919
ultimately you want to make sure that

594
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:14,400
your

595
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,840
your your vehicles are road compliant um

596
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,440
and anything that you put on the road it

597
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
has to be road worthy to the point where

598
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,120
you don't want something to fail while

599
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,799
it's driving down the road 80 miles an

600
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,000
hour that would be catastrophic

601
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,240
when we think about the design process

602
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,600
you might have heard i kept saying

603
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,720
safety safety safety safety safety is

604
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,600
is the mantra when when anybody's in the

605
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,280
in the automotive industry

606
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,679
um but i think even more so in the

607
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,919
autonomous industry because now

608
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,520
we are putting our lives in the hands

609
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,320
of a robot so when we're thinking about

610
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,080
it from a hardware perspective

611
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,480
also from a software perspective but uh

612
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,200
we want to think safety safety safety

613
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,280
and in conjunction with that safety we

614
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,640
think reliability

615
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,200
scalability and serviceability why why

616
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,600
do we think those is because well

617
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,559
if you an autonomous vehicle especially

618
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,480
for rideshare is more

619
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,640
more like um a bus or an airplane

620
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,039
an airplane where you want to make sure

621
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,880
that you can quickly service it if

622
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,080
there's a part that doesn't work you

623
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,400
could take that part off put it back on

624
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,760
go through your checklist and make sure

625
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,600
it's safe and then put it back out there

626
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,760
um especially if it's something that is

627
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,360
for rideshare

628
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,440
and then lastly there's this huge lift

629
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,679
logo here for those of you don't know

630
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,159
uh if you can't tell by the color choice

631
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,280
of the logo

632
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,760
we are very festive at lyft and we

633
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,480
really

634
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,799
think about the customer experience

635
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,760
whenever we

636
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,360
are doing any type of product conception

637
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,039
or any type of design work

638
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,520
so that's something there that that i

639
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,559
really instill

640
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,799
a mantra in my teams to really think

641
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,640
about the product experience and how do

642
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,799
we design our autonomous vehicles

643
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,280
so that they're approachable and fun and

644
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,960
not intimidating

645
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,280
because we want people to really embrace

646
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,919
it and not shy away from it

647
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,960
so diving a little deeper into

648
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,120
the design process i wanted to share

649
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
this with you all

650
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,039
um because this is something that is

651
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,200
very near and dear to my heart

652
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,159
um in every product that i i do and this

653
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,640
is something that is important um

654
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,600
from for any fellow creator hacker

655
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,240
designer

656
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,679
builder engineer uh this is

657
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,919
the wheel of success this is our design

658
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,200
process right

659
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,400
whenever we have um

660
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,480
an idea or or a requirement or a goal

661
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,679
it starts off as a problem and it enters

662
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,720
into this

663
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,480
sickler loop where we we analyze and

664
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,320
and we do design work right when that

665
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,840
design work could be

666
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,880
you know on an uh on a napkin uh that

667
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,200
analysis could be a hand calc but

668
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
ultimately you you create some prototype

669
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,760
and then you

670
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,919
build something and then you test that

671
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,440
test test test

672
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,320
testing is the most important thing that

673
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,400
any builder

674
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,159
any hacker any engineer should embrace

675
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,520
because that's just what makes us better

676
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,440
we want our our

677
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,559
things our hardware our ideas to fail so

678
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,440
we can then

679
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,080
improve and evaluate that and do more

680
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,720
research

681
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,440
to prototype and test and improve and

682
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,080
research

683
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,919
but ultimately it will give you a

684
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,280
solution

685
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,559
now the thing the caveat with this um is

686
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,720
you know the the

687
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,320
best is the enemy of good um and a lot

688
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,520
of times you want

689
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,559
your product to to be the best

690
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,159
but you have to find that happy medium

691
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,919
so you can get to a solution

692
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,120
uh and and ultimately by understanding

693
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,200
your project tenants like safety

694
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,679
reliability serviceability and scalable

695
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,440
um you will be able to exit this circle

696
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,400
um with a solution that gets you a

697
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,960
really

698
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,799
really fancy looking autonomous vehicle

699
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,360
over there i might say

700
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,919
um history of the autonomous vehicles

701
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,520
that i've worked on

702
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,240
with my team at lyft it always starts

703
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,279
off with

704
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,320
a pretty janky prototype right how do

705
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,120
you just

706
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,279
get to a basic understanding as quickly

707
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,159
as possible

708
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,080
and that's what you see all the way here

709
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,840
at our alpha car

710
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,760
and then we've iterated along the way

711
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,000
with our beta and our beta plus plus

712
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,760
and unfortunately i'm not able to share

713
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,600
with you our fourth generation

714
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,159
which we uh just yesterday we did a

715
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,600
marketing photo shoot with

716
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,039
so we will be sharing it with the world

717
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,120
but it is literally the best autonomous

718
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,719
vehicle i can't wait till you all see it

719
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,679
but our design process our detailed

720
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:52,880
design process

721
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,320
is really really dives into

722
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,799
all of the things that make automotive

723
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,480
aerospace and product design

724
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,039
it's best and we bring people engineers

725
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,000
from all those

726
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,240
different industries to custom design

727
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,120
and build

728
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,679
all of our hardware from scratch with

729
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,480
exception of the vehicle

730
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,640
there's a lot of different approaches uh

731
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,240
the way that we do it is we choose to

732
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,600
modify the vehicle

733
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,799
in in such a way that it will be um

734
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,559
safe reliable and autonomous an analysis

735
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,840
and test

736
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,600
analysis and test is something that is

737
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,880
very important

738
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,919
um and we do all of this in-house

739
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,200
at uh with my team where we look at

740
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
things virtually and empirically we

741
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,120
understand all of the fluid dynamics of

742
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,159
things

743
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,520
thermal is something that is extremely

744
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,559
challenging when

745
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,440
designing it for anything automotive

746
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,240
especially

747
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,360
autonomous why because processors and

748
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,400
compute gets

749
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,520
very hot cars get very hot they're solar

750
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,240
loading

751
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
if you if you ever sat in a car in the

752
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,919
desert uh in the summer

753
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,840
you know what i'm talking about but

754
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,720
there's other things you have to

755
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,440
consider

756
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,279
like rain snow and sleet salt water so

757
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,400
forth and so on so

758
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,000
when you're designing these things it's

759
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,679
not as straightforward as just slapping

760
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,960
something on and going

761
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,840
not if you want to scale something up um

762
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,559
in order to

763
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,279
provide a product for rideshare but

764
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,320
ultimately

765
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,760
it starts with a design right again

766
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,679
like i said when thinking of an

767
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,919
autonomous vehicle you want to think of

768
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,919
how do you make something that is

769
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,600
approachable how do you

770
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,080
maintain a design language so you're

771
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,600
telling a story

772
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,440
with your product as opposed to just

773
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
having just an ugly vehicle that

774
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,480
drives itself right anybody can do that

775
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,600
but can they

776
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,039
make it in such a way that um

777
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,080
is appealing to to passengers

778
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,840
and pedestrians um some more fun facts

779
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,400
about

780
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,720
what my team does we do all of this

781
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,520
in-house

782
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,559
we design we build we test and we have a

783
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,840
pretty cool

784
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,840
laboratory where we work on our vehicles

785
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,360
so super excited to share that with you

786
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,559
um and ultimately that's lift i'm going

787
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,720
to skip over this last slide

788
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,080
and jump to question and answer

789
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,200
um thank you for your time i i hope you

790
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,679
guys enjoyed it as much as i did

791
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,760
um mike do you have any any fun

792
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,399
questions for me

793
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,039
yes absolutely it uh thank you so much

794
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,200
that was a wonderful keynote uh alfred

795
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,000
and um i was really just thinking about

796
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,919
what it takes for your team to take a

797
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,039
vehicle

798
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,240
and not add the sensors but actually

799
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,640
make

800
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,200
the the actuation part of it happen so

801
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,360
can you just plug into the can bus

802
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,039
of an existing vehicle and do the

803
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,600
steering acceleration braking

804
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,960
shifting that you need to for the

805
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,480
vehicle or are you altering those

806
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,679
systems

807
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,799
yes that's a great question um so not

808
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,960
only do we have to alter those systems

809
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,200
uh in a functionally safe way by the way

810
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,240
uh we also have

811
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,080
we also add our own motion controls to

812
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,520
be able to um

813
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,919
have a much better latency and control

814
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,360
over those sensors

815
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,520
um without getting into too much

816
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,640
proprietary

817
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,480
you you want to make sure that those

818
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,039
buses um and whatever motion controls

819
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,640
that you add to the vehicle

820
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,200
you know talk to your system um as

821
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,840
quickly

822
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,399
as possible possible and safely but we

823
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,240
also add redundancies in there

824
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,600
um in an effort to uh

825
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,320
to to make sure that it's safe uh while

826
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,960
driving on the road

827
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,279
i also think a lot about uh the sensors

828
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,640
that you have in the vehicle

829
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,480
and like characterizing those like for

830
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,840
instance if you get in the car at the

831
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,120
end of night after staring at this

832
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,200
computer screen you might notice like oh

833
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,799
i can't see as well as i normally do

834
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,480
because my eyes are tired or

835
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,159
you might get into a heavy rainstorm and

836
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,600
be like i need to slow down and make

837
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,720
sure that this is

838
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,919
uh this is safe so um in making sure

839
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,360
that the sensors that you have

840
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,840
on your system are in the top working

841
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,720
order

842
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,360
that you expect them to is it different

843
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,480
you know is it already a solved problem

844
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,080
like aerospace has sensors and they know

845
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,000
how to make sure that they test those

846
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,440
or is it are there new problems here

847
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,200
with lidar and more advanced sensor

848
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,159
fusion

849
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,000
yeah yes uh fantastic question

850
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,760
it is not like aerospace it is not a

851
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,000
well-oiled machine it is still

852
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,360
very much in development um you know

853
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,080
sensors need to be recalibrated very

854
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,279
frequently

855
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,360
um and one of the challenges to scaling

856
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,960
up an autonomous vehicle is how do you

857
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,760
do that

858
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,559
in such a way that your your vehicle can

859
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,000
either recalibrate itself

860
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,120
or it's more effortless um

861
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,080
uh so i mean to answer your question

862
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,880
we're creatively developing ways to to

863
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,640
work on that to improve that to make

864
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,760
sure that they

865
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,960
they they work well with the envy

866
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,679
with the vehicle but then also uh so

867
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:58,720
your design works well

868
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,320
vehicle to vehicle the vehicle in the

869
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,000
same exact way

870
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,919
right so so it is a challenge i don't

871
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,159
have a as precise answer because we're

872
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:06,559
still

873
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,799
working on that but uh right now what

874
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:09,679
what most

875
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,640
companies do is you know very often they

876
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,360
calibrate their

877
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,159
vehicles frequently um it's kind of like

878
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,279
how i refer to

879
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,600
um the airplane check right before you

880
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,480
go

881
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,720
on a flight or when you land you know

882
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,080
you you uh

883
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
check your your your instruments and

884
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,840
what have you um

885
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,520
calibrating a vehicle checking your

886
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,760
vehicle for safety uh before you go

887
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,919
out very regularly is very similar at

888
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,720
this stage

889
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,000
so it i liked your explanation

890
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,360
of um how you know we have

891
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,919
these sensors that are trying to fill in

892
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,120
for the human senses

893
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,880
and it seems you know like it's hard to

894
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,720
build an android right and you're

895
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,679
basically

896
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,520
building an android to be able to sit in

897
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,120
this driver's seat and drive this thing

898
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
um which makes me think that all of our

899
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,919
roads have been designed for humans

900
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,120
to operate on and so

901
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,880
do you see a future of roads that are

902
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,200
designed for robots as a possibility

903
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,039
you know in order to get us to the point

904
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,399
where self-driving

905
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,039
can be proven before we take that huge

906
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:13,679
step

907
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,240
yes robots being anywhere yes definitely

908
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,200
i do

909
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,240
um i think uh that

910
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,919
is a huge step that societies will

911
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,279
have to embark on uh once they once the

912
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,000
value

913
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,320
of autonomous vehicles are realized i

914
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,360
think

915
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,880
uh putting uh autonomous

916
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,200
indicators and markers and uh on the

917
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,360
highway is probably the first step

918
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,720
one of the first types of autonomous

919
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,640
vehicles you will start to see

920
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,159
um uh are are within our

921
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,360
our freight delivery right uh doing an

922
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,200
autonomous vehicle on the highway

923
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,600
is is the easiest form of autonomous why

924
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,679
because it's it's very consistent

925
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,640
uh it's it's a long trajectory it is a

926
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,080
constant speed

927
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,120
um so if we are able to

928
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,519
um help our our infrastructure in

929
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,960
getting product from one

930
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,559
end of the country to the other side or

931
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,159
where wherever you are

932
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,880
um uh you can easily see the investment

933
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,279
the return on investment by putting that

934
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,559
infrastructure into

935
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,720
like a highway system but then the next

936
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,640
step would be the cities

937
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,159
right cities might want to

938
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,559
not only they might want to change out

939
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,919
their their street lights

940
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,640
um in an effort to have radio sensors on

941
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,360
them so

942
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,880
not only will the camera be able to

943
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,039
detect that it's yet red yellow or green

944
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,720
but maybe it emits a signal

945
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,440
that says okay it's red yellow or green

946
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,240
and that will be

947
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,679
very um very appealing to cities because

948
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,360
again

949
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,200
we're in my company we're making

950
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
vehicles for rideshare right so

951
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,519
um you're helping people maneuver around

952
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,640
the cities

953
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,960
limiting pollution limiting streets uh

954
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,919
city congestion

955
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,279
if you're by eliminating the amount of

956
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,519
vehicles that are there right so i'll

957
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,519
i guarantee we'll see more and more

958
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,039
stuff like that but

959
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,360
the industry has to converge on what

960
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,480
those things are

961
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,960
right before before they just start

962
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,000
popping up and

963
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,760
i really think they'll start with

964
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,039
highway transportation first

965
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,159
i think the last question that i have is

966
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,000
one about manufacturing

967
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,480
um and i hope this isn't a short short

968
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,919
question but

969
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,000
uh it seems like automotive industry is

970
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,279
already set up for

971
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,760
manufacturing at scale are there any

972
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,720
real challenges

973
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,039
once um you know problems of what

974
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,559
sensors should we use how should we do

975
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,679
the sensor

976
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,159
how should we stitch everything together

977
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,559
is it going to be difficult to scale up

978
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,799
self-driving manufacturing or do we have

979
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,200
the resources in place for it

980
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,039
uh great question um once there is an

981
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,559
architecture

982
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,039
that is proven it will be

983
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,679
as easy for the automotive industry to

984
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,760
scale it up as it is any other vehicle

985
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,039
it will take time but essentially the

986
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,079
the part that we do uh in

987
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,239
in tech is really accelerate the

988
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,520
development of

989
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,079
the technology and really figuring out

990
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,040
what is the best

991
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,719
architecture in order to make a

992
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,079
self-driving vehicle

993
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,399
now in the presentation i talked about

994
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,839
lidar radar

995
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,119
and camera being a really efficient

996
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,520
sensor fusion which it is however if we

997
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,719
look at the radar

998
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,879
which is very expensive and very it's

999
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,000
low reliability

1000
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,199
it is not the most optimal thing to put

1001
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:35,679
in

1002
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,079
every single vehicle because you'll have

1003
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,599
a high failure rate especially

1004
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,040
statistically as you

1005
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,239
increase the amount of volume um

1006
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,199
also it's a lot of moving parts and it's

1007
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,879
very expensive right

1008
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,760
the cheapest radar lighters are you know

1009
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,280
tens of thousands of dollars

1010
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,480
um so um i think

1011
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,760
the industry as a whole needs to um

1012
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,560
figure out the right system that will

1013
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,520
safely work

1014
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,599
in the right environments in order for

1015
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,920
the car companies to have that blueprint

1016
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,320
in order to manufacture now companies

1017
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,680
like waymo

1018
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,040
um have partnered with um

1019
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,040
with fca um cruz has pro

1020
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,560
partnered with gm so the auto industry

1021
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,440
is already

1022
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
trying to figure out how do we adapt to

1023
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,640
this technology

1024
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,960
but again the tech needs to be figured

1025
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,800
out first and i think there's a lot of

1026
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,079
different bets being played

1027
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,800
elon musk is a is a very

1028
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,200
firm believer that this can all be done

1029
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
with cameras

1030
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,560
and if you are able to do with cameras

1031
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,680
let's say you can do with cameras and

1032
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,720
just radar and

1033
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,119
most car or a lot of cars these days are

1034
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,800
starting to incorporate your radar

1035
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,880
uh then you can really create a system

1036
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,800
that is very cheap

1037
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,200
and reliable um but then how do you do

1038
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,079
that safely

1039
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,359
i think if we had cameras and radar in a

1040
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,240
vehicle

1041
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,160
with these sensors in maybe the street

1042
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,400
or street lamps and what have you i

1043
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,520
think uh

1044
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,520
we would be able to greatly accelerate

1045
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,440
that architecture that autonomy that

1046
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,640
automakers can make

1047
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
but again you know you still want to

1048
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,680
make sure it's safe

1049
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,200
um it will be

1050
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,040
a little while before we actually

1051
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,800
determine what safety

1052
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,640
is and we're getting there we're

1053
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,760
learning um

1054
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,320
but i i i'm very excited to see what's

1055
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,400
happening in the world of autonomy

1056
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
and i i can't wait until all of you get

1057
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,839
to drive an autonomous vehicle because

1058
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:40,720
it is

1059
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,759
absolutely awesome

1060
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,680
i like how you put that uh wait until we

1061
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,920
all get to drive an autonomous vehicle

1062
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,839
it's like if you think about i'm gonna

1063
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,280
hang up the phone

1064
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,640
right that used to mean something you'd

1065
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,160
literally hang up the phone or like i'm

1066
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,359
gonna roll down

1067
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,320
my window yeah my car and so it'll be

1068
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,960
fun

1069
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,440
to put the nail in i'm gonna drive the

1070
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,320
car

1071
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,560
and have that be an antiquated phrase

1072
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,760
alfred jones

1073
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,839
thank you so much for all of your time

1074
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:08,960
we really appreciate you giving this

1075
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,200
keynote i found it very inspiring to

1076
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,839
find out

1077
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,599
uh the very difficult engineering

1078
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,119
problems that people are facing

1079
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,480
that are very new to uh you know society

1080
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,520
to figure out

1081
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,119
and to see that very competent and

1082
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,880
inspiring people are the ones working on

1083
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,920
them thank you

1084
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,359
thank you very much thank you for having

1085
