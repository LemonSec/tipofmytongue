1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,319
[Music]

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,279
all right so

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,920
we are super excited uh kelly and yuri

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,320
uh

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,080
and myself uh have been working with

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,799
hackaday to formulate this particular

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,080
workshop for weeks now we have given

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,359
talks previously but never really

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,080
conducted

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,320
a workshop and never definitely

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,840
conducted a workshop

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,760
virtually so this is going to be a very

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,560
interesting 2020 experiment

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,800
before we start introducing ourselves

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,800
i'll just set the agenda for today

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,079
uh today we are going to you know

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,079
introduce ourselves who we are what we

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:36,480
do

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,040
uh some of our you know background story

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,239
uh then we'll talk about

21
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,239
tools um like what tools you will need

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,760
today and what tools

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,320
you know you uh are optional we'll talk

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,920
about a little bit about uh soldering

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,440
techniques

26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,239
and then we'll jump on to the actual uh

27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,760
sculpture of the day which is going to

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,320
be a

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,239
firefly we'll be presenting three

30
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,360
different ways

31
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,399
that you can take on this project with a

32
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:00,960
simple

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,640
uh no circuit uh

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,960
template that yuri will be presenting

35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,880
then kelly will be presenting

36
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,280
uh her take on the firefly which is you

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,320
know has a

38
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,600
a stable uh

39
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,159
and then i'll finish up with a simple

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,360
triple five based

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,840
uh firefly and then you know after the

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,880
first 30 minutes

43
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,119
we'll jump on to the actual workshop

44
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,400
that will last 90.

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
remember this workshop it's not a

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,520
competition it's not a

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,439
race to finish your sculpture it's more

48
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,799
about interacting with us

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,880
understanding what the techniques are

50
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,320
and just you know having a good time

51
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,000
so as far as introductions go i'm mohit

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,759
my last name if you are unable to

53
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,439
pronounce it's boyete

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,720
i'm a senior hardware engineer at

55
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,560
particle so my day job is literally

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,880
building circuit boards

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,560
which talk to the internet dev boards um

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,840
stuff like that but in my free time

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,719
i like to unwind by continuing to solder

60
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,280
but uh

61
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,719
not on pcbs but using uh brass

62
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,360
as my primary media so i have been

63
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,560
building these sculptures for a few

64
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,280
years now

65
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,160
my foray into sculptures started with

66
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,560
beam

67
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,760
robotics uh as a teenager but i've taken

68
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,160
on

69
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,200
uh like more challenging and interesting

70
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,239
uh projects as i moved along i've

71
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,440
learned to incorporate wood copper

72
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,319
brass as my uh to go materials

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,280
i like to play

74
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,120
like a toy maker at times by designing

75
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,319
sculptures that have

76
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,440
uh personalities um

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,519
you know by using simple uh seven

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,200
segment displays or oleds

79
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,400
um they're very boxy very square edged

80
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,480
i'm not comfortable doing uh

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,800
the organic looking sculptures that yuri

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,879
and kelly are you know experts in

83
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,920
so uh you know being able to express

84
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,519
emotions you know having just a

85
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,720
thermometer for example this is a

86
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,239
thermometer that instead of

87
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,920
telling you what the temperature is it's

88
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,680
expressing uh you know by changing its

89
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,319
color

90
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,480
you know showing emotions um and stuff

91
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,840
like that

92
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
uh my background is robotic so i also

93
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,120
like to use

94
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,800
robotics and building sculptures you

95
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,560
know this particular one was built

96
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,760
purely out of brass and pre-formed

97
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,640
that allows me to paint with light you

98
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,760
know if you take a long exposure

99
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,599
photograph

100
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,599
you can actually you know create

101
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,680
patterns in thin air

102
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,519
in addition to doing sculptures i also

103
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,560
love dabbling in

104
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
cat design and 3d printing just the fact

105
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,239
that we live in a world where you have

106
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,040
access to

107
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,080
3d printers and pcb manufacturers

108
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
you can literally you know build a

109
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,480
product start to end

110
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,840
sitting at your armchair here

111
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,400
so enough about me uh let's see uh we

112
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
have kelly and yuri today uh kelly will

113
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,519
introduce this first

114
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,239
followed by yuri and then we'll go on to

115
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,519
the actual workshop

116
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,120
kelly thanks uh hi everybody

117
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
i'm kelly heaton and uh thanks so much

118
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,519
for joining us today

119
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,680
um so just a little background on me i

120
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
am an artist and i make circuits because

121
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,000
i'm fascinated by the lifelike qualities

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,399
of

123
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,918
electronic hardware and also that

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,440
biological organisms are very

125
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,960
machine-like

126
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
so i'm going to start with an overview

127
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,919
of my work in circuit sculptures you

128
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,520
have a sense for my background and i

129
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,960
also want to point out a couple of

130
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,720
techniques that can inspire your own

131
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
practice

132
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,080
so my career in sculpting with hardware

133
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,680
dates back to the late 90s

134
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,800
when i focused my graduate thesis on the

135
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
creation of a digital artist palette and

136
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,880
a system of reconfigurable what i call

137
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,000
physical pixels at that time the field

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
of artistic

139
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
software was exploding and i really

140
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
wanted to take part in it

141
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,840
but i didn't want to make graphics on a

142
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
flat computer screen

143
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,000
um i wanted my electronic art to be

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,720
sculptural

145
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:10,960
uh hence physical pixels

146
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,919
so from there i moved on to sculpting

147
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,320
with

148
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
popular animatronic toys like furby and

149
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,479
tickle me elmo

150
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,320
left is an image of the sculpture that i

151
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
made with engineer stephen gray

152
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,600
it's called cool and then it's got 400

153
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,240
repre

154
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,759
programmed furby's embedded in the

155
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,600
surface and they

156
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,000
uh react to you so they mirror your body

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
in furby

158
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,520
and on the right is a giggling quivering

159
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,840
coat that i made from 64 used tickle me

160
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,479
elmo's that i trapped on ebay

161
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,840
if you want to learn more about either

162
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,600
of these projects you can check out my

163
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,680
reflection loop from 2001 and

164
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,440
live help from 2003. before i move on i

165
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,720
just want to point out if you look at

166
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,039
the electronics inside of the elmo cove

167
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,280
you can see that i use clear heat shrink

168
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
tubing to hold everything together

169
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
heat shrink tubing is a great material

170
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,318
surface culture

171
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,240
so since that time i've designed and

172
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
built a lot of different circuits that

173
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,039
blank lights move around

174
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,639
and they sound and i've mixed them with

175
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,479
traditional media like drawings and

176
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,360
paintings

177
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,880
because i want to make visual art that

178
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,639
feels like it's alive

179
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,400
um these are images from my show the

180
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
parallel series from 2011

181
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,400
on the left is a pedagogical

182
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
illustration of an analog

183
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,240
motion detector and on the right is a

184
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,080
detail of a hybrid circuit painting

185
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,199
called resisto

186
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,440
ergo sum in which i built my

187
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,360
self-portrait and resistors and use

188
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,759
blinking leds to look like synapses or

189
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,840
thoughts circling my head

190
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,440
the image on the right is a great

191
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
example of the usefulness of what's

192
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,680
called

193
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,160
thevenin's equivalent for making circuit

194
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,520
sculpture

195
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,280
thevenin's equivalent states that any

196
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,759
combination of linear electronic devices

197
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,120
such as resistors

198
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,880
connected in series in parallel will

199
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
function as a single device

200
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,560
in this case like a single resistor so

201
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,080
with linear components you can make

202
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
something that looks very complex

203
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,840
but is electrically simple

204
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,599
i've also made large as in human scale

205
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,599
sculptures of electronic components the

206
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,440
image on the left is a detail of a giant

207
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,599
resistor modeled after honeybee

208
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,680
and the center is an npn transistor

209
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,840
lifting its emitter leg to become a

210
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,599
diode and on the right

211
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,840
is uh a five foot tall ceramic capacitor

212
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,280
if you want to know more about why i

213
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
made these giant electronic devices you

214
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,560
can check out my book

215
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
uh pollination from 2015 it's on amazon

216
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,120
and kindle format

217
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
so i sculpted numerous sound and light

218
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,080
generating generating insects because i

219
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,680
love the way they look and sound when

220
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,800
you have enough of them to make a

221
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,120
landscape or a soundscape for example

222
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
in the upper left-hand corner i made a

223
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,639
kinetic sculpture of electronic bees

224
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,560
with tiny pager motors and mechanical

225
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,840
springs

226
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,360
the nice thing about metal springs is

227
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,960
you can use them as part of your circuit

228
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,639
and they're still bouncy and move

229
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,319
elements in space

230
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,840
um also shown are two different

231
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,280
approaches i've taken to making

232
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,120
electronic mods

233
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,280
the white moth in the lower left corner

234
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,440
is entirely electronic

235
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,879
built from printed circuit boards that

236
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,560
are shaped like wings

237
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,160
and the yellow moth has a circuit board

238
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,080
body but fabric wings

239
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,879
um both of these flutter leds using a

240
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,840
shift register

241
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,599
and if you want to see video of that you

242
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,199
can check out my moth

243
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,840
electrolyr sculpture from 2018.

244
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,240
so i want to show you one additional

245
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
approach to sculpting delicate things

246
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,919
like insects and leaves and that's to

247
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,080
use flexible printed circuit boards

248
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,240
if you look at the image on the right

249
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
the orangey yellow color that you see on

250
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,640
the moth wings is flexible pcb

251
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,320
that i directly soldered through whole

252
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,680
components to

253
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
um you can use surface mount parts

254
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,880
obviously for a more

255
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,600
delicate look but i really like how

256
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,519
through hole components have a real

257
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,360
you know an anatomical vine like

258
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,519
um almo they can almost use to depict

259
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,519
like fields of energy you can sculpt in

260
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,200
space which is cool

261
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,519
um on the left i used a flexible pc

262
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,760
substrate as well uh to make leaves that

263
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,920
i later painted with transparent acrylic

264
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
to change the color

265
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,240
and i etched all these flexible pcbs

266
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,120
myself

267
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
which is why i painted it but you could

268
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,959
also have a shop do this for you

269
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,160
and um anyway so yeah all the um

270
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,240
pcbs that you see in this slide generate

271
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,399
some combination of light and sound and

272
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,240
if you want to hear or see that you can

273
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,399
check out my electro ears

274
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,320
and also my hackaday project called

275
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,640
hacking nature's musicians that's also

276
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,839
from 2018.

277
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,000
so more recently i've started to sculpt

278
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,320
analog electronic songbirds this one is

279
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,200
from 2019. if you're interested to hear

280
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
my songbirds and learn how they work you

281
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
can check out a presentation i gave last

282
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,000
week on deep

283
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,120
fake bird song i love how electronic

284
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
sculpture can create a distinctly

285
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,640
biological aesthetic that suggests

286
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,880
electronic devices do in fact have a

287
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,760
life of their own in early 2019 i made

288
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,600
this sculptural bird for the hackaday

289
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
circuit sculpture competition

290
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,440
and i just wanted to point out the way i

291
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,600
made the birds form and that was to use

292
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,320
uh water-based clay and then i wrapped

293
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,240
resistors around it what's great about

294
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,560
that

295
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,480
is it's super cheap and easy to just

296
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
like make like a basic form and put your

297
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,360
components around it it won't burn

298
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
obviously you do need to leave a seam

299
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
somewhere so you can slip your sculpture

300
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
off the clay before you finish

301
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
but by that point it has enough

302
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,839
structure to

303
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,040
to be stable on its own and also notice

304
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,120
i use thevenin's equivalent here too

305
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,440
uh because the entire big bird is one

306
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,279
giant resistor from an electrical

307
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,480
perspective

308
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,800
um there are a few more parts that uh

309
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,839
make this like

310
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,920
in the wire nest make it chirp and sing

311
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
a little bit like a baby bird but

312
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,839
uh basically mostly just the evidence

313
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,640
equivalent

314
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
so to wrap up here right now i'm really

315
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,399
into etching and screen printing circuit

316
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,839
boards which we won't be talking about

317
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,519
today but i just wanted to show you this

318
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,360
you have a sense for who i am

319
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
i love the print circuit medium if you

320
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,120
want to talk to me about it

321
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,839
um and i continue to design new analog

322
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,600
electronic circuits that have lifelike

323
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,640
qualities

324
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,120
i'm also working on a master controller

325
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,560
for my different circuits so i can

326
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,120
sequence them and make soundscapes

327
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
anyway just so you know if you want to

328
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
ask me about that but anyway

329
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
for uh that's it for now i'll turn over

330
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,279
the stage to yuri

331
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,519
hi everybody i would like to welcome you

332
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,000
to this workshop as well it's really

333
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,120
exciting

334
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,680
uh i am yuri prowse and i am software

335
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,880
engineer and a maker

336
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,079
from czech republic i made my first

337
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,720
sculpture two years ago and i was

338
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,000
inspired by

339
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,680
mohit void work here so thank you

340
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,880
and i totally fall in love with it

341
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,279
you know it's not only a way to create

342
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,600
uh something unique and beautiful

343
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,920
but it's also pretty challenging because

344
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,959
you need to have

345
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,760
a wide spectrum of skills and techniques

346
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,920
from metalworking woodworking

347
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,959
hardware to software engineering and

348
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:17,680
that's

349
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,319
pretty fun

350
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,040
uh in the past two years i've created

351
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,160
about around

352
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,279
uh 20 different sculptures

353
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,399
more importantly i teach others how to

354
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,480
make these on their own by writing and

355
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,959
instructions and shooting the tutorials

356
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,519
i would describe my work uh as an

357
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,360
engineering art

358
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
as you can see it's symmetrical

359
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,120
functional clean and a minimalistic

360
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,639
design

361
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,360
i mainly work with leds and light

362
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,399
effects

363
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,079
and warriors sensors to create

364
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,959
some unique user experience for example

365
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,399
the heart at the bottom

366
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,680
reacts to your pulse or

367
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,720
the led ball on the left top

368
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
is controlled by the gyro and each

369
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,480
project for me

370
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,959
means a new challenge i need to learn

371
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,920
new technique

372
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,880
new material new sensor new hardware

373
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,320
that's what makes it fun for me

374
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,760
we live in wonderful age hardware is

375
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,880
pretty cheap

376
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,760
uh and it's easy to obtain uh you can

377
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,240
create

378
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,480
anything you can imagine i always wanted

379
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,320
to have for example

380
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,959
a game boy that i owned when i was a kid

381
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,480
so i grew up

382
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
a development board and a display and

383
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,839
created it the best way i know how so

384
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,480
with the brass and the brass wires as

385
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,079
you can see here

386
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,720
i also create they uh use the same

387
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,360
technique

388
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,720
on my uh arduino you know clone

389
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,440
which is uh through which you can see

390
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,519
that you can see through it

391
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,240
um and this was the first time i used

392
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,360
epoxy resin

393
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,320
casting here again super exciting and

394
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,880
super fun

395
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,800
but so far i would say my most famous

396
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,279
and most complicated artwork is this

397
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,800
every blooming flower

398
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,839
it combines electronics and mechanics

399
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,040
if you touch the leaf the petals will

400
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,040
startly will slowly start to open

401
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,160
and i made this one for my wife as a

402
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,680
valentine's day gift

403
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,800
and it went viral and since then a lot

404
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,160
of people asked me

405
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,120
uh how to make a copy of it or even if

406
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,760
they can

407
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,120
buy one so i recently decided to found a

408
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,959
company called floover

409
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,560
dedicated to handmade these flowers

410
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,160
so you can go and check

411
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,839
floor.io and see how these are really

412
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
beautiful

413
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,399
if i should describe the key difference

414
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,360
between me

415
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,720
mohit and kelly i say it's

416
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,760
this intricate 3d templates i make for

417
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,519
my sculpturing work

418
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,639
they help me to achieve a perfect

419
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,160
symmetry perfect shape uh they are my

420
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,120
third

421
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,160
fourth and fifth hands while soldering

422
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,160
they are like perfect when you need uh

423
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,440
several identical parts for example

424
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,959
the same six leaves for petals for

425
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,600
for the flower itself

426
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,800
and last but not least i make these

427
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,279
lighting jewelries which i originally

428
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:47,920
designed it

429
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,360
for a workshop like this uh they only

430
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
have two components

431
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,079
leds and coins of battery so they are

432
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,720
that simple to make anybody can make

433
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
these even without knowing anything

434
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,240
about electronics

435
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,680
i currently have around 30 designs

436
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,639
and all of these templates are available

437
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,480
for download on my website so make sure

438
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
to check them out

439
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,399
and i would love to show you how to make

440
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,800
these on this workshop

441
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,759
so this is me uh there's definitely more

442
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,600
i could talk about

443
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,480
so check out my instagram twitter or

444
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,360
youtube

445
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,680
to find out more about my or about

446
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,360
myself about me

447
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,079
and my work and of course feel free to

448
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,920
reach me

449
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,560
so thank you very much and uh let's

450
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,079
start with the workshop itself

451
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,479
right

452
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,600
thank you so much yuri um it's amazing

453
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,199
to see that uh

454
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,160
the kind of styles usually and being

455
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
able to bring that to this workshop well

456
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,680
thank hackaday once again

457
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,519
uh for you know pushing us to

458
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,959
collaborate and come up with this

459
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,000
workshop

460
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,759
um so before before we move on

461
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,519
should we let people ask us a few

462
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,360
questions while we're here as presenters

463
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,000
we can answer

464
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,280
them or should we what do people think

465
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,359
absolutely i think people are asking

466
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,439
questions uh let's see uh and take the

467
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,720
first round of questions here

468
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,679
um the workshop will be available later

469
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,160
um

470
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,119

472
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,079
the presentation slide deck and the

473
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,000
templates um schematics

474
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,160
are all available on the remote econs

475
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,280
circuit sculpture

476
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,919
uh webpage so you can start downloading

477
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,440
the whole presentation right now if you

478
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
would like to

479
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,640
we will be sharing the links the links

480
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,000
are already on to the

481
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,440
on the hacker days webpage i'm powering

482
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,240
these with

483
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,039
lipo batteries back here um

484
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,679
yes you are all muted for the time being

485
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,080
um the job what will happen

486
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
what will happen you guys is we're going

487
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,440
to leave presentation mode after we go

488
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,120
through the tutorials

489
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,799
and then you're going to pick a table

490
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,320
and we will move around between the

491
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,840
tables and then you can actually talk to

492
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,559
us on video

493
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,600
exactly awesome

494
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,799
um so all right we can keep taking uh

495
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,480
questions because i think we'll cover

496
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,240
the first 30 minutes with presentations

497
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,640
and

498
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,559
uh after that we'll dive into the

499
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,080
workshop followed by

500
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,640
you know us actually starting to build

501
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,600
things

502
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,039
uh so before we get started uh today

503
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,559
three things you will need and you know

504
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,160
for your future projects is a soldering

505
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,000
iron solder flux

506
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,880
uh a pair of pliers uh flush or diagonal

507
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,919
cutters

508
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080
today's skills only requires basic

509
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,840
soldering skills um you don't need to be

510
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,440
an expert in you know surface mount

511
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,160
devices

512
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,120
uh or anything intricate you can keep

513
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,160
things simple

514
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,080
basic understanding of electricity

515
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,400
electronics is uh valuable but not

516
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,120
required

517
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,799
and immense amount of patience remember

518
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,320
if you're trying to do this

519
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,240
for the first time it is going to take

520
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
time uh you have to be careful not to

521
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,880
burn yourself

522
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,600
um you know the battle scars are not

523
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,120
something to be proud of

524
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,480
when you're doing these things um so

525
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
in terms of uh what kind of soldering

526
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,840
iron do you want

527
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,640
i would say 50 watt or higher that is

528
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,600
something needed

529
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,360
when you're soldering brass or other

530
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
heavy heavier gauge metals

531
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,320
so that it has enough thermal mass to

532
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,640
keep

533
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,960
the joints heated temperature control is

534
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,400
always nice depending upon what you're

535
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,360
using

536
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,480
uh i highly suggest use brass wool uh to

537
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,039
keep the

538
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,400
tip clean in between joints um the flux

539
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,559
oxidizes uh pretty fast and so you want

540
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,440
to make sure

541
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,400
you know you keep the tip clean in terms

542
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,240
of solder itself

543
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,000
i personally like using leather solder

544
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,280
and i've just invested in a bunch of

545
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,200
solder that i use but only for my

546
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,320
personal projects

547
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,600
at work we tend to use lead free if you

548
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,559
are choosing

549
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,200
either make sure that it's water soluble

550
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,840
um

551
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,240
just makes your job of cleaning the

552
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,840
joints easier later with just you know a

553
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,960
toothbrush and

554
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,159
water in terms of flux you can use a

555
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,679
flux paste or a flux

556
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,679
in a liquid from that can come from a

557
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,120
like a squeegee bottle

558
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,400
or a pen like this if you are using a

559
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,679
paste make sure that you clean uh the

560
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,440
joints after this because sometimes

561
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,919
these fluxes will eat into your metal

562
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,280
after you're done soldering uh

563
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
these two are my favorite tools that i

564
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
use every day uh for

565
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,440
uh my sculptures uh it's made by a

566
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
company named zuron

567
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,039
which is based out of the united states

568
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,880
they make really cool uh

569
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,600
pliers and diagonal cutters my favorite

570
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,720
thus far is the

571
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,679
zoron 9100 up that has a retainer clip

572
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,120
so after you clip something

573
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,000
uh the leads don't go flying off it is

574
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,280
held within the

575
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,080
within the cutter i'll show you uh later

576
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,760
as we progress as to what that actually

577
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,520
means

578
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,600
in terms of materials i know we talked

579
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,799
about brass

580
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,320
quite a bit today and you know kelly

581
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,880
presented using the actual electronic

582
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
components themselves to create

583
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,840
structures but brass is not the only

584
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,400
thing but let's start with brass

585
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,679
we suggested using 0.5 millimeter or 0.8

586
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,360
millimeter brass rods

587
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,400
the reason is brass rods if you buy a

588
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,919
brass card it's pre-straightened so you

589
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,760
don't have to you know straighten them

590
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,960
if it's a wire they come pre-packed uh

591
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,559
some of the vendors here in the state

592
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,039
sides

593
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,000
are kns metals their base of chicago ace

594
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,559
hardware

595
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,360
you can buy them and most hobby stores

596
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,559
also carry them

597
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,200
uh be mindful if you were to go to

598
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,400
michael's and you buy

599
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,200
like a jewelry brass that it sometimes

600
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,120
could be aluminum wire coated with brass

601
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,720
so you want to make sure that's uh

602
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,880
actually brass wire we'll also learn how

603
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,000
to convert a brass

604
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,559
wire into a rod so that you don't always

605
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,440
have to have a

606
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,159
brass rod but brass is not the only

607
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,159
medium uh recently i discovered

608
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,760
uh that copper which i don't personally

609
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,520
use but i'm looking forward to using can

610
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,000
also be

611
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,120
used to create sculptures uh it's softer

612
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,600
uh

613
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,000
slightly more malleable than brass it's

614
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,440
a little difficult to work with

615
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,960
but as you can see here i'm using the

616
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,480
example of tonno here

617
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,520
who makes beautiful sculptures using

618
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,600
copper as their primary uh medium

619
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,280
if copper is not available you can use

620
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,000
music wire or tin plated steel

621
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,039
uh you can use brazing rods or silver

622
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,880
coated steel

623
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,720
and stuff like that you cannot use

624
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,120
aluminum uh stainless steel

625
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,080
or metals like those for soldering so if

626
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,159
you stick to these uh and the gauge is

627
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,120
usually between 18 to 20 are the right

628
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,960
um

629
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,320
right gauge to do this uh sculptures

630
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,400
here is an example of eric who makes

631
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
beautiful

632
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,720
sound sculptures uh i just like to see

633
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,280
how

634
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,039
the material you choose actually you

635
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,640
know makes your sculpture

636
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,919
uh look like in the end so there is no

637
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,280
heart and possible that you have to use

638
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,880
brass today or you know whatever

639
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,240
um you use any material that is

640
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,919
available to you

641
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,159
let's see how does one work with brass

642
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,120
again this brass

643
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,480
i'm using it as an example because

644
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,159
that's my primary medium but that

645
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,000
doesn't mean you have to use it the

646
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,760
techniques that we will talk today

647
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,080
also apply to other materials um

648
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
including copper

649
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,480
and tin plated or silver plated uh rods

650
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,440
uh it's almost therapeutic uh when you

651
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,840
hold

652
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
a piece of brass rod a brass wire and

653
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,360
start bending and cutting it you know

654
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,919
it's

655
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,640
again this is not a uh the competition

656
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,159
uh the idea is you know you have a nice

657
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,120
little afternoon

658
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,039
break here and you know you know you cut

659
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,559
this brass wire

660
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,279
shape it it's almost uh meditative to be

661
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,720
able to do this

662
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
so take your time uh work with the

663
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,159
material every material will have its

664
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,360
own personality

665
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,480
they'll some some will be resistive uh

666
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
some won't be and so work with the

667
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,799
material you have understand it

668
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,760
um the way uh this is my personal uh

669
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,640
approach

670
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,760
to forming shapes is basically i mark

671
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,720
the brass rods with a graphite pencil

672
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,080
the reason why i use graphite pencil it

673
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,559
doesn't

674
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,240
mark the brass and you can rub it off

675
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,320
with your fingertips if you were using a

676
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,400
sharpie you can use you know acetone or

677
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,039
other solvents to clean it but a pencil

678
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:15,600
works

679
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,279
just great um so first step you know you

680
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:19,760
mark

681
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,919
using a paper template this can be

682
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,039
printed or

683
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,960
hand drawn or you can use something else

684
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,159
like a clay

685
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,640
or a measuring tape to measure it second

686
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,200
tip

687
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,720
you know you basically cut it and this

688
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,279
is where the

689
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,919
diagonal cutters shine because most of

690
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:36,799
you know

691
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,240
after this step what's going to happen

692
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,640
the other end is going to go shoot off

693
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,480
and strike your eye or somebody else's

694
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,919
eye but

695
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,760
not with these regenerator clips they

696
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,440
will stay with you

697
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,279
so extremely valuable to invest in the

698
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,760
right tools especially if you have kids

699
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,720
pets or other things that you need to

700
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,120
protect

701
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,240
one minor detail here is every cut is uh

702
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,799
different

703
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,640
so you'll have one side is flush the

704
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,320
other side is like

705
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,880
like cut in a wedge so depending on what

706
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,600
intricate

707
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,200
shapes are you're farming this may or

708
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,720
may not be important

709
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,360
next step is bending again very

710
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,880
therapeutic try to use

711
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,919
a flat and uh needle nose pliers if

712
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,559
you're using serrated ones they will

713
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,360
mark your brass rods and you know uh the

714
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,799
results won't be as

715
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,919
clean so a flat nose needle plier would

716
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,919
be the way to go

717
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,159
and then as you work with the materials

718
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,279
like i have

719
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,520
gotten good at bending things at right

720
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,039
you know just like a 90 degree angle

721
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:39,679
just because

722
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,520
you just visually know the amount of

723
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,880
pressure you apply is

724
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,320
you know what kind of angle it's going

725
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,960
to create be patient go back and forth

726
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,640
these materials are very forgiving in

727
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,200
terms of

728
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,360
how you bend them and form angles

729
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,880
next up is soldering how do you solder

730
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,440
this if you know how to solder like

731
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,240
electronics

732
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,840
this should be just as uh

733
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,760
straightforward i usually like to put

734
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,440
masking tapes to hold the things

735
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,039
together yuri

736
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,279
and kelly will talk about their methods

737
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,799
of you know holding

738
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,520
materials down on a template but the key

739
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,039
element here is after you

740
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,600
you put these down make sure that these

741
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,080
don't have any stresses so don't

742
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
bend them against their will because as

743
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,000
soon as you solder it and take out the

744
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,039
masking tape

745
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,679
it's going to be deformed um so you know

746
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,679
make sure that your hands are relaxed as

747
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,960
well as the materials that you're

748
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,520
working with

749
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,799
are also in a relaxed state

750
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,200
apply a dab of flux this is critical for

751
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,919
a clean

752
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,840
um and proper joint uh i remember in the

753
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,200
past i

754
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
ended up making a lot of cold solder

755
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,799
joints because i was using

756
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,000
the right flux or the right temperature

757
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,799
but using the flux will you know be the

758
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,400
most important thing you will do while

759
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,080
making sculptures

760
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,720
except solder uh again soldering is

761
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,640
pretty straightforward i keep my

762
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,159
soldering iron around 700 degrees

763
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,880
uh you can work depending upon the gauge

764
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,000
of the brass or the material you're

765
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,279
using you might want to adjust

766
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,000
that temperature once you form this

767
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,600
solder joint you'll see there's a little

768
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,039
bit of discoloration that happens from

769
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,039
applying heat

770
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,559
and this this this is uh a common

771
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,039
problem but has a very easy solution all

772
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,799
you do is use a

773
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,240
fine uh grade steel wool and just you

774
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,840
know brush it off

775
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,399
and it will result in a very clean matte

776
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,440
looking solder

777
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,279
try doing this with every solder joint

778
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,880
if the area is accessible you don't want

779
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,120
to be

780
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,320
applying the wool after the sculpture is

781
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,520
done

782
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,679
you can at this point also try to wash

783
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,120
it off

784
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,480
if you want to uh before uh

785
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,760
i i mentioned that you know you can use

786
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,799
wires

787
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,399
as sculptures elements and if you want

788
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,559
to straighten them it's a very easy

789
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,240
straightforward technique to do that is

790
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,600
by using

791
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,039
a drill chuck this normal

792
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,000
hand drill will work great all you do is

793
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,880
take your

794
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,919
brass wire usually around 18 to 20 gauge

795
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,039
half hard or you can use copper

796
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,399
make a small loop at the end

797
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,039
feed it into the drill chuck and hold

798
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,159
the other end

799
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,159
with pliers and just you know apply the

800
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,720
twist you'll notice that after about

801
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,000
you know i usually count to 10 seconds

802
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
uh after that time period has passed the

803
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
twisting action actually straightens the

804
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,039
wire

805
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,279
into a straight rod and at this point

806
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,720
you know you can start using this in

807
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,559
your sculptures re-bend them

808
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,159
reshape them in the ways you want

809
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,159
so for today's sculpture we're super

810
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,159
excited that we'll be uh

811
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,080
making something that was inspired by

812
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,520
nature

813
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,240
which is a firefly and there are so many

814
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,520
possibilities uh

815
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,520
to go about this but we'll be presenting

816
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,159
a few options for you to give it a try

817
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,640
with and without electronic circuits

818
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,520
with or without

819
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,039
templates you can take this far in

820
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,279
you know you can have your own version

821
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,240
of it there's no

822
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,720
right or wrong way to do this and to

823
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,000
help us uh

824
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,799
through our first version of this fire

825
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,320
reply um i'll let

826
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,520
yuri uh present uh the next section of

827
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,320
this tutorial

828
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,000
well he'll be talking about how to make

829
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,159
beautiful fireflies out of leds and coin

830
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,480
cells

831
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,200
you're muted yeah i forget my for my

832
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,240
mikon

833
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,360
so i will share my screen in a minute

834
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,799
so you can jump on it jump on it

835
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,399
and here we go

836
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,360
so just confirm that you can see my

837
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,000
presentation

838
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,240
here

839
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,080
all right can you confirm that you can

840
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,159
see my presentation just it's yep

841
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:04,960
fullscreen

842
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,159
okay perfect so

843
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,440
uh as might introduce it uh we are going

844
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,240
to make

845
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,279
a nature inspired sculpture

846
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,159
or a firefly and i would like to

847
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,360
introduce my technique how i

848
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,720
uh create it as you can see on the

849
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,320
right image uh don't start soldering

850
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,039
right now

851
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,399
uh we will be here and this tutorial is

852
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,360
available

853
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,760
on the hegeday page so you can download

854
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,640
it later

855
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,399
and we will answer questions and help

856
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,760
you with

857
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,399
it if you decide to go with this

858
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,760
approach

859
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,960
okay so moving on

860
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,799
i always or not always but usually

861
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,919
i start uh on a computer i

862
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,440
sketch a raw shape to determine a

863
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,039
dimensions

864
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,640
of my art piece i went through

865
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,240
uh several iterations here so this is uh

866
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,480
the final result this is the final

867
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,840
template

868
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
uh the firefly actually was a huge

869
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,360
change for me because i'm

870
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,960
more into abstract shapes and

871
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,519
abstract shapes than animals so it was

872
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,200
quite a challenge

873
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,279
as you can see you can clearly recognize

874
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,760
my style symmetrical

875
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,080
clean and minimalistic designs and

876
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,320
straight lines

877
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,000
yeah i'm an engineer so

878
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,960
then when i have the template ready i

879
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,039
print it on a paper

880
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,799
and i can start

881
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,360
to actually making uh the sculpture

882
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,960
the real magic here is in using

883
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,799
a double-sided tape i put it

884
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,720
on the sculpture itself over

885
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,919
over the lines so

886
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,720
the double-sided tape will be my second

887
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,200
and

888
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,080
third and fourth and fifth hand while

889
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,039
soldering

890
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,519
the piece together if you don't have

891
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,039
double sided tape

892
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,240
you can use a normal tape and tape over

893
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,960
the wire instead of putting the wire on

894
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,240
the top of the

895
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,480
of the tape but using double sided tape

896
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,360
is like

897
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,679
pretty amazing and really quick and

898
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,320
comfortable

899
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,320
so this is how how the template looks

900
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,679
when when the tape is applied and it's

901
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:38,640
fully covered

902
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,200
with a double-sided tape so now it's

903
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,799
time to move

904
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,080
to actually start bending and working

905
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,440
with wire uh you need to take your

906
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,880
time your time here uh don't be quick

907
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,600
about it

908
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,799
play with it as much sets it's uh

909
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,320
really fun to work with wire

910
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,760
to create a shape out of it

911
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,519
for example here i've started with the

912
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,799
head so i

913
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,120
bend the wire with with the round pliers

914
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,399
to make a perfect radius for

915
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,519
for the for the head of the firefly then

916
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,279
i cut it

917
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,080
to the exact size and put it on the

918
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,039
template

919
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,200
if you now hold the template in your

920
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,120
hand

921
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,799
if you have lift the the paper

922
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,480
the wire will not fly away so

923
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,840
that's why i'm using the double-sided

924
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,279
tape

925
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,320
and now i start this slow to

926
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,279
create the other parts of of the

927
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,799
sculpture so i start

928
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,080
with the left wing i measure the bend

929
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,840
on the wire i bend the wire to precise

930
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,559
angle double check it with the template

931
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,279
and then

932
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,559
cut it with the pliers

933
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,919
with the cutters sorry uh as you can see

934
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,039
i didn't continue the bend here uh

935
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,599
to the bottom side of the wing because

936
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,560
bends over

937
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,079
90 degrees are hard to make

938
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,320
and then they doesn't look nice they

939
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,760
have instead of

940
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,679
a sharp edge they have the round edge

941
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,079
which

942
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,359
i don't like that much so i rather

943
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,040
cut the wire here and continue with

944
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,480
another one

945
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,639
uh it have a drawback because you will

946
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,679
have a joint

947
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,520
in there and i'm more like when

948
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,879
there are bends so you know you need to

949
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,320
uh to make compromise somewhere

950
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,599
uh okay so now i startly start filling

951
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,440
the template

952
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,159
the left wing

953
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,240
and now the right wing

954
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,119
so it's pretty easy just cutting we're

955
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:57,920
just measuring

956
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,520
and cutting the wire sometimes

957
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,440
you don't uh cut the wire to

958
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,440
the correct size at the first time so

959
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,359
you throw it away and start with another

960
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,800
one

961
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,520
you know don't don't be quick about it

962
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,440
take your time

963
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,119
so this is the basic

964
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,119
shape of my firefly

965
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,000
pretty easy right

966
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,960
okay so now comes the hard part

967
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,880
and it's actually making it an

968
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,640
electronic circuit

969
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,320
uh i'm fancy using smd

970
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,440
components i'm using the biggest one

971
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,480
which are 1206

972
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,880
smd leds they come in various

973
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,440
colors you can even get blinking leds

974
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,960
and fading leds

975
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,280
so they make really nice light effects

976
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,320
if you are not comfortable with the smd

977
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,560
component you can use two holes like

978
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,359
this as well

979
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,280
there's no difference at all just the

980
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,599
size

981
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,960
uh basics to the electronic of the leds

982
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,119
i hope you are all familiar with the

983
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,040
basics of the electronic circuit

984
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,440
the current needs to flow in order to

985
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,640
circuit to work

986
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,760
in this case uh to light

987
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,800
the led uh lid have

988
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,880
two leads the positive fleet which is

989
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,720
called anode and the negative fleet

990
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,400
which is all cathode

991
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,480
and as you can see on the sma id on the

992
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,200
bottom

993
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,240
there is this little arrow that shows

994
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,440
how the current flows so the negative

995
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,640
lead

996
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,520
is where the arrow is pointing so this

997
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,480
is

998
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,880
like critical you need to know where is

999
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,400
the positive and negative fleet

1000
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,800
otherwise the led will not work

1001
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,240
so i take my tweezers and

1002
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,760
place leds upside down on

1003
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,760
the template why i put them upside down

1004
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,200
because assembly leds have the pads

1005
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,680
on the bottom so in order to make a

1006
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,560
solid joint

1007
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,920
you need to solder them upside down

1008
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,240
that's how it is

1009
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,839
as you can see i am using negative fleet

1010
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:28,800
negative

1011
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,480
lead of the led negative is connecting

1012
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,079
to the outline of of the firefly so

1013
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,200
i choose that the outline of the firefly

1014
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,560
will be a negative wire of the sculpture

1015
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:51,280
as you can see detail here

1016
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,640
uh so now i can this the fun can start

1017
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,359
finally

1018
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,000
i will solder all the joints together i

1019
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,480
first

1020
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,599
apply the flux to all the joints and

1021
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,480
then start

1022
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,920
slowly soldering individual joints

1023
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,760
the double-sided tape has a little

1024
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,359
drawback

1025
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,839
if you overheat your wire

1026
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,920
the glue on the double-sided tape will

1027
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,359
stop being sticky

1028
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,720
and the the wire will

1029
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,640
will got loose so make sure not to

1030
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,160
overheat your piece

1031
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,920
uh it's also good to not overheat it

1032
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,280
because

1033
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,800
then the joint will not look nice and

1034
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,720
the wire will start to change color

1035
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,240
so this is how the joint should look

1036
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,040
like nice

1037
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,560
evenly flat no no no blobs

1038
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,240
at all if you apply enough flux and

1039
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,800
not not too much heat this is how it

1040
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,119
will look like

1041
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,320
so this is the final uh shape

1042
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,000
of the firefly and now for the final

1043
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,400
step

1044
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,160
is to powering it as i said previously

1045
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,640
this is the dead simple circuit it only

1046
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,320
contains two components

1047
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,040
uh the coin battery cell and leds you

1048
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,000
might wondering

1049
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,200
why there is no resistor at all

1050
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,880
and it's a little nasty trick the

1051
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,839
uh this kind of this kind of coin

1052
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:20,800
battery

1053
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,119
has its own internal resistance so it

1054
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,560
won't allow

1055
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,079
uh too much current through the circuit

1056
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,440
on its own so the leds are safe

1057
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,200
in this circuit it's a nasty trick but

1058
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,040
it works and it makes it very simple

1059
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,160
okay uh you now need to

1060
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,560
make sure the battery will hold in place

1061
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,200
and this is

1062
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,560
our positive wire so connecting to the

1063
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,640
other side of the leds

1064
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,119
uh this is the first 3d band the most

1065
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,880
complicated event

1066
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,839
in my sculpture

1067
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,079
in order to to make sure the battery

1068
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,319
will hold

1069
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,079
enough in the sculpture i need to also

1070
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,240
solder the wire on the front of the

1071
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,760
firefly

1072
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,960
but you know if you if i solder the wire

1073
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,079
directly to the outline the circuit will

1074
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,280
shortcut

1075
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,839
so i need to add another two leds on the

1076
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,839
front

1077
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,040
so this is how the final sculpture looks

1078
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,760
like

1079
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,560
as you can see there is a positive wire

1080
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,359
connecting

1081
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,160
all the positive leads of the leds and

1082
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,839
negative wire connecting all the

1083
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:38,960
negative

1084
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,359
uh negative leads of the led

1085
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,240
so the circuit should probably work we

1086
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,359
will see

1087
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,560
yay it works

1088
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,359
that's this is like the perfect moment

1089
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,160
when you see

1090
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,240
it finally work it finally uh shines

1091
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,440
okay so now it's time to be creative

1092
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,040
because you exhausted

1093
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,200
all the possibilities of of the paper

1094
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,079
template

1095
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,800
so for example i started to work out of

1096
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,240
the template

1097
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,960
and this is the most fun i started to

1098
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,520
adding

1099
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,560
lags and other things to the sculpture

1100
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,359
so it looks

1101
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,520
more natural not just the flat design

1102
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,240
i usually at the end clean it with

1103
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,280
alcohol

1104
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,400
i'm using api

1105
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,000
so it makes it makes it gets you rid of

1106
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,440
the flux

1107
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,960
and also i'm using this ultrasonic

1108
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,599
cleaner it nicely polishes

1109
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,839
the brass wire at the end so this is the

1110
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,119
final sculpture i also added

1111
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,160
the small brass plates

1112
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,720
at the end to make the ring cases so it

1113
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,160
looks more

1114
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,119
like a firefly okay so i hope

1115
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,440
you explain to people how you got the

1116
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,040
eyes at an angle

1117
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,440
okay so you mean this slide

1118
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,640
right uh yes yeah so

1119
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,760
you i i just i took a pliers

1120
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,560
and took uh tweezers sorry tweezers i

1121
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,520
took tweezers

1122
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,240
and led and take my time and trying to

1123
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,040
get the leds into the right position

1124
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,560
so there was no template for it

1125
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,599
you can use a little

1126
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,960
piece of wood or any material

1127
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,400
to help you hold all the led

1128
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,480
in the correct position but i just use

1129
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,640
tweezers in this case

1130
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,079
because it was a simple solution

1131
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,880
i made i made it for it took several it

1132
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,800
took me several iterations because i

1133
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,000
don't get the angle and i don't get the

1134
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,720
angle

1135
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,839
right at the first several times

1136
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,280
so again you need to be patient

1137
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,319
you need to be um

1138
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,040
sorry what's the board never mind you

1139
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,480
need to take your time to

1140
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,520
to to make it right

1141
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,640
so i will i will uh help you

1142
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,720
to the workshop if you will

1143
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,280
okay so this is

1144
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,960
for my paper template technique

1145
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,240
as you can see the result is

1146
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,119
quite nice and i'm sure you will be able

1147
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,200
to create a similar design

1148
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,240
the template is available on the

1149
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,119
record a page or as well as the

1150
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,880
presentation itself

1151
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,440
thank you very much thank you so much

1152
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,079
here that is beautiful um i just love

1153
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,040
how like alive that particular thing

1154
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,400
looks and especially the

1155
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,440
six leds that you use in the back

1156
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,599
are like probably anatomically correct

1157
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,640
as well

1158
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,760
wonderful now that you have seen uh

1159
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,880
yuri's way of building things um you

1160
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,160
know it's his own style

1161
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,839
his own uh way of making sculptures that

1162
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,520
i've you know come to admire over the

1163
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,079
years there is another way

1164
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,240
you can go about this and i think uh in

1165
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,839
the community we call it

1166
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,040
uh free-forms ordering um and kelly i

1167
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,319
feel like is the master

1168
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,560
in that where she's able to use organic

1169
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,240
shapes and arms to create these

1170
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:28,800
beautiful

1171
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,599
uh circuit elements um she has requested

1172
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,640
me to uh

1173
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,520
present for her while she will um you

1174
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,640
know twice

1175
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,200
she has a poor internet connection so i

1176
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,079
will present

1177
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,400
her slides and she will take it away

1178
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,760
thanks mother uh gary check out the chat

1179
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,680
i tried to answer everybody's questions

1180
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,839
for you but um

1181
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,800
yeah before before you start

1182
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,160
presentation

1183
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,480
if you i think the better format for the

1184
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,640
question is the q and a section on the

1185
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,599
right because

1186
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,560
your comment won't get lost in the chat

1187
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,240
as it flows away

1188
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,400
so if you think you have something

1189
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,359
important to ask

1190
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,640
just put it in the q a section

1191
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,160
go ahead click okay sure um yeah so

1192
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,640
uh the the point of us providing you

1193
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,000
with different approaches

1194
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,599
actually is that when you do get to the

1195
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,160
workshop stage you can mix and match all

1196
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,119
of this and we

1197
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,119
you know we really want you to feel like

1198
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,800
you can try different techniques so you

1199
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,040
don't have to just make yuri's firefly

1200
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,440
or just make mine or just make mojito

1201
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,040
it's it doesn't matter we're just trying

1202
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,200
to show you some different strategies

1203
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,160
uh so uh what i'm going to be talking

1204
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,880
through is

1205
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,200
is how to make one of these little guys

1206
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,280
and just like what yuri did

1207
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,720
there's really you don't need to know

1208
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,960
anything about electronics to do this

1209
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,359
um because you're not building uh well

1210
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,880
you are building a functional circuit

1211
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,440
but in a very basic way so i'll show

1212
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,119
show you before i get started this is

1213
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,119
this is the firefly illuminated here

1214
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,480
with my light it's kind of hard to see

1215
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,599
that but

1216
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,760
anyway um and what i'm going to point

1217
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,839
out to you at the end which is an

1218
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,319
option uh we also uploaded this to the

1219
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,440
project page

1220
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,760
but if you separately breadboard this is

1221
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,599
an oscillator it's an a stable

1222
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,119
multivibrator circuit

1223
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,920
and the schematics are all for uh there

1224
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,960
for you guys

1225
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,880
um who want to do this either

1226
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,040
either freeform or in your breadboard of

1227
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,880
course i can't i mean my reading glasses

1228
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,400
there we go

1229
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,680
anyway if you build an oscillator

1230
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,640
then your firefly will blink uh and for

1231
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,319
those of you who want to get

1232
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,960
you know really advanced i can work you

1233
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,520
through

1234
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,240
making a firefly where actually the

1235
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,839
entire oscillator

1236
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,720
is in the firefly but that's not what

1237
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,760
i'm going to teach you through this

1238
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,880
tutorial

1239
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:57,599
so next slide

1240
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,000
all right so first of all find yourself

1241
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,119
one led

1242
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,359
that looks firefly like and i think it's

1243
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,040
helpful to refer back to those pictures

1244
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,280
or google firefly just to get a sense of

1245
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,760
color

1246
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,599
you know like browns and yellows and

1247
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,520
oranges work really well

1248
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,680
and then you want to find an led i think

1249
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,359
yellow is great but it could be any

1250
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,160
color

1251
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,720
and if possible you know just think

1252
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,319
about the proportions of the

1253
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,119
led and the resistor because the more

1254
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:24,720
you have the proportions accurate the

1255
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,760
more it's going to look

1256
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,240
realistic next slide

1257
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,240
just fyi it's very helpful to have a box

1258
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:36,880
somewhere

1259
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,200
full of a bunch of random electronic

1260
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,079
components that can be really useful for

1261
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,200
uh circuit sculpture because um if for

1262
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,079
example like

1263
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,400
so getting back to the led resistor

1264
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,520
combo

1265
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,960
um so i use 12 volts maybe you're using

1266
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,119
five or three volts it really doesn't

1267
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,119
matter you adjust your resistor value

1268
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,240
accordingly

1269
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,640
uh but just to give you kind of a hand

1270
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,720
waving range you want your

1271
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,000
resistor value to be somewhere between

1272
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,760
let's say a hundred ohms and 10k

1273
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,640
i mean it don't stress about it if you

1274
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,119
happen to have resistors that are like

1275
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,640
all really huge then um put them

1276
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,160
in parallel to reduce their resistance

1277
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,680
if you happen to have resistors that are

1278
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,280
all like

1279
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,160
one ohm that would be pretty small but

1280
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,000
link them together in series and

1281
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,839
and get what you need so move along

1282
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,119
um you don't need to have this but i'm

1283
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,880
going to show you how to use it

1284
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,200
you could also use double-sided tape or

1285
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,160
you could use

1286
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,319
a bench vise what or you know whatever

1287
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,160
it is that you have on hand

1288
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,599
um but modeling play so

1289
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,000
like that you can just get at any art

1290
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,200
supply store

1291
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,319
um water-based it makes a great

1292
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,839
quick and dirty jig

1293
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
so make sure you know which side of your

1294
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,040
led is the anode and which side is the

1295
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,599
cathode

1296
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,319
again google it if you're concerned the

1297
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,839
reason why this is important

1298
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:24,079
is that um the negative or

1299
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,559
the battery needs to be plugged into

1300
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:27,599
ground

1301
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,559
and the anode or positive side of the

1302
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,000
battery is going to be connected to

1303
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,960
power

1304
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,040
one or the other side is going to be

1305
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,559
connected to the resistor

1306
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,640
doesn't matter which side but you need

1307
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,079
to make sure that you respect the

1308
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,520
polarity of the led

1309
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,720
to move on

1310
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,720
so here's how i use clay is a jig just

1311
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,880
like put a blob on a

1312
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,880
on your bench and stick your resistor

1313
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,400
into it next slide

1314
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,079
and then you can use another blob and

1315
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,200
stick your uh

1316
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,160
led into it and what i love about it is

1317
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,920
one of the hard things with jigs is

1318
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,760
um sometimes you'll get your jig set up

1319
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,760
but then your components are just not

1320
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,920
quite lined up and it's really fiddly

1321
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,040
and irritating

1322
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,119
but with clay you can just smush it and

1323
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,040
then once you take your components out

1324
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,680
next slide

1325
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,880
if there's any residue of clay you can

1326
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,559
just wipe it off with your finger

1327
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,480
or use like a slightly damp piece of

1328
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,559
paper towel anyway so

1329
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,359
at this point uh what you've got now is

1330
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:32,240
a resistor

1331
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,400
connected with a very short lead to one

1332
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,240
side of your led because you can see how

1333
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,400
we're making like the body and the tail

1334
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,680
of the firefly next slide

1335
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,319
all right so now take yourself a piece

1336
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:44,960
of

1337
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,599
long wire always longer is always better

1338
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,599
because you can always cut it later

1339
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,240
i used black uh brown it doesn't really

1340
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,680
matter the color but i think black's

1341
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,000
nice

1342
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,760
because of the color of the firefly

1343
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,119
wings and make

1344
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,440
two figure eights with your wire and

1345
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,880
make sure you've got uh

1346
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,440
some length on the end so next slide

1347
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,319
all right and now you want to find the

1348
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,359
middle point

1349
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,720
of that figure eight and uh taking one

1350
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,119
of them

1351
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,839
next slide

1352
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,559
you're gonna strip that whole length and

1353
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,480
remember keep keep some extra wire on

1354
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,920
that end

1355
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,480
next slide

1356
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,440
so just to show you kind of where you

1357
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,640
are right now right you've got two

1358
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,400
figure eights one of them is stripped

1359
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,319
to that middle point next slide

1360
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,640
all right so wrap it around to make

1361
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,079
yourself one

1362
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:50,559
set of wings at the bottom next slide

1363
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,760
and then remove your insulation just a

1364
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,400
little bit

1365
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,400
in the middle of the wire that still has

1366
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,240
the insulation on it

1367
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,920
next slide that way you can wrap the

1368
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,760
whole thing so now you basically have

1369
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,760
created like the top of

1370
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,200
the wings on a firefly uh where they're

1371
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,599
black and then you've got your your more

1372
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,480
like lightweight

1373
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,960
papery wings of the actual firefly and i

1374
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,800
just want to point out this is also like

1375
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,000
if you wanted to do

1376
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,040
this but then add extra detail into your

1377
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,040
wings you could totally do that because

1378
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,480
now you've got the

1379
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,640
the wire form on the outside like what

1380
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,079
yuri just showed you

1381
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,400
and you could tape it down you know and

1382
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,559
bend the wire of the black at the top

1383
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,240
and give yourself some detail inside of

1384
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,359
those wings next slide

1385
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,359
so solder in the middle so it's secure

1386
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,520
now take your resistor led pair

1387
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,640
and wrap your extra wire around it to

1388
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,000
attach your wings in the front

1389
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,680
and then if you take that extra wire

1390
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,599
that you have left over from your wing

1391
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:58,319
loop

1392
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,800
and loop it back around and solder it to

1393
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,000
the resistor lead

1394
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,359
next slide you can then

1395
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,200
cut that loop and you've just given

1396
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,520
yourself your front legs

1397
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,800
to move next slide

1398
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,240
and then with the leftover uh led lead

1399
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,480
if you use a pair of needle nose pliers

1400
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,559
you can coil it up to make like eyes or

1401
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:21,920
face however you want to do that you

1402
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,440
could you know for another instinct

1403
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,280
you could make another loop and cut that

1404
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,960
so it has antenna

1405
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,839
next slide

1406
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,520
okay so now we're going to move on to um

1407
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,920
so the yellow wire i'm using here i

1408
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,680
should have said this before the black

1409
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,319
wire

1410
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,160
in the wings and the part that we

1411
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,160
stripped that is going to go to ground

1412
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:44,720
so

1413
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,200
i always ever use black or brown or a

1414
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,720
dark color to integrate

1415
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,480
indicate my ground lead so i don't get

1416
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,119
confused and so here i've picked yellow

1417
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,720
for my second wire that we're going to

1418
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,640
take to power

1419
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,240
it could be orange i mean it could be

1420
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,079
red it could be whatever i think yellow

1421
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:00,559
looks

1422
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,280
like a firefly trail though so strip

1423
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,920
part of that

1424
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,480
and now take that lead and give yourself

1425
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,520
plenty of extra and

1426
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,720
lay it right up at the top of the

1427
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,040
of the other side of the led don't touch

1428
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,119
the side that's connected to ground

1429
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,839
next slide

1430
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,720
okay so you've soldered it right up

1431
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,920
there at the top your

1432
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,079
your two leads are not touching and now

1433
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,680
you want to bend that

1434
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,799
so then next slide um you're gonna cut

1435
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:42,400
that lead to make a leg next slide

1436
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,400
okay and so

1437
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,559
this is kind of a nice to have but what

1438
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,640
i did here was because that black

1439
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,880
wire that was coming off is just you

1440
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,760
know the black is sort of visually heavy

1441
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,680
i'm going to strip the insulation off

1442
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,319
next slide

1443
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,440
and same thing on my on my power side i

1444
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,960
didn't strip off the yellow because i

1445
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,799
thought it'd be really cool to just

1446
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,359
gently break the insulation and scooch

1447
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,000
it apart

1448
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,319
to make you know like it almost looks

1449
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,480
like a blinking trail

1450
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,680
next slide

1451
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,200
and so at this point this you know you

1452
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,520
you've got your firefly you've got your

1453
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,400
ground lead

1454
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,160
you've got your power lead so if you

1455
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,160
plug this in it will light up but it

1456
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:32,839
will not

1457
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:36,160
blink so as i mentioned if you want to

1458
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,680
if you have a breadboard and you feel

1459
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,520
comfortable breadboarding

1460
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,520
uh some form of oscillator this is an a

1461
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,440
stable multivibrator

1462
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,440
mohit's going to show you how to build a

1463
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,079
a an oscillator using a 555

1464
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,000
timer and there's numerous ways to do

1465
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,400
this but um anyway this is one

1466
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,960
next slide

1467
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,160
um and there you go so like i showed you

1468
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:00,720
before

1469
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,000
here's my first here's the firefly i

1470
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,040
just described

1471
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,880
and it's plugged into my my breadboarded

1472
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,799
oscillator here so i think for those of

1473
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:11,680
you that

1474
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,160
want to get your feet wet making

1475
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:14,720
something

1476
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,280
analog electronic this is a good time to

1477
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,200
do it i'm happy to help talk you through

1478
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,279
it

1479
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,920
oh there's one more slide but i've

1480
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,960
already mentioned this

1481
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,119
actually a couple more so if you wanted

1482
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,040
to add detail to your wings and again

1483
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,000
you can use your

1484
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,280
your jigs for that um so you can see

1485
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,440
there where i've added some more detail

1486
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,400
to the wings

1487
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,119
and laying out my components because you

1488
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,960
know if you want to get really advanced

1489
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,960
and put your a stable multivibrator

1490
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,079
actually in the body

1491
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,520
of the firefly next slide

1492
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:51,119
um so yeah i if you look at my instagram

1493
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,280
i've got video of this guy

1494
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,799
actually i've got him right here i can

1495
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,559
just plug it in for you

1496
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,720
and then we're going to move on so while

1497
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,760
he can

1498
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,119
talk to you about uh how to

1499
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,960
build something with the 555 timer but

1500
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,000
um anyway i'll show you that later

1501
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,760
because i don't want to hold this up but

1502
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,319
um

1503
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,799
yeah i look forward to helping you guys

1504
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,960
out

1505
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,280
thank you so much kelly um that is such

1506
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,799
a wonderful way to

1507
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:25,280
just use a simple piece of wire and just

1508
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,079
you know

1509
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,599
bend it uh in a very organic

1510
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,319
and uh

1511
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,920
beautiful shape i've always struggled

1512
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,400
with organic shapes you know curves um

1513
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,839
just being a you know engineer who

1514
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,520
designs circuit boards i

1515
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,440
see everything in straight lines in 45

1516
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,559
degrees

1517
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,559
but i think kelly has pushed me to try

1518
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:47,680
and see like you know

1519
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,760
working with organic shapes is not that

1520
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,200
difficult um

1521
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,440
so i challenge myself uh based on what

1522
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,640
kelly

1523
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,599
uh showed how do you use electronic

1524
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,520
components so that they become

1525
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,000
the body of the sculpture in a way where

1526
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,640
it's like

1527
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,920
almost anatomically correct so i went

1528
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,799
ahead and

1529
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,760
designed my version of a firefly that

1530
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,920
uses a simple

1531
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,599
triple five astable in an astable mode

1532
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,480
where it blinks an led

1533
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,640
over here you see the resistors that are

1534
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,400
on the wings are basically resistors in

1535
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,440
parallel

1536
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,319
so they compute out to one single

1537
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:26,960
resistance

1538
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,760
um both the schematic and the template

1539
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,640
are on the

1540
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,599
hackadays remoticon circuit culture uh

1541
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,680
webpage so you can easily download these

1542
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,520
i won't go into the details of actually

1543
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,599
making this because i think we have had

1544
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,000
enough good groundwork uh for us to

1545
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,559
understand how one would go about

1546
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,200
building one of these now i initially

1547
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,680
started by building a

1548
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,160
smaller quick prototype on the right and

1549
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,280
then made a little bit

1550
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,359
elaborate uh version of it the two

1551
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,880
capacitors on the front that you see are

1552
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,400
just basic optional

1553
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,200
bypass capacitors that also act like

1554
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,880
eyes

1555
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,040
the capacitor adds timing and then the

1556
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,400
led at the back

1557
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,599
so please feel free to take an own uh

1558
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,200
take at this like own version and you

1559
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,640
know improvise as the

1560
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,319
time allows you don't have to finish the

1561
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,880
sculpture sculpture today

1562
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,559
but this basically gives you an idea as

1563
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,480
to what the process looks like

1564
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,880
uh here's the underbelly uh of these two

1565
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,280
sculptures you know using i'm using

1566
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,160
0.4 millimeter brass wire but you don't

1567
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,680
have to use brows you can use anything

1568
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,599
that is available at hand

1569
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,040
and here is the sculpture in action

1570
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,160
uh i used eagle uh autodesk eagle

1571
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,720
uh schematic capture to design the

1572
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,240
schematic as well as

1573
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,040
layout the template so you know you can

1574
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,640
easily uh

1575
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,799
take a print out and use that as a

1576
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,559
template as

1577
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,040
yuri had previously taught us um just

1578
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,400
using that as a reference but please

1579
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,640
feel free to improvise um

1580
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,160
and you know start building a sculpture

1581
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,880
so at this point we will uh stop

1582
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:03,760
presenting

1583
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,040
and uh open the floor for folks to you

1584
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,799
know collaborate at tables this is more

1585
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:09,440
of a

1586
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,119
an experiment where we will go around

1587
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,799
the tables talk to folks see if they

1588
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:13,760
have any questions

1589
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,319
concerns um and you know have more

1590
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,160
one-on-one time

1591
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,400
so with that uh i look forward to

1592
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,520
chatting you

1593
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,040
virtually uh on this uh

1594
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,559
remo platform thank you everyone

1595
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:36,319
see you at the tables
