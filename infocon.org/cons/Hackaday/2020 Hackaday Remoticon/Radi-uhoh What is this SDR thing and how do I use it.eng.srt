please interact

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,400
and uh help each other out with uh any

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,000
needs or concerns

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,239
or questions that people might have uh

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,120
but today

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,200
josh conway will be hosting uh

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,079
discussion radio

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,800
and um josh is a hacker a hacker

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,879
a systems administrator a 3d printer

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,320

developer an amateur radio operator

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,559
and a musician he finds interest in

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,760
creating new things

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,480
and reusing tech in different ways and

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,680
abusing

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,160
unintended methodologies hidden inside

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,800
hardware

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,080
and software uh and with that josh

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,400
thank you for being with us and uh

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,360
please uh

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,640
let's uh hear from you hey thank you

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,280
very much

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,000
this is josh conway uh let me get the

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:27,280
presentation started here this is radio

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,680
what is this sdr thing and how do i use

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,400
it now

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,079
you've seen a lot of articles on hack a

38
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,320
day about software-defined radio

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,720
and we keep i keep seeing these

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,240
wonderful articles about doing this

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,840
really cool thing or that really cool

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,640
thing

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,520
but i've always seen that there is not

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,560
really a

45
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,880
gentler way of opening people up to what

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,079
this is what sdr

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,000
is this is how to incorporate it into

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,680
your own projects

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,600
and do really cool things that maybe

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
nobody else has ever thought of before

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,799
so that's kind of where i'm going with

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,799
this whole discussion here

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,640
who i am i've actually been known for

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,240
quite a few things uh

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,880
all of them on hackaday uh way back in

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,439
the day in

57
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,439
2015 i actually set up facial

58
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,679
recognition for your convention

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,720
uh that was a cbd cpu bound no gpu no

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,599
internet

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,959
uh system i also did a multi-site

62
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,840
home hackerspace office automation i

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,440
didn't trust any of the iot stuff out

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,080
there

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,879
because i the sn iot stands for security

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,080
aka none

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,879
i wanted to build my own so it actually

68
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,480
has security in it

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,239
and then i also did some really cool

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,599
stuff in 2014 about the

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,440
thalamic labs and opening up and open

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,200
sourcing this really cool my electrical

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,000
bracelet

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680
that eventually i know some people use

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,840
for

76
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,680
prosthesis controls so i enjoy a lot of

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,879
different various

78
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,080
things so about this class this is the

79
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,000
basics of software-defined radio

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,280
we're going to talk about the essential

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,720
hardware we're about the essential

82
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
software and optional software for

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
building throughout your own projects

84
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,080
investigating what kind of hardware you

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,200
own and and i mean by that is

86
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,280
for example what things are around your

87
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
area that use radio controls

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,879
that you would like to be able to

89
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
automate talk to get information off of

90
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,000
and the goal there is things that you

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,480
own and then how you can use the

92
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
proprietary stuff more effectively they

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,080
may have not opened it up somebody

94
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,400
may already have so i'd like to get in

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,120
there

96
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,040
what can we do and how do we use that

97
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,400
information that we already have

98
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,879
what we're not talking about though this

99
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,879
is a critical one is we are not talking

100
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,280
about

101
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,840
observing others video audio or text

102
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,959
transmissions

103
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,040
that includes cell pagers satellite

104
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
we're not doing that

105
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,920
we're not breaking stuff or doing

106
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,760
unintended effects to hardware you don't

107
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,720
have permission to

108
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
that's a this is a critical thing we

109
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,920
don't you know there's there's a lot of

110
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,040
things we can do

111
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,920
bad with uh software-defined radio

112
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,280
transmissions

113
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,959
we don't want to do them because it's

114
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
just not right and i don't want to

115
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,400
discuss exploits in general here

116
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,640
now do note i do also attend defcon and

117
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,439
i have no problem

118
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,959
discussing theoretical attacks there but

119
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,519
theoretical is as far as i'll go and the

120
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,959
lastly here is violating fcc rules

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,400
that's a great way to have some very

122
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,680
friendly people on your doorstep

123
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,519
confiscating everything electronic in

124
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,639
your house

125
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,199
uh i know one person it happened to and

126
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,798
you do not want to be at the receiving

127
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,758
end of that summons

128
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,040
so what is this software defined radio

129
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,639
thing

130
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,280
well it is software defined radio and

131
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,320
what we're doing

132
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,880
is software development radio trades a

133
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,400
multitude of

134
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,560
monolithic radio hardware for a

135
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,000
complicated software problem

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,520
now it sounds like we're trading not

137
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,199
very good thing let me explain what's

138
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,759
going on here and why

139
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,240
so here's two simple circuits here's a

140
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,199
simple fm

141
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,320
receiver uh over on the left side and

142
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,120
there's a simple

143
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,600
am receiver on the right side as you can

144
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,240
see they

145
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
look pretty different i mean they have

146
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
an antenna that's common they have an

147
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,280
earphones that are common but everything

148
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,639
else in there is

149
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,560
not really common and the thing is is

150
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,840
when we start looking at this

151
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,000
if you want to use a different protocol

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
a different way of decoding data it

153
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,720
requires different hardware each time

154
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,919
and unfortunately that

155
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,919
has a significant cost if you want to

156
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,520
have more than you know a few protocols

157
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,719
that you want to be able to access

158
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,800
and really there's actually tens of

159
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,960
thousands of different protocols

160
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,479
and in history through radio

161
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,800
uh if you wanted a new protocol you had

162
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,759
to build

163
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,199
transmitting hardware you had to build

164
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,880
receiving hardware

165
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,240
and that was just for that single

166
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,960
protocol there was no real way to update

167
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,520
unless you got a soldering iron and went

168
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,479
to town

169
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,680
uh but what we're doing here is software

170
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
defined radio allows us to switch the

171
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,400
core

172
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,919
of that rate what makes the radio a

173
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,080
radio and say hey instead of having

174
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,280
different hardware

175
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
we can have literally one piece of

176
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
hardware that does a lot of things

177
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,600
and we can swap out software to give it

178
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,520
the protocol that we want

179
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,240
and of course the monolithic hardware

180
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
requires the new hardware to gain those

181
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,840
new functions or to update

182
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,560
uh sdr software allows you to have

183
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,360
real-time

184
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,680
over-the-air updates of the protocol as

185
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,720
we speak

186
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,240
so there are some really cool things

187
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
that software-defined radio allows

188
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,039
what isn't it good for because a lot of

189
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,080
times this doesn't

190
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,000
is discussed very well the biggest thing

191
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
it's not good for is your wallet

192
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,440
this costs so much

193
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
if we talk about some of the lower end

194
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,840
uh receiver only hardware

195
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,560
it's 15 20 dollars it's cheap it's it's

196
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,520
reasonable

197
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
the moment you start waiting to say

198
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
capture a why

199
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,039
a 802.11 uh wi-fi

200
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,800
with pattern and look at that you look

201
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
at your signature from your laptop

202
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,720
you're spending a lot more in the range

203
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,639
of a few hundred dollars

204
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,319
and that's just to even get in to be

205
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,639
able to do that work

206
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,479
so and then of course if you want to do

207
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,240
make your own antennas it starts getting

208
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
up into the thousands of dollars range

209
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,520
it gets crazy be prepared for it

210
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,800
the next thing it's not good for is

211
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,680
protocols with hard timing constraints

212
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
so there are protocols out there digital

213
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,520
protocols specifically

214
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,840
that have very hard timing that says

215
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
that your packet has to be at this exact

216
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,160
time or that exact time

217
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,800
and sdr is because they have to go from

218
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
the radial hardware to the cpu

219
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,039
back to the radio hardware you have a

220
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,560
certain amount of lag

221
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,319
that you can't really get around

222
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,680
there are some ways around that with

223
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,120
some of the really expensive software

224
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,440
defined radios

225
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,199
but that also requires knowing how to do

226
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,879
hardware programming as well

227
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,759
so it's not for the faint of heart uh

228
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,120
another thing it's not good for is

229
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,479
nearby loud fm broadcast stations

230
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,120
so i've got a uh a local radio station

231
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,800
here that transmits i think

232
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,479
last i checked it was like 100 kilowatts

233
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,479
of power it's like a mile mile and a

234
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,440
half away

235
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,759
so i see that at its frequency and then

236
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,360
i see that at double its frequency and

237
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,960
triple its frequency and quadruple its

238
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
frequency and i see it ghosting across

239
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,960
the whole spectrum

240
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,639
so that's kind of a pain to get around

241
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,240
we have things that we can put that we

242
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,680
have filters that we can put to filter

243
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,879
that out

244
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,879
but just note that loud local stations

245
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,720
can cause problems for your

246
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,400
software-defined radio

247
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
and the last one it's also unfortunately

248
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,240
it's actually pretty easy to break the

249
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,159
law with a software-defined radio

250
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,679
transmitter

251
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,559
um there's things that you may not

252
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,919
realize if you're not

253
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,159
fully versus the law it can get you into

254
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,479
trouble accidentally

255
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,240
so that's also something to keep in mind

256
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,640
with this

257
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,959
the basics behind software the radio

258
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,360
signals we go into here

259
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,399
and everybody everybody's thinking has a

260
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,720
modulation it's a way that it encodes or

261
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,680
decodes

262
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,440
and think of like a zip file of where

263
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
you have a file and you run a zip

264
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,120
compress on it and turns into a zip file

265
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,720
that's a direction to zip

266
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,320
and then you can also go the reverse way

267
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
where you go from zip

268
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,519
and then you run an unzip and it creates

269
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,279
the original file that's kind of what a

270
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,399
modulation is

271
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,040
and we have different modulation types

272
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,839
so analog modulation as we see here

273
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,720
we're familiar with am you know am radio

274
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,360
fm

275
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,000
frequency modulation radio now the one

276
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,519
we don't really hear much of is actually

277
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,800
called phase modulation

278
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,040
that's hard to implement in hardware

279
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,640
it's easy to do in software-defined

280
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,839
radio

281
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,320
uh for digital side of things we start

282
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
seeing things like amplitude shift

283
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,480
keying

284
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
frequency shift keying and phase shift

285
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,399
keying

286
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,160
so here's what these things look like so

287
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,200
what we're going to see a lot of at

288
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,360
least what we do is digital works

289
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,519
where we have data coming in either as

290
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,959
ones or zeros

291
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,200
as we see we vary back and forth we have

292
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,040
to apply a carrier wave which is

293
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
essentially this is the frequency we're

294
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,880
doing things on

295
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,160
um and then from there ask

296
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
if you look down the right side there it

297
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,279
says ask signal

298
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,920
amplitude shift keying you can see where

299
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,519
the ones and the zeros line

300
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,640
up and this is how that data is encoded

301
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
uh the frequency shift keying instead of

302
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,839
adjusting the

303
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,839
height of the wave it adjusts the

304
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,760
compression of the wave

305
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,839
uh phase shift keying is the weird one

306
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,600
and that's where it actually

307
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,839
it goes one direction and then it flips

308
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,839
to the other direction

309
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,200
so that's kind of what these signals

310
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,279
look like

311
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,200
we get into here and this is the analog

312
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,320
side of things now

313
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,920
so we have an analog signal instead of

314
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,240
having ones and zeros we have a analog

315
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
curve and then we add the carrier

316
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,200
because we have to be on a frequency

317
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,279
and then now that's what am looks like

318
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,959
it's a nice happy waved

319
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,079
curve like that uh fm

320
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,240
has the similar compression that we saw

321
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,720
before

322
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,640
and then pm now this is the weird thing

323
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,800
about pm phase modulation

324
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,200
radio signals it's really really hard to

325
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,560
tell the difference between an

326
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,480
fm and a pm uh analog signal

327
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,240
as you see it's just shifted a little

328
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
bit so this is actually

329
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,680
that's one of the reasons why we don't

330
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,120
really see too much of that and we

331
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,959
haven't seen it

332
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,480
although we are starting to see more and

333
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,399
more phase modulation in the digital

334
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,720
realm

335
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,200
and then it gets crazy so this is

336
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,399
quadrature amplitude modulation so

337
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,240
anyone has ever heard of i think the

338
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,640
term is hd radio

339
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,360
and the high definition radio carriers

340
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,959
that show up alongside

341
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,839
fm stations actually encode data similar

342
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:42,079
to

343
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,959
this and

344
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,639
what ends up happening is it encodes a

345
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,839
phase and amplitude to determine which

346
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,800
region it hits in the signal oops

347
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,360
and this and let me go back here a

348
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,079
little bit

349
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,720
so what ends up happening is the data

350
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,200
ends up

351
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,760
being in one of four quadrants and that

352
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,560
means that

353
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,320
each sample is one out of four of four

354
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,440
bits per

355
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,480
sample uh so the data it gets ends up

356
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,160
looking very compressed

357
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,519
uh if you look at it in a in some of the

358
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279
software defined radio tools to look at

359
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,680
signals you'll see it as a very strong

360
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,519
equally strong bar of signal that looks

361
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,959
like static

362
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,320
and that's actually what these kind of

363
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,399
signals look like and they're called

364
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,399
quadrature amplitude modulation and of

365
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,440
course you know the

366
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,839
better the radios we get we can actually

367
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,680
go up and create lots more

368
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,959
uh lots more points uh

369
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,639
of how to do the data here i don't know

370
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,399
why my chart by chart is actually just

371
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,839
not working and it would show what this

372
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,120
looks like

373
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,760
so each and in this case on the left

374
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,560
side here

375
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,079
you have 16 points here each of these

376
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,959
represents a

377
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,480
16 bits and then by the

378
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,440
amplitude in the phase tells which

379
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,560
coordinate to go to

380
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,120
which bit what that represents we call

381
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880
this each thing here we call that a

382
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,959
symbol

383
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,079
so the symbols represent this data so

384
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,760
the data can be compressed fairly well

385
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,040
so let's get to the actual hardware to

386
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,399
determine what we have

387
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,200
and what we can use

388
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,560
so everyone has heard of the notorious

389
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,279
rtl

390
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,800
sdr uh this is ubiquitous this is really

391
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,720
what started a lot of

392
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,560
the hacker community getting into

393
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,160
software-defined radio

394
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,079
and it's really pretty amazing for its

395
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,360
time uh

396
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,839
and this thing will set you back fifteen

397
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,360
twenty dollars

398
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,320
it's inexpensive it's easy to obtain

399
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,079
from a lot of different sources

400
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,720
uh the frequency response uh is two

401
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,160
point four twenty four megahertz to

402
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,880
seventeen sixty six megahertz

403
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,120
and that means that it's able to tune

404
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,199
into any of those bands between

405
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,240
between those two frequencies now we in

406
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,680
software define radio we also talk about

407
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,880
how big the bandwidth

408
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,199
is so you can only look at a window of

409
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,440
that spectrum at any one time

410
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,399
and that window we call the bandwidth

411
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,720
and in this in our tlsdr case i believe

412
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,199
it's 2.4 megahertz bandwidth

413
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,040
so you could have a sliding window that

414
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,800
you can look at that section back and

415
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,519
forth

416
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,920
now there are some other various rtl

417
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,720
varia

418
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,040
varieties that can go i believe up to

419
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,440
three megahertz bandwidth

420
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
and some have different features and

421
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,480
such but there's a there's a lot of

422
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
variation there

423
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,839
the bad unfortunately it is also cheap

424
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,519
yeah if you want to capture anything

425
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,680
larger than the 2.4 megahertz of

426
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,639
bandwidth

427
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,279
uh you need to get something better

428
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,560
sometimes

429
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,000
the the quality from less reputable

430
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,800
dealers uh the quality isn't there you

431
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,320
end up with repackages

432
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,600
the signals aren't very good and usually

433
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,399
the antennas they

434
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,360
include are not the best of antennas out

435
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,399
there

436
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,839
that's going to get you up and running

437
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,480
barely but anything past that if you go

438
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,160
to more specialized stuff

439
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,680
uh it doesn't really work

440
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,839
we have the next one here uh analog

441
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,959
devices makes

442
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,120
this device it's called the avon pluto

443
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,680
and that stands for analog devices

444
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,839
adaptive learning module and the name

445
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,040
pluto and

446
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,839
this device i actually have right here

447
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,959
and as you see it's a micro usb at the

448
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:43,920
bottom there

449
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,120
and you have a transmit side and you

450
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,160
have a receive side

451
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,079
and of course there's two antennas there

452
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,240
um this will set you back

453
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,720
i think right now it's around 150. it it

454
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,399
varies back and forth

455
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,440
uh it is extremely hackable uh so what

456
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
this action device is is actually a

457
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,839
linux arm9 computer built into here

458
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,839
uh and you can log into that with the

459
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,040
root credentials and

460
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,959
and it's your own device and you can

461
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,880
make all sorts of changes out there

462
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,839
um the bandwidth for this device there's

463
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,160
a

464
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,880
uh software modification that allows

465
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,199
from 90 megahertz to six gigahertz

466
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,040
which is amazing for this kind of a

467
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,480
platform

468
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,639
the bandwidth is 20 megahertz and you

469
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,160
can also potentially go up to 56

470
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,199
megahertz

471
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,440
but they they get rid of a part of the

472
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,399
data so you drop

473
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,600
a part of the data you can also run

474
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,519
linux programs on this device so you can

475
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,839
write linux arm9 programs

476
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,680
push it to the firmware and you can run

477
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,600
things directly from this

478
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,320
uh the bad it can be hard to obtain uh

479
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,040
when people

480
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,800
hear about it they tend to sell out very

481
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,320
very quickly

482
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,639
the transmit is pretty low we're about

483
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,639
five milliwatts of transmit which is

484
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,920
very low it'll barely get you in trouble

485
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,519
now the antennas are well the antennas

486
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,160
are

487
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,079
not great as you can see there that's

488
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,919
the stock antennas and of course we have

489
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,000
plenty other ones we can put on there

490
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,839
and the biggest downside for this device

491
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,280
is it's a usb 2 so you're

492
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,000
limited by the usb 2 bandwidth which

493
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,599
this device potentially could deliver a

494
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,559
lot better

495
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,039
but just the usb 2 subsystem just can't

496
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,919
perform that

497
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,319
as well

498
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,919
we have the ubiquitous hack rf this

499
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:28,319
thing is

500
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,320
just amazing workhorse so the official

501
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,880
hack rf will set you back around 300

502
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,200
it's just tremendously well supported

503
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,039
there's just no question about that

504
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,679
it is superb it covers from one

505
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,440
megahertz to six gigahertz

506
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,400
so this gets into the high frequency and

507
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,280
that area

508
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,120
of the amateur radio spectrum as well

509
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,880
it's 8-bit signal capture so it

510
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,280
doesn't do as well at the very very low

511
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,559
end

512
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,000
but you can still get down there and

513
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
play around it has a sweep mode which

514
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,520
i've not found any other

515
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,280
software-defined radio have and what

516
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,559
that sweep mode is is

517
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,160
it allows you to sweep through the whole

518
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,760
spectrum from one megahertz to six

519
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,880
gigahertz

520
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,679
at a speed of eight gigahertz a second

521
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,240
so if you're

522
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,320
if you're tracking and doing like radio

523
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,600
direction finding or you're trying to

524
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,960
figure out what device

525
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,000
what frequency is this device talking on

526
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,520
the sweep mode is extremely

527
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,600
useful very quickly narrow devices down

528
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,559
find what things are talking and narrow

529
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,080
your work to figure out okay

530
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,240
how do i go further with doing radio

531
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,679
detection

532
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,320
uh the bad unfortunately is simplex

533
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,720
which

534
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,360
simplex means it can either transmit or

535
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,799
it can receive

536
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,080
but it can't do that at the same time

537
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,840
and i mentioned in there in the bed as

538
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,160
well as 8-bit iq

539
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,480
the iq is that data that we're capturing

540
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,600
from the

541
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,600
radio and the 8-bit limits the quality

542
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,960
of the details of the data we're getting

543
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,919
with the radio data coming in the higher

544
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,840
the bits the better

545
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,520
this device came out a few years ago so

546
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,280
8-bit was perfectly fine then

547
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
now we're starting to see things upwards

548
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,480
of 16 bits

549
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,400
capture for iq but still this hack rf

550
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,880
is an amazing amazing piece of hardware

551
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,400
this is a fairly new imprint that

552
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,520
entered i believe

553
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,280
last year it's called the kiberos sdr

554
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,919
and have one right here what this is

555
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,760
this is a really really neat device

556
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,559
is this is actually for rtl sdrs

557
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,799
combined together as one board

558
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,440
now okay so it only goes from 24

559
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,280
megahertz to 1.7 gigahertz

560
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,919
times four but what this means is you

561
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,640
can do

562
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,200
triangulation you can do trilateration

563
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,840
effectively those two words are

564
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,080
words that stand for being able to track

565
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,240
real time where signals are coming from

566
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,880
and where they are at in reference to

567
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,240
where you are

568
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,840
so let's say you wanted to watch where

569
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,400
an airplane is you would be able to

570
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
track that real time by triangulating

571
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,400
where the signals are coming from

572
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,280
and going oh it's over this direction up

573
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,679
a mile and a half

574
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,039
there really isn't much else out there

575
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,080
that can do something like this

576
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,919
especially at 150 dollar price point

577
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,480
it's just an amazing tool now the

578
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,559
there's a little bit of a downside here

579
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,039
and the

580
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,520
the tool chain is fairly raw still so

581
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
you have to do a lot of

582
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,559
um you do radio work and similar which

583
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,960
gnu radio can be fairly difficult

584
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,080
but this allows you to do a lot of

585
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,240
triangulation and trilateration that you

586
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,760
wouldn't normally be able to do with one

587
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,720
device

588
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,159
it's also eight bit because it's

589
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,039
literally just four rtl sdrs

590
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,559
uh on a custom board

591
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,039
we have a blade rf this is starting to

592
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:55,840
get into

593
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,640
money but this is an amazing board so

594
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,240
what this is this is this costs about

595
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,600
480 dollars and as you see there there's

596
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,200
actually four

597
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,919
uh jacks at the end there and two of

598
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,760
them are transmits and two of them are

599
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,640
receives

600
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,039
so we can actually do quite a lot of

601
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,360
things at the same time with this device

602
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,960
um its bandwidth is from 47 megahertz to

603
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,640
six gigahertz

604
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,120
at 61 megahertz bandwidth but that's a

605
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,960
huge swath of spectrum that you're

606
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,720
looking at

607
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
so you can do tons of things in terms of

608
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,799
investigations what's going on

609
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,080
especially if you start getting into the

610
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,919
more complicated digital modes

611
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,360
this thing is really going to perform

612
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,200
well bad

613
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,799
well it's almost 500 it's not

614
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,919
cheap but it's well worth it uh it does

615
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,919
have some clock jitter which we have to

616
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,440
worry about timing a little bit

617
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,880
on uh on what frequency is really what

618
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,840
frequency

619
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,200
because heat and cold can affect a

620
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
software-defined radio

621
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,960
so we have to pay attention to that and

622
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,320
then some of the

623
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,640
fellow advanced radio hackers that i

624
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,679
know

625
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,720
recommend something called the gpsdo now

626
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,000
what that means is it

627
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,720
is obviously everyone knows where gps is

628
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,120
but

629
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,679
a do is a disciplined oscillator which

630
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,320
is a

631
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,799
fancy word for saying hooking a gps up

632
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,240
to this thing and then using

633
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,960
gps time to synchronize this thing

634
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,480
perfectly

635
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
so it does add a little bit of extra

636
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,320
cost but there are some really cool

637
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,840
things that you get from that

638
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,280
especially if you're doing like uh

639
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,600
talking to amateur radio satellites or

640
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,559
similar

641
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,320
that's where a disciplined oscillator

642
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,320
really really shines

643
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,120
we also have antenna discussions uh

644
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,159
because well

645
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,919
as you see here some of the default

646
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,520
antennas are not

647
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,280
not great so

648
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,600
omnidirectional antennas uh we've all

649
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
seen these there's the stick antennas

650
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,919
we've seen them uh you put up the rabbit

651
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,280
ears on your house

652
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,600
for the uh and this is the kind of

653
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,039
antenna that we have here

654
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,159
now uh

655
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,760
this is nothing fancy i mean we've all

656
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,039
seen this if we if we play around with

657
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,080
regular wi-fi

658
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,480
uh antennas you'll see that and the

659
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,080
omnidirectional this is a weird way of

660
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,520
looking at this so this whole

661
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
polarization thing that you see on the

662
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,720
uh right side

663
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,400
the center and the right the

664
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
polarization is

665
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,520
where does this antenna actually see

666
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,919
so if you look here horizontal so think

667
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,600
about you're on the ground plane there

668
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,120
and you have this antenna up this is

669
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,960
roughly equal signal across lateral

670
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,240
where you're looking at now vertical

671
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,200
what this is this tells you that the

672
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,320
vertical pattern so

673
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,159
even though it's horizontal it's got a

674
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,480
vertical lobes that come out

675
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,080
like kind of like uh star pedals

676
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,159
and that means that if you're let's say

677
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,240
you're on a second or third story

678
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,360
you're not going to have very good

679
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,279
transmission because it's not terribly

680
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,159
strong there

681
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,080
but if you as long as you're on the same

682
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,279
equal plane

683
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,640
now you have some pretty good signal

684
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,240
with this with this omnidirectional

685
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,360
antenna

686
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,559
uh so these charts help you understand

687
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,960
what antenna what it looks like in terms

688
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,640
of its radiation pattern

689
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,760
and what it can see

690
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,400
yagi's these are fairly common

691
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,279
especially if

692
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,840
in the more rural areas uh you're gonna

693
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,200
see a lot of these types of antennas of

694
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,400
where you have the

695
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,919
uh cross hatch uh three times or four

696
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,880
times or five

697
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,000
times in a directional arrow-ish

698
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,480
pattern and these antennas are really

699
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,520
great especially and

700
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,000
i know uh that a lot of times you'll see

701
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,960
these uh

702
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,640
for getting tv reception um

703
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,559
and they'll be directed at the the major

704
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,320
city that you're living near to be able

705
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,559
to

706
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,440
watch tv uh over-the-air broadcast from

707
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,240
them

708
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,120
and the reason being is these antennas

709
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,799
have extremely

710
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,880
directional patterns so if we look on

711
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,840
the horizontal which

712
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,760
now they're they are flip here so look

713
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,200
at the far right side

714
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,799
and you'll see the horizontal is this

715
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,960
very long big lobe

716
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,640
with a lot of little spiky lobes on the

717
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,960
side but it's very very directional

718
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
now signals behind it you're you're

719
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,640
probably not going to get anything

720
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,360
um only in that direction and of course

721
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
the same thing with vertical

722
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,440
now if you combine those two together uh

723
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,039
it looks like a teardrop

724
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,880
in the shape of the direction you're

725
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,200
pointing

726
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,840
so these are really great especially uh

727
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,559
i know some

728
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,080
amateur radio operators tend to use

729
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
these a lot for what's called eme

730
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,039
transmissions

731
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,960
that's earth moon earth of where you

732
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,400
effectively aim and signal

733
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,320
a real powerful signal at the moon and

734
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,080
literally bounce signals off of the moon

735
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,600
back to the earth

736
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,520
um and these antennas are the ones that

737
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,120
are used for doing a lot of that kind of

738
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,240
operation

739
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,400
uh long story short if you want highly

740
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
directional this is a really one great

741
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,840
one to go for

742
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,760
and of course here's a little bit more

743
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,440
continued so this explains a little bit

744
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,720
of what it looks like in

745
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,480
air it's still fairly hard to draw

746
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,559
three-dimensionally but you can see

747
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,240
that's the directionality that's the

748
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,640
lobes you'll see

749
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,400
and this is kind of how you put together

750
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,400
these pictures to create a 3d picture

751
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,080
log periodics this is a really

752
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,240
neat antenna i actually have one i have

753
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,559
a few of them right here

754
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,480
and this is one created by wa5 bjb

755
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,600
and he is a an amazing amazing uh

756
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,200
antenna designer uh he's done

757
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,400
crazy amazing work um but what's neat

758
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,200
about these

759
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,159
is they're back and forth so if you look

760
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,679
through here you'll see that there's

761
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,520
traces on both sides

762
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,840
but only the traces they're they're

763
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,720
interleaved on every other one

764
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,120
and what ends up happening with these

765
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,240
antennas

766
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,799
is they are good for the frequency from

767
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,679
the longest

768
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,679
to the shortest times meaning these

769
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,720
things are good

770
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,080
like for example the one i'm holding

771
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,000
right now is good from 400

772
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,320
megahertz to 1 000 megahertz or 1

773
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,840
gigahertz

774
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,200
so these cover a very very wide band um

775
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,799
and that of course is very useful

776
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,159
especially if you don't know quite what

777
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,360
frequencies you're going to be playing

778
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,240
around with

779
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,399
or what you're doing um

780
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,120
and this is what they look like and this

781
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,200
is how they compare with yachts

782
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,520
so the yogi didn't really discuss is in

783
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,720
terms of frequency

784
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,960
but yogi's are fairly narrow frequency

785
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,760
banded

786
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
so they're not good for a very big wide

787
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,279
frequency selection

788
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,399
log periodics however are good for all

789
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,760
of the frequencies in between of what

790
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,679
they're tuned for

791
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,399
so like for example this other one i

792
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,320
have here

793
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,240
this is a bit smaller one as well same

794
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,760
style though

795
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,520
this one is actually good from 850

796
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,480
megahertz to 6500 megahertz

797
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,960
so we get a very very wide coverage for

798
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,080
this little device right

799
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,880
this antenna right here um and that's

800
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,520
the nice thing

801
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,200
so if you don't know if you're if you're

802
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,960
working with signals and you say

803
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,840
you're going from 10 90 megahertz to

804
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,679
1200 megahertz

805
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,720
to 2.4 gigahertz um devices like this

806
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,640
are really really really handy

807
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,760
uh as you see the radiation patterns are

808
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,559
vertically they're they're still there

809
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,279
they're more

810
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,720
wide in the front and then they're kind

811
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,840
of scattered

812
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,919
horizontally effectively these are also

813
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,440
highly directional that's another thing

814
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
to keep in mind just like the yagi's

815
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
yogis and long periodics are both very

816
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,360
and i misspelled it at the very top

817
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,640
there i'll point this out

818
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,080
it says log parabolic it's supposed to

819
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,399
be log periodic i did spell it right at

820
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,879
the bottom

821
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,120
this is another antenna and this is

822
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,799
called a vivaldi

823
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,159
and i have one right here as well

824
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,320
and this one the vivaldi's are really

825
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,360
really neat

826
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,679
the frequency response has to go from

827
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,360
this tiniest little gap

828
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,399
right here all the way to out here what

829
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,640
this means is this antenna right here

830
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,600
actually goes from 1.5 gigahertz to 15

831
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,880
gigahertz

832
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,440
but as you see there from the radiation

833
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,159
pattern

834
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,360
it's also extremely directional um i've

835
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,039
seen these most the times

836
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,559
used on uh ground penetrating radar

837
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,039
i believe hackaday had a uh article a

838
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,919
little while back

839
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,120
about that of where they were using i

840
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,520
believe

841
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,399
four or more hack rf's with four or more

842
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,919
of these type of vivaldi's

843
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,200
and they were doing ground penetrating

844
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,960
radar to determine what was what

845
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,399
metallic objects are in the ground

846
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,840
beneath them

847
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,919
so highly directional a lot of very high

848
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,000
frequency response but unfortunately it

849
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,600
doesn't get you the low response

850
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,799
there's a lot of things in the lower

851
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,840
frequencies as well that are fun to play

852
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,840
with

853
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,000
we get we're also talking to helical

854
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
antennas

855
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,919
helical antennas are really neat so we

856
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,919
have

857
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,840
what these are for is

858
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,080
yeah actually that's a good way of

859
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,399
putting it so we have signals uh

860
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,159
that are horizontally polarized

861
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,760
and we have signals that are vertically

862
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
polarized and that's effectively where

863
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,679
is the signal effectively directed

864
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,520
is it uh horizontal is the signal going

865
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,720
to propagate uh

866
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,640
horizontally or is it going to propagate

867
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,000
vertically

868
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,039
uh and helical antennas are weird

869
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,399
because what they do is they actually

870
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,200
spin that e that electromagnetic

871
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,640
transmission

872
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,120
in the direction that their coil is

873
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,399
shaped

874
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,120
so what now what what would be that what

875
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,559
would that be good for

876
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,480
what that's good for is when you're on a

877
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,960
space station there isn't a vertical

878
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,799
there isn't a horizontal it's whatever

879
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,080
position you're

880
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,720
you're in and if a satellite is circling

881
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
the earth

882
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,080
there it vertical and horizontal don't

883
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
really make a sense

884
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,960
uh instead circular polarization

885
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,640
allows you to communicate of where it

886
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,000
spins the radio

887
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,840
the radio wave and allow us to

888
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,519
communicate and

889
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,720
the neat thing about that is you have

890
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,120
two types of ways of sort of polarizing

891
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,720
that you can do

892
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,880
right-handed polarization or you can do

893
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,640
left-handed polarization

894
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,679
and circular circular or

895
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,600
that's the type of polarizations now

896
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,679
most of things like the noaa satellites

897
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,120
and a lot of the amateur radio

898
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,240
satellites are

899
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,200
right-handed polarization and a lot of

900
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,919
the

901
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,679
spy satellites and a lot of the stuff

902
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,880
that you probably shouldn't listen to

903
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,120
are left-handed polarization

904
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,399
um so that's a thing to keep in mind you

905
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,000
can buy these antennas as well

906
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,840
or you can make them there's a lot of

907
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,279
guys out there on how to make them

908
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,799
if talking to space satellites

909
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,200
and talking to iss or talking to other

910
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,000
space stuff

911
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,159
is interesting to you then you'll want

912
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,200
to probably have a few

913
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,000
sets of these

914
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,919
the computers since software-defined

915
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,000
radio is a computer-based problem

916
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,600
we also need to discuss the computers

917
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,880
but there really isn't that much to

918
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,000
discuss

919
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,360
uh is but we do want usb3

920
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,600
and also we also don't want to run any

921
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,679
other usb devices on it because

922
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,360
your software defined radio is going to

923
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,440
eat that whole usb 3 bus

924
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,480
completely utterly

925
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,320
so if you have a webcam or whatever put

926
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,679
it on a different computer

927
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,279
it'll just cause your software to find

928
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,039
radio hardware to go blah

929
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,240
if you try to run a webcam the more cpu

930
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,519
the better

931
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,519
the more ram the better the ram allows

932
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,200
you to buffer all that extra data so

933
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
when you have a waterfall plot

934
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,360
and you show exa historical data for the

935
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,880
last 30 seconds

936
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,559
you'll actually be able to see it

937
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,240
elsewise you won't be able to show as

938
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,559
much

939
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,440
waterfall plot graphics cards are also

940
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,399
essential too

941
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,360
but primarily for the gnu radio and

942
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
that's going to be for opencl

943
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,559
acceleration of really really crazy

944
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,200
uh radio designs and then if you're

945
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,720
doing this over networking

946
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,600
do it over one gig or 10 gig ethernet

947
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,320
because

948
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,640
your performance you again just like the

949
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,760
usb 3 bus

950
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,279
you're going to chew through literally

951
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,120
all the performance that you have

952
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,840
and you're going to want more

953
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
so there's a lot of software available

954
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,240
to us

955
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
so we want to be able to do this but

956
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,000
there's there's a lot of choices to keep

957
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,559
in mind

958
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,240
what you're doing some things won't work

959
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,760
for what we're doing and we're having a

960
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,039
discussion about this as well

961
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,799
so operating systems and this is always

962
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,799
of course a big flame bait area my

963
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,080
operating system is better than your

964
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,000
operating system

965
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,159
my nickname is cranky linux user it's

966
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,760
not cranky windows user

967
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,000
so i primarily focus on the linux side

968
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,039
of things here

969
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,760
so i'm looking at raspbian that's a very

970
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,640
very nice

971
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,200
operating system for the raspberry pi

972
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,840
kali

973
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,640
which is more known in the defcon and

974
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,719
the hacker type circles and penetration

975
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,159
testing circles

976
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,239
they actually have the full complement

977
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,159
of software defined radio tools as well

978
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,599
as well and it is easy i like it

979
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,639
it's it's beautiful then there's also

980
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,440
pin 2

981
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,599
which is pushed by the wireless village

982
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,639
at defcon

983
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,399
i've never had experience with it but i

984
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,000
know a lot of people swear

985
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,199
by it with

986
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,960
the way in the speed of which software

987
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,199
defined radio advance is advancing

988
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,800
we're seeing commits every hour of

989
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
something completely new and interesting

990
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,960
and pin 2 can handle since it's a source

991
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
based installer or a source-based

992
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,079
operating system and not

993
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,280
the package based you can recompile

994
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,719
those packages so that you're always

995
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,760
current

996
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,320
now like i said i've never had uh usage

997
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,760
with it i always stuck with either kali

998
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,599
or raspbian so

999
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,200
i just wanted to give a mention a pin

1000
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,759
too as well

1001
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
reading signals uh this is one of my

1002
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,880
go-to tools i go to it called gqrx

1003
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,119
and this is a wonderful tool it gets you

1004
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,040
the the radio data

1005
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,119
up front and center you're able to surf

1006
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,480
around see what's going on

1007
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,800
how big the waveforms are what things

1008
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,400
are chatting

1009
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,880
you can also turn on different modes

1010
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,160
there's a few different decoders that

1011
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,040
you can turn on

1012
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,200
to decode for example fm radio am radio

1013
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,720
if you happen to find worse code

1014
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,880
stations or cw

1015
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,400
you can also turn on filters that would

1016
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,720
allow you to listen to that

1017
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,880
um but there's quite a few things there

1018
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,240
you can do

1019
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,720
and then you can also record the radio

1020
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,400
data as well and save it for a

1021
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,960
later time saving is also really useful

1022
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
for gdu radio

1023
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,240
because then you can just keep playing

1024
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,920
back the same sample again and again

1025
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,960
we're going to get to that in a minute

1026
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,359
another one this is more for the windows

1027
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,800
even though i didn't mention microsoft

1028
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,440
windows

1029
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,599
and the operating systems there is a lot

1030
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,000
of people who use microsoft windows for

1031
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,200
software to find radio and sdr sharp is

1032
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,920
frankly

1033
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,040
amazing it is the tool that you want it

1034
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,760
has tons and tons of decoders

1035
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,560
you can see tons of things here i don't

1036
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,839
have that much experience with it

1037
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,839
however i do know that there are

1038
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,760
somebody who figured out how to run sdr

1039
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,160
sharp

1040
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,680
on linux so this is not just a windows

1041
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,359
only tool

1042
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,280
but i want to make sure that people knew

1043
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,880
on the windows side that this is

1044
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,320
absolutely available and this is what

1045
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,720
you want

1046
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,440
this is a tool called sdr angel so this

1047
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:37,760
isn't

1048
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,920
this is for reading signals of course

1049
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,200
but this is also

1050
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,440
you can set it up to also transmit so

1051
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,880
this thing acts

1052
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,079
fairly similarly to like a tv

1053
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,200
broadcasting tool uh so there are

1054
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,960
different filters and depending on what

1055
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,640
what privileges and if you're an amateur

1056
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,320
radio operator you can transmit

1057
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,760
uh slow scan or fast skin video

1058
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,440
under the appropriate channels and this

1059
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,599
supports a lot of those video encoders a

1060
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,599
lot of video decoders

1061
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,640
um it's a little bit crashy

1062
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,720
uh if you try to make it do some weird

1063
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,160
things it will just

1064
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,440
fall apart and you have to close it and

1065
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,839
reopen everything but

1066
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,079
the this tool i've i've used if i wanted

1067
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,040
to transmit

1068
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,280
audio from a point to point over amateur

1069
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,480
radio frequencies

1070
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,440
i can do this legally and get my calls

1071
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,079
on

1072
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,040
this is a wonderful tool to use a

1073
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,960
downside of this is this thing will chew

1074
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,359
through cpu like it doesn't exist

1075
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,560
once it starts up i've seen my cpu

1076
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,119
eight core cpu just go completely 100

1077
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,720
across the board

1078
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,560
uh so be keep that in mind

1079
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,720
give it more cores give it more ram and

1080
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,359
it should be happy

1081
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,920
shiny sdr this is a really cool one if

1082
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,359
you have a home network

1083
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,599
and say you wanted to place your radio

1084
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,400
gear

1085
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,960
in the attic outside of your significant

1086
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,520
other's

1087
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,320
view so it isn't piled up in a horrible

1088
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,280
corner

1089
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,640
sorry i did that uh but if you want to

1090
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,880
position all your radio gear elsewhere

1091
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,960
uh this allows you to do a

1092
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,240
software-defined radio

1093
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,520
view over a web browser to a destination

1094
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,880
device so this is actually running a

1095
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
full web server

1096
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,880
is streaming the data to your endpoint

1097
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,240
um

1098
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,160
so this is really awesome if you need a

1099
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,760
remote presence for your software to

1100
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,880
find radio

1101
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,520
the downside for this is this thing will

1102
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,720
chew through a lot of

1103
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,240
resources on both machines i find that

1104
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,560
on

1105
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,720
at least the raspberry pi 3b plus that

1106
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,000
i've tested it on

1107
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,440
it doesn't have enough performance to be

1108
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,760
able to handle this effectively

1109
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,440
uh if i was to google with smaller

1110
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,280
waveforms it probably could

1111
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,839
uh i tried 20 megahertz in it it

1112
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,760
unfortunately had a very bad time

1113
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,320
um but you're able to do it if you have

1114
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:54,960
a better

1115
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,480
hardware platform you can have this

1116
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,320
position somewhere else in either your

1117
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,200
attic

1118
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,720
or positions outside in a weatherproof

1119
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,440
box

1120
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,920
and you can have that server doing doing

1121
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,200
the work there and then having it

1122
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,240
remoted in

1123
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,720
elsewhere from inside the house the

1124
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,440
other cool

1125
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,280
thing about the shiny sdr is it has a

1126
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,760
persistent waveform

1127
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,440
a lot of other tools i've discussed here

1128
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,040
for reading signals doesn't have the

1129
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,400
persistence

1130
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,560
um so when you shift channels and look

1131
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,240
around it will actually keep the

1132
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,200
existing data

1133
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,359
there and show you that you this is what

1134
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,480
you listened to previously

1135
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,599
get into a little bit of reverse

1136
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,560
engineering just so that people

1137
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,520
understand this is

1138
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,040
these are some of the tools that we also

1139
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,800
use to reverse signals because we're

1140
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,920
going to run across weird and

1141
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,640
interesting things

1142
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,000
especially when we start looking around

1143
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,079
here so this tool

1144
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,000
i adore it's called universal radio

1145
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,400
hacker this allows you to capture data

1146
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,000
from a variety of software-defined

1147
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,880
radios

1148
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,480
and then you're able to save it and then

1149
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,359
you can analyze it at a later date

1150
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,920
a few minutes after that and it also

1151
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,440
runs really nice about this is actually

1152
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,839
has auto detecting parameters so you can

1153
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,200
click a button right here

1154
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,520
right here and you can click that button

1155
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,400
and go try to figure it out for me and

1156
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,079
this is where you start getting into

1157
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,119
if you look there modulation uh it says

1158
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,720
fsk that's where you start getting into

1159
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,240
the frequency shift keying or the

1160
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,839
amplitude shift keying or the phase

1161
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,960
shift keying

1162
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,560
and it tries to figure those things out

1163
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,040
for you i mean it's not always perfect

1164
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,960
you know a lot of the software defined

1165
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,640
radius have never is

1166
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,880
perfect you got to figure you got to

1167
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,400
figure a little bit out

1168
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,520
but this allows you to look at the

1169
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,040
waveform figure out what kind of data is

1170
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,640
there and how to understand it

1171
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,920
and it even tries to help you at the

1172
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,160
bottom of that window even tries to help

1173
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,760
is like do you want to know what if it's

1174
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,599
bits do you want to know if it's ascii

1175
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,040

1176
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,640
how do you want me to decode it and then

1177
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,880
you can go further onto here but this is

1178
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,480
a great tool just to look at what's

1179
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,960
going on

1180
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,520
in spectrum this is another tool that's

1181
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,040
really really potent

1182
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,280
this doesn't use any radio hardware this

1183
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,400
only can analyze

1184
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,040
existing files you've already captured

1185
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,160
but this creates

1186
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,560
a humongous canvas something similar to

1187
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,000
like google earth

1188
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,920
that allows you to surf all through the

1189
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,280
spectrum and what's going

1190
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,359
on as you see here we're looking at a

1191
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,040
very high level of a signal

1192
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,200
but we can zoom all the way in down to

1193
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,319
the hurt

1194
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,960
the hurts

1195
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,160
and analyze what's going on and we can

1196
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,839
also select regions and say

1197
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,560
extract this data out of this region

1198
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,160
this tool is really really good for

1199
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,880
analysis

1200
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,839
after the fact

1201
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,119
and this is a fairly newer tool that i'm

1202
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,720
familiar with called sig

1203
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,000
digger and this is a similar interface

1204
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,440
to what we're familiar with on

1205
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,400
gqrx because that's what the creator

1206
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,680
said that that's what they wanted to

1207
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,640
make it after

1208
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,359
because the gqrx interface is just that

1209
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,240
nice

1210
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,920
but this is actually a combination of

1211
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,920
something like similar to gqrx

1212
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,720
and universal radio hacker it has other

1213
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,000
tools that can do automated

1214
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,880
detection of signals and try to figure

1215
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,480
out what kind of data is

1216
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
in that signal that you're dealing with

1217
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,520
now again it's not

1218
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,680
perfect but none of these tools ever

1219
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,280
will be perfect for the needs you'll

1220
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,119
have to hop around between a bunch of

1221
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,200
different things to analyze signals

1222
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,359
but i find i go to this as well quite a

1223
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,119
lot this will open up all my

1224
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,599
sdr hardware

1225
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,520
so i end up doing hitting this in

1226
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,280
universal radio hacker and in spectrum

1227
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,040
back and forth if i'm investigating new

1228
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,319
signals and interesting things

1229
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,280
i would also like to mention for those

1230
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,480
who i mentioned

1231
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,839
to that a raspberry pi could actually be

1232
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,119
a transmitter

1233
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,040
this is a dangerous one and i i debated

1234
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,599
whether to put this in this presentation

1235
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,160
uh but the raspberry pi it turns out can

1236
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,839
actually be modified with pin

1237
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,119
four to transmit radio

1238
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,800
as a software defined transmitter from

1239
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,000
10 kilohertz to 1.5 gigahertz

1240
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
this is an amazing thing so a lot of us

1241
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,280
have heard about the pi

1242
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,240
fm of where you can listen to a fm radio

1243
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,160
over your raspberry pi natively

1244
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,119
well this is actually a improvement on

1245
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,240
that code base

1246
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,599
that says hey we can turn this into a

1247
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,760
full transmitter stack

1248
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,560
now the dangers of this is you should

1249
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:24,960
never

1250
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
ever ever transmit on frequencies you

1251
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,240
don't have permission to

1252
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,440
and if you don't know what they are

1253
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,920
don't transmit uh and the next thing is

1254
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,960
is the data or the radio waves

1255
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,599
that this thing generates is not very

1256
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,040
clean

1257
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,720
um so we recommend uh never to ever ever

1258
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,480
transmit without a bandpass filter so

1259
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,440
you need to actually

1260
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,720
if you know what frequency you're

1261
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,960
transmitting on you create a filter that

1262
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,920
only allows that

1263
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,560
narrow sliver of spectrum to transmit

1264
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,000
elsewhere is what you're going to do is

1265
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,040
you're going to splatter

1266
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,079
radio junk all around and it's going to

1267
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,000
make a sad time for a lot of people if

1268
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,520
they rely on that part that's part of

1269
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,280
frequency

1270
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,839
so this is useful but it's also could be

1271
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,599
very very dangerous

1272
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,280
please please keep in mind and watch

1273
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,440
uh whether with an rtl sdr or something

1274
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,800
similar about

1275
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:22,000
if you're doing unintended emissions

1276
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,760
so we have advanced tools here uh this

1277
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,720
tends to scare people uh so this is

1278
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,359
radio

1279
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,960
and this software that we're looking at

1280
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,200
here is called gnu radio companion

1281
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,280
so what makes guinea radio so powerful

1282
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,800
is that there's hundreds of different

1283
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,760
plugins uh blocks that you see each

1284
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,960
block has its own

1285
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,960
plugin and you're able to create

1286
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,160
a whole radio from this so on this case

1287
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,079
right here i have the pluto sdr

1288
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,560
source so this thing is is looking at

1289
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,960
the the rx or the receive

1290
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,200
of my pluto and right now this is

1291
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,119
something very simple i'm just

1292
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,680
giving out the uh show me a waterfall of

1293
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,200
that frequency

1294
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,680
and i'm looking at 2.4 gigahertz and you

1295
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,720
can look down the

1296
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,160
list here of what i'm looking at

1297
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,000
but the key behind this is is you can

1298
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,839
build extremely complicated radio

1299
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,680
front-ends we call them front-ends but

1300
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,359
we can build a whole complex radio and

1301
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,160
software with this tool

1302
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,119
what makes this so daunting is that you

1303
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,960
have to effectively have a

1304
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,680
minor in digital signal processing and

1305
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,880
you have to understand what the

1306
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,920
transforms are

1307
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,480
and how those things work there are ways

1308
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,160
to get around that and to learn

1309
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,280
quickly uh but this is certainly not a

1310
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,319
two-hour bring you up to stuff

1311
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,359
i believe the folks at the who made the

1312
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:44,560
hack rf the

1313
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,599
great gadgets they have a exceptional

1314
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,839
video series i think 10 hours long

1315
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,520
that covers the basic fundamentals of

1316
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,200
goody radio and it's

1317
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
it's a wonderful introduction it gets

1318
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,960
you up and running

1319
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,200
the other thing to keep in mind is that

1320
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,560
gnu radio companion

1321
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,000
in gnu radio is python

1322
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,280
now i know i'm looking at the a little

1323
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,680
bit older i'm where i'm using python 2.

1324
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,040
i know i shouldn't be it should be

1325
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,119
python3

1326
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,720
but all this code that this whole thing

1327
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,560
generates is actually a

1328
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,920
python program so you can actually run

1329
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,560
this

1330
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,560
and you can look at it how it's working

1331
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,079
in python so if you're if you're well

1332
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,440
versed in that language

1333
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,839
now this should be right at home and

1334
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,280
that's what makes good radio

1335
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,800
and radio companions so wonderful it's

1336
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,560
it gets out of the way for you when you

1337
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,160
want to get it out of the way so i can

1338
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,119
add it into something

1339
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,280
another project and integrate it and

1340
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,800
keep on going with something really cool

1341
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
this is a tool that i came across a

1342
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,760
little while back i believe it was

1343
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,440
created by the nsa

1344
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,880
the national security agency

1345
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,280
and this tool is called redhawk so this

1346
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,240
tool is

1347
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,040
something similar to the new radio as

1348
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,599
you see

1349
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,560
we still have the blocks uh but it has

1350
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,440
waveforms

1351
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,800
a little bit different positioning and

1352
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,359
such the really cool thing about this

1353
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,680
is this will handle multiple receivers

1354
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,920
multiple transmitters

1355
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,880
as one concert so we're not looking at

1356
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,079
like if i have three

1357
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,640
rtl sdrs i don't have to do individually

1358
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,839
each of those three

1359
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,920
i can treat them as one logical radio

1360
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,599
device and do really cool stuff with

1361
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,480
them

1362
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,240
i still haven't done much of anything

1363
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,079
with redhawk because it's also very hard

1364
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,240
to install

1365
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,400
the installs are for i believe primarily

1366
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,680
centos

1367
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,559
linux and nothing else that my

1368
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,079
experiences

1369
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,680
i really need to get to this tool and

1370
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,359
take a look around because there's some

1371
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,280
the synthesis of adding all those radius

1372
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,599
together to create one massive radio

1373
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,240
array

1374
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,760
is frankly very alluring so i wanted to

1375
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,640
make sure everyone knew about that

1376
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,760
this is a tool that i use that's not sdr

1377
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,960
this is a tool called node red and node

1378
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,440
red

1379
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,960
is a obviously node gives it a

1380
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,559
it gives a hint away it's actually based

1381
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,119
off of the node.js ecosystem

1382
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,520
and this is a drag and drop plug-in

1383
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,319
based

1384
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,599
programmer so you can create programs

1385
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,800
either in javascript

1386
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,200
manually with function blocks or you can

1387
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,640
very quickly create

1388
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,160
chains of tools to connect your

1389
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,240
software-defined radio data

1390
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,400
and say add it to twitter add it to

1391
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
facebook or add it to whatever

1392
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,400
and i find this tool to be effective

1393
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,400
glue quick glue code if i'm doing a

1394
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,079
quick test to figure out

1395
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,480
can i do this really neat thing and i'll

1396
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,680
just whip something together in five

1397
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,119
minutes with this tool

1398
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,960
now this does run as a server and client

1399
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,400
so this is actually a picture of the

1400
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,040
browser that it runs in

1401
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,520
but i find this tool to be essential for

1402
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,520
quick hacks

1403
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,720
you don't want to rely on this for

1404
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,280
anything production level stuff but

1405
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,440
it i find it to be exceptional for that

1406
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,839
purpose

1407
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,640
so we have sdr projects and that's kind

1408
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,319
of what we were all here today for

1409
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,839
is what kind of projects what can you do

1410
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,000
with this uh with the software defined

1411
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,280
radios

1412
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,040
i wanted to go over quite a few of the

1413
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,720
projects and a few of them i've actually

1414
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,119
built

1415
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,880
myself um this is a really cool one

1416
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,040
is is an airplane detector so we're

1417
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,200
actually this is something called

1418
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,920
adsb and adsb

1419
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,319
is a protocol that airplane the

1420
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,160
airplanes are required to have hardware

1421
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,440
transponders

1422
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,839
that chirp their call sign for their

1423
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:32,880
aircraft

1424
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,559
that chirps their their gps position

1425
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,280
and their heading and their speed and

1426
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,240
they have to do this

1427
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,440
at a regular basis and it turns out the

1428
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,880
it's actually runs on uh 1090 gigahertz

1429
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,400
and an rtl sdr the 15 dollar radio radio

1430
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,359
sdr receiver

1431
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,359
can actually pick this data up pretty

1432
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,400
effectively

1433
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,240
and then you can paint that data on the

1434
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,079
dashboard so you can report it online to

1435
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,040
different services

1436
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,280
you can do a lot of things with that and

1437
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,800
this tool is actually called virtual

1438
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,079
radar server

1439
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,559
so what this tool does you can run this

1440
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,000
and this actually

1441
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,720
paints it directly on to google map a

1442
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,520
google maps

1443
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,000
page and it shows you the altitude it

1444
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,440
shows you the heading shows you all the

1445
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,319
good stuff

1446
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,440
shows you who owns that aircraft

1447
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,319
so if you're interested in aeronautic or

1448
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:24,800
uh

1449
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,920
like aeronautics like this this tool is

1450
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,480
a cheap easy way to get into this uh

1451
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,880
realm

1452
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,240
so ik i live in the middle of indiana

1453
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,520
there's not much ocean around here so

1454
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,880
but aside from that we there is the same

1455
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,520
thing

1456
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,160
for ships as well and that's called ship

1457
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:48,720
plotter

1458
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,000
and it's its own uh it's similar to adsb

1459
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,839
from the aircraft side of things

1460
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:54,880
obviously they're going to be moving a

1461
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,880
lot slower

1462
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,640
but we have the similar kind of radio

1463
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,079
transponders that do the same

1464
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,880
same things now the software here is

1465
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,200
ship

1466
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,319
plotter unfortunately it is paywear

1467
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,359
but it works very very well uh if you

1468
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,200
live near big bodies of water that you

1469
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,760
could act

1470
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,720
you could use this software um so that's

1471
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,000
another thing to keep in mind if you're

1472
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,040
interested in

1473
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,119
ship travels ship functions if you're on

1474
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,480
the coast

1475
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,319
of any country in the world it's always

1476
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,319
fun to see what's going on out there

1477
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,280
we have a music emergency communications

1478
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,920
uh this is a really really fun and deep

1479
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,599
area this protocol is called p25

1480
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,240
and this is called trunked radio of

1481
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:40,640
where

1482
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,559
the basic idea how this works is you

1483
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:43,760
have a control

1484
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,640
a computer channel if you will and

1485
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,000
that's your traffic

1486
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,160
traffic controller and then you have all

1487
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,640
your clients that have handsets

1488
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,200
and when they press the button they talk

1489
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,720
to the control channel

1490
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,559
and they get told okay go on to channel

1491
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,720
15 that channel is empty and available

1492
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,160
for you to use

1493
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,880
and this is what you'll find a lot of uh

1494
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,520
police

1495
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,040
a lot of fire a lot of ems use

1496
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,200
to do coordinations for emergency

1497
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,680
services

1498
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,520
this tool that i prefer to use is called

1499
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,960
trunk recorder although there's quite a

1500
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,440
few

1501
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,720
p25 decoding tools

1502
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,559
and then the software i like to use as a

1503
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:23,760
web service is called trunk

1504
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,359
player now keep in mind here with p25

1505
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,520
there is unencrypted and encrypted

1506
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,280
variants of that

1507
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,760
so even though you may set up p25

1508
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,640
receiver

1509
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,760
you may not be able to decrypt the p25

1510
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,240
traffic if they choose to encrypt it uh

1511
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,800
now p25 is also a little special that we

1512
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,240
have to keep in mind that there are

1513
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,920
in some jurisdictions there are laws

1514
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,520
saying that you can't have

1515
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,720
a uh emergency communications reporter

1516
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,680
in your car yeah you like for at least

1517
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,040
here in indiana

1518
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,520
we i can have it here at the house but i

1519
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,839
can't take it into my car

1520
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:02,079
because listening to police transpo

1521
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,839
police transmissions while you're

1522
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,119
driving is not considered

1523
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,000
a legal thing to do here uh so the you

1524
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,440
have to check to make sure what laws are

1525
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,960
available in your jurisdiction

1526
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,079
to do this in your car or in person

1527
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,880
um i have set this up there are some

1528
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,400
carve outs for certain people i've

1529
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,520
helped some journalists

1530
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,160
set the p-25 system up they're one of

1531
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,400
the exempted peoples to do that

1532
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,480
but just keep in mind that this does

1533
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,839
touch the law a little bit

1534
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,960
this is a really cool one there's no

1535
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,520
picture but this is called the itron

1536
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,880
data recorder

1537
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,599
and it's related off of the rtl amr

1538
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:40,400
package

1539
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,880
now that sounds like a whole bunch of

1540
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,559
word gibberish

1541
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,359
but what that actually relates to is

1542
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:48,880
there's quite a few of us who have

1543
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,160
access to

1544
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,160
uh wireless power recording from the

1545
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,520
power company that we purchase

1546
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,680
electricity from and they don't want to

1547
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,040
send people out to measure how much

1548
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,480
power you've used for the week or for

1549
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,760
the month or whatever

1550
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,400
so they install these uh devices that

1551
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,920
allow them to wirelessly

1552
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,000
uh get how much power you you've used

1553
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,960
and it's actually using an itron

1554
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,400
encoding

1555
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,839
and this data isn't encrypted or

1556
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,599
anything it's not hidden away from you

1557
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:16,559
intentionally

1558
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,640
but you can use this data recorder to

1559
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,160
actually record how much power your

1560
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,160
households used

1561
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,839
and of course once we have access to

1562
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:26,079
that we can do a ton of things with that

1563
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,920
now do you have devices that are eating

1564
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,680
power more power than you thought

1565
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,040
we can see that real time on our

1566
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,480
dashboard because they chirp back every

1567
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,480
30 seconds every minute

1568
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,720
um if do we have any electricity

1569
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,760
electrical leaks

1570
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,119
we can see that uh are we not using

1571
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,079
enough power

1572
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,680
or are there devices that are

1573
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,280
misbehaving

1574
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,119
i know a lot of times i've seen some of

1575
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,599
the large screen tvs

1576
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,680
their standby mode still uses tons of

1577
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,680
power so we can actually catch that in

1578
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,280
the act

1579
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,880
but being able to see all that data

1580
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,799
allows us to make decisions

1581
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:02,160
further down the line and of course we

1582
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,839
can take this data as well and combine

1583
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,680
it with node red and do some really cool

1584
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,880
things overall

1585
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,680
which is why i mentioned node red but

1586
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,440
unfortunately it's it's a text only

1587
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,160
protocol

1588
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,400
for the data recording so there's no

1589
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,359
pretty picture to show

1590
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,160
there's this really awesome project here

1591
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,680
called local radio

1592
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,720
so local radio is a it uses

1593
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,520
either one or multiple rtl sdrs and it

1594
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,799
allows you to capture

1595
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,839
a lot of radio stations at once and then

1596
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,760
be able to listen to them in a dashboard

1597
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,559
in a web browser

1598
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,559
and my cat is deciding to come say hi

1599
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,520
no kiki

1600
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,319
so this allows you to have for example

1601
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,480
if you have a hack rf and that

1602
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,319
gives you a 20 megahertz window of

1603
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:51,920
listening uh

1604
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,240
fm radio the fm broadcast the radio

1605
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,760
stations that we listen to

1606
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,559
in the us is from 88 megahertz to 108

1607
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,960
megahertz

1608
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,960
and with a hack rf you can actually

1609
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,079
listen to that whole

1610
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,680
chunk of spectrum at the same time

1611
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,839
yes kiki you are a wonderful cat

1612
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,640
so that allows you to listen to the

1613
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,400
whole spectrum at one time but you

1614
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,920
obviously can't listen to

1615
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,480
every radio station i i'm not data from

1616
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,079
next the star trek next generation i

1617
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,400
can't listen to all of them at once

1618
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,720
but our devices that can listen to them

1619
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,839
can do that

1620
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,520
and we have different more people in

1621
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,680
this house that i can listen to mpr

1622
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,119
somebody else can listen to a classic

1623
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,960
rock station or whatever

1624
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,000
and we can stream and capture all those

1625
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,839
channels at the exact same time

1626
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,680
and put it over a local service here at

1627
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,359
the house

1628
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,280
so local radio is really cool for being

1629
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,000
able to do that

1630
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,760
something completely different is

1631
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,400
actually radio astronomy

1632
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,599
this is not my forte i have to admit uh

1633
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,280
but there's quite a few people who have

1634
00:56:59,280 --> 00:56:59,920
used

1635
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,079
rtl sdrs and other software-defined

1636
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:03,200
radios to do

1637
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,240
hydrogen line astronomy uh with homemade

1638
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,319
and home-built equipment now like i said

1639
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,079
this isn't my forte but i know quite a

1640
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,359
few people who have done this

1641
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,319
and software-defined radio opens up this

1642
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,319
radio astronomy for the masses

1643
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,759
which is really frankly awesome

1644
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,960
another interesting area is detection

1645
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,400
of spy stuff so there's actually a piece

1646
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,559
of software called salamandra

1647
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,880
that what it does is it actually uses

1648
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,640
two things together it uses a

1649
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,040
speaker and then it uses a software

1650
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,599
defined radio like an rtl sdr

1651
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,640
and it does is it goes up the frequency

1652
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,160
in a group like that

1653
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,160
and it emits that over the speaker in

1654
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,599
the area and then it

1655
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,799
then looks at the rtl sdr data coming in

1656
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,559
and it correlates and says hey i found

1657
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,559
this same signature

1658
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,440
in this radio spectrum i think i found

1659
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,680
the spy microphone

1660
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,000
so this is a really cool for finding

1661
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,760
spine microphones

1662
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,440
and this can actually come in handy

1663
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,720
especially uh if you do like airbnbs

1664
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,760
uh if you do uh and hotel uh

1665
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,760
we're not doing as much with coven but

1666
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,040
this is still a concern you know are

1667
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,559
there spy things going on and this is a

1668
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:19,760
tool that was meant for

1669
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,839
detecting spy stuff

1670
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,040
another really cool area which is

1671
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,559
completely different from

1672
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,200
a standard software-defined radio is

1673
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,359
reprogramming the software-defined radio

1674
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,119
to turn it into a wi-fi

1675
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,240
chipset so this is something called open

1676
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,599
wi-fi

1677
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,760
and the purpose behind this is there's

1678
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,960
these chips on

1679
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,079
a lot of the more expensive

1680
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,319
software-defined radios called the

1681
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:49,920
fpgas and they're think of them

1682
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,799
think of them as programmable hardware

1683
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,319
you send it to a program and you can

1684
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:55,599
actually reconfigure the internal

1685
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,119
hardware to make it whatever you want to

1686
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:57,760
do

1687
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,160
and in this case this firmware is called

1688
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,839
open wi-fi and it creates

1689
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:05,599
a wi-fi front end that

1690
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,440
it acts like its own wireless chip set

1691
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,599
now why would you want to do this that

1692
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,760
opens up a complete chain that you know

1693
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,640
exactly how

1694
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,280
data goes from your computer from a file

1695
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,440
to the actual radio ways because you can

1696
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,480
track it

1697
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,240
because the code is all available and

1698
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,119
open so this opens up a lot of wi-fi

1699
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,799
experimentation

1700
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:28,880
uh i know a while back on hackaday there

1701
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,119
were some discussions about the esp

1702
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,160
12. and adjusting clock clock rates and

1703
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,040
adjusting the white

1704
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,880
the the width of the wireless signal

1705
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,680
and changing it by half and doing really

1706
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,799
neat things and height

1707
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:44,720
and hiding wi-fi and re-encoding it in

1708
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,799
different ways and this open wi-fi

1709
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:48,400
platform really enables a lot of those

1710
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,760
kind of experimentation

1711
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,880
and being on the edge of that kind of

1712
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,760
computation

1713
00:59:53,760 --> 01:00:00,079
and radio experimentation

1714
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,480
and as for ethics i didn't cover a few

1715
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,640
things and these are intentional

1716
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,240
uh pagers uh pagers are

1717
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,839
trivial don't listen to them

1718
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:14,880
it's not worth it it's just bad uh

1719
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,640
cell phones i won't touch cell phones

1720
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,079
with a 10 foot pole and neither should

1721
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:18,799
you

1722
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:21,599
uh if you happen to have a rf lab and

1723
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,720
that you have a complete

1724
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,119
shielded and approved from the sec to do

1725
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,920
so then you can experiment in there

1726
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,599
elsewhy is the ftc if they catch you

1727
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,440
with cell phone stuff

1728
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,680
they are unhappy uh satellite phone

1729
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,799
services as well

1730
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:38,400
those were launched before a lot of the

1731
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,040
good encryption took place

1732
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,640
so again they're not very secure but

1733
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,880
don't listen to them and the last thing

1734
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,440
i also won't discuss here is malfeasance

1735
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,599
uh obviously i don't have a problem with

1736
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,040
with experimenting with your own

1737
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,880
hardware you own

1738
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,559
but there's a lot more radio gear out

1739
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,000
there that you can cause some pretty

1740
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,680
severe damage to if you know what you're

1741
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,480
doing

1742
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,319
and i don't want to encourage that kind

1743
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:05,359
of activity at all

1744
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,880
and remember if you do accidentally come

1745
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,160
across something

1746
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,680
try to give the others the privacy that

1747
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,040
you would want in case you did find

1748
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,240
something you didn't mean to

1749
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,559
walk away from it ignore it delete it

1750
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:19,760
stop

1751
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,480
uh and last thing too is if you do come

1752
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,000
across hardware that you're

1753
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,440
experimenting with that you

1754
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,359
own and you find a vulnerability in it

1755
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,440
because of the nature of radio hardware

1756
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,280
hacking in zero days

1757
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,359
are very hard to repair in this realm

1758
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,920
because most of most radio devices don't

1759
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,319
use

1760
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,559
software defined radio because it

1761
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,000
requires a lot of big cpu

1762
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,040
ram and such so making any

1763
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,599
zero days that open up something is very

1764
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,920
hard to patch

1765
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,720
so be careful what you release for as a

1766
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,240
case in point here

1767
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,559
the fda had a zero day dropped at defcon

1768
01:01:58,559 --> 01:01:59,440
a few years ago

1769
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,640
about a uh pacemaker

1770
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,839
that was vulnerable and the organization

1771
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,280
that gave that

1772
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,319
zero day was

1773
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,319
they did so in a respectful way they

1774
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:13,599
didn't tell what device it was or

1775
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:14,799
anything they said this these are

1776
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:15,680
vulnerable

1777
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,000
then the problem is as the fda said in

1778
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,599
order to replace and fix these we have

1779
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,640
to open people up for open heart surgery

1780
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,359
so the danger is you're you have a zero

1781
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:26,480
day that you're vulnerable to

1782
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,480
but it's even just as dangerous to have

1783
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,160
somebody opened up on surgery

1784
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,079
to go fix it so this is the kind of

1785
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,119
thing that we have to consider

1786
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,480
especially with this kind of

1787
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,839
area of discussion

1788
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,720
so i have a bit of a qa here and also

1789
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,680
wanted to show off some

1790
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,960
new radio basics

1791
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,559
do we have any questions so far

1792
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:01,039
um i think yes

1793
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,599
there are a few people who have some

1794
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:04,559
questions

1795
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:07,520
i gotta go through it and find them the

1796
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,039
latest one is what about hacking

1797
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,720
biosensors or fitbit

1798
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:15,760
devices that's a question from

1799
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,799
carcass melters

1800
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,240
i'll have to be honest i've ne i don't

1801
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,839
have a fitbit

1802
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,640
uh i've looked at some of the biosensors

1803
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,200
uh

1804
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,079
a lot of the biosensors i've seen they

1805
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,599
focus

1806
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,880
more on like bluetooth low energy

1807
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,039
in those cases there's a lot of

1808
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,039
bluetooth low energy modifications you

1809
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,420
can do

1810
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,520
[Music]

1811
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,359
there is also hacking as well but if you

1812
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,839
have legit access to that device

1813
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:47,200
then you have to only determine what

1814
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,520
protocols under the bluetooth low energy

1815
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,359
what they're doing and there's a lot of

1816
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,039
different guides i'm not really focusing

1817
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:53,839
on bluetooth

1818
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:56,480
here specifically our bluetooth low

1819
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,400
energy as well but there's a lot of

1820
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,240
guides on how to decipher and how those

1821
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,839
things work

1822
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:05,599
um i see why

1823
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,799
so why doesn't pluto play nice with kali

1824
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:13,039
i'm using i believe the 2004

1825
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:16,079
kali it's a fresh install and it seemed

1826
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:19,119
to work pretty well

1827
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,640
uh okay so when you see a signal appear

1828
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,880
on gqrx how do you determine what the

1829
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,880
modulation is

1830
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,400
oh gosh okay let me part of it is

1831
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,160
luck and part of it let me go back to my

1832
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,480
presentation here

1833
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:41,839
uh share a screen

1834
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,759
okay

1835
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:55,839
and

1836
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:59,520
so this is kind of the basics of what

1837
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,280
modulations i'm looking at

1838
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,880
so the well first off is it an analog or

1839
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,559
is it going to be a digital

1840
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,720
uh most likely if we're looking at a

1841
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,760
computer to computer

1842
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,039
that's always going to be a digital

1843
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,440
modulation so we're going to be down

1844
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:13,839
this

1845
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:16,240
chart and then we have to look at one of

1846
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,680
these three

1847
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,440
uh amplitude shift keying frequency

1848
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,160
shift keying and phase shift keying

1849
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,200
and on here we have a

1850
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,440
they call this a voltage over time but

1851
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,280
we have data encoded here

1852
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:32,880
so high is one low is zero

1853
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,280
and then we have the carrier and we have

1854
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,520
this data going through here

1855
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,680
so kind of what i do is i roughly match

1856
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,760
it up to what i'm expecting so if i'm

1857
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,160
looking for an amplitude shift keying

1858
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,359
i'm going to see waves

1859
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,720
that look something similar to this

1860
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,440
if you see a signal coming in of where

1861
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,720
instead of the waves

1862
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,599
being compressed and expanded vertically

1863
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:56,319
you see it

1864
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,799
compressed time wise of where it's the

1865
01:05:58,799 --> 01:05:59,920
same strength

1866
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,760
in terms of the amplitude that's going

1867
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,440
to be a frequency or it's going to be a

1868
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,640
phase

1869
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,400
if i see them flipping back and forth a

1870
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,319
lot like this of where the direction of

1871
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,319
the wave literally goes halfway through

1872
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:11,440
and then flips

1873
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,119
that's i'm going to be suspecting a

1874
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,799
phase shift keying

1875
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:18,319
um this is kind of the basics of what i

1876
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:19,359
look for

1877
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,599
uh and a lot of times when you start

1878
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,359
adding in a lot a lot of data

1879
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,599
it's going to be a lot harder to tell

1880
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:26,960
but the key signs between

1881
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,839
at least between amplitude and frequency

1882
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:30,480
is

1883
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,240
does it change its amplitude or not

1884
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,559
that's a good way to tell between this

1885
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:37,520
amplitude or

1886
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,240
frequency or phase um the phase is kind

1887
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,680
of the weird one

1888
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,960
in this and and phase is usually used in

1889
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,079
conjunction with something else

1890
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:49,520
that's a lot of times what we'll see

1891
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,759
there

1892
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,599
okay

1893
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:02,079
there was another question from grandma

1894
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:06,160
way way ago and uh he asked i think it

1895
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,599
was at the presentation where he showed

1896
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,680
like some tools and some files

1897
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,599
and he asked like are these files for

1898
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,520
file formats compatible with different

1899
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,839
tools

1900
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,240
i'm i miss part of that you're coming in

1901
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,280
a little

1902
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,720
harder so dramatic

1903
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,920
 asked before it was it's some time

1904
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:30,559
ago

1905
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:33,119
if those file formats that you showed if

1906
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:33,760
they are

1907
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,400
compatible with different tools oh oh

1908
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,520
yes the actual

1909
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,039
so the iq data captures

1910
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:44,079
um yes uh

1911
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:47,039
give me one moment here let me go ahead

1912
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:47,839
and get one

1913
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:57,839
up and i will show it

1914
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:11,839
and

1915
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,399
so he added there's like interoper

1916
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:20,399
interoperability of tools between the

1917
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:23,600
yeah actually what i find

1918
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,359
very refreshing is the interoperability

1919
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,640
of the data formats are very good

1920
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,520
so let me go ahead okay

1921
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:39,839
there and let me open up a file here

1922
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:48,879
so this file i'm opening up in spectrum

1923
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:51,198
it's lagging a little bit because this

1924
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:54,799
is a ton of data here

1925
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,839
are you able to see that

1926
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:14,319
i think it's yeah now

1927
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,839
i can feel like a flickering a bluish

1928
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:21,679
uh turkey ish

1929
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,520
and that's what these signals are is

1930
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,279
this is a humongous

1931
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:28,799
water fall plot uh that shows all the

1932
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,000
signals

1933
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,839
in the signal now the problem with this

1934
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,759
file is this file is a half a gigabyte

1935
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:34,479
big

1936
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:36,960
and this was about four seconds of data

1937
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,000
capture

1938
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,839
uh that's the kind of the scale of the

1939
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:42,158
of the size of files we're talking about

1940
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:45,920
um however the files themselves

1941
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,920
are fairly compatible with all other

1942
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,679
signal tools so you can take this from

1943
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,679
goody radio

1944
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,120
you can take this back and forth within

1945
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,280
spectrum with gqrx

1946
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,840
you name it

1947
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,159
okay uh i see uh larry sure

1948
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,480
asked why the pi three b plus and not pi

1949
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,600
four

1950
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,239
i actually have to admit that today

1951
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,040
because

1952
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,719
uh everest is the one who does the rpi

1953
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:17,840
tx library just released

1954
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,960
a beta update that does work

1955
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,080
uh software-defined transmit for the rpi

1956
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,640
uh the raspberry pi 4. so my

1957
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,600
presentation

1958
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,199
wasn't updated as of today when he

1959
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,120
dropped the newest update

1960
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,800
which is awesome because that enables

1961
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,199
every raspberry pi

1962
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:38,000
created to be able to transmit as a

1963
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,960
software-defined transmitter

1964
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,840
uh probably different radios for the

1965
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,600
wi-fi module actually we're not using

1966
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,400
this is where

1967
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,719
the raspberry pi is really strange here

1968
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:54,640
is we're not transmitting using the

1969
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,320
wi-fi module in a raspberry pi

1970
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,560
for the software to find transmit we're

1971
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,320
actually using the gpo

1972
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,440
or the gpu clock pin which is pin

1973
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,480
4 as the transmitter we're not using

1974
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,840
anything of the

1975
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,880
of the broadcom wireless chipset at all

1976
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,640
we could turn that off and in fact it's

1977
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,960
a good idea to turn it off

1978
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,800
because there are some weirdnesses that

1979
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,440
occur with how the transmit of the

1980
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,199
software defined radio transmit works um

1981
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:25,440
yeah i'm sorry it's redrawing so i think

1982
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,400
it's partially because i

1983
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,199
also have compiz on one of those linux

1984
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,519
geeks

1985
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,920
for some reason the pluto doesn't get an

1986
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,840
ip address uh

1987
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,320
okay so for the pluto uh let me show you

1988
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,960
uh where do i have that at

1989
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,239
okay so for the pluto and i'm gonna hold

1990
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:44,880
it up here

1991
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,239
like this as you see there there's

1992
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:51,600
two jacks occasionally what i found

1993
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,480
is some usb doesn't provide enough power

1994
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,560
to actually run this device effectively

1995
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,000
so what you do is on the one with the

1996
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,480
usb

1997
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,800
symbol you plug in data and the other

1998
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,960
one you plug it into power into the wall

1999
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,560
and that will give it enough power to be

2000
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,719
able to transmit and receive and turn on

2001
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:09,520
correctly

2002
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,120
and that's when you should see

2003
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,559
everything come up and be happy

2004
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:23,839
ah example receiver path

2005
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,440
what's a good way to start beginning an

2006
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,120
engineering project for someone new to

2007
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,880
sdr and not a lot of programming

2008
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,080
experience

2009
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,199
um a lot of times

2010
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:35,360
what's good about that is to dip your

2011
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,520
feet into the pool if you will

2012
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,199
uh for example some of the tools that i

2013
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,280
discussed earlier uh for example

2014
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,159
uh adsb so let's say where you want to

2015
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,640
record all the planes flying overhead

2016
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,480
and when i say overhead i'm not saying

2017
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,080
just literally in an

2018
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,239
area above me i'm talking about i've

2019
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:54,080
been able to reach 30 and 40 and 50

2020
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,360
miles away

2021
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,920
playing slime diagonally further away

2022
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,280
from me like that

2023
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,840
um so we're able to get and that will

2024
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,040
give us the data coming

2025
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,080
in and then we from there what do we

2026
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,440
want to do with it do we want to

2027
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,760
paint it to a map we want to ship it off

2028
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,199
to another service

2029
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,719
uh there's quite a few things out there

2030
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,320
i think there's flight aware there's a

2031
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,320
few other services that will accept your

2032
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,199
data coming in

2033
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:22,960
and you can play with that also you can

2034
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,440
also mess with it with scr you can also

2035
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,600
with a raspberry pi

2036
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,600
if you combine a raspberry pi with the

2037
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,600
rpi tx library

2038
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,640
and a let's say a uh

2039
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,360
rtl sdr you actually have a full receive

2040
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,320
and transmit stack

2041
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,960
with both of those devices combined so

2042
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,560
if you wanted to you play as long as

2043
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,159
you're an amateur radio operator and

2044
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:47,520
working within those bands

2045
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,080
and have the proper filter um you can

2046
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,040
create

2047
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,280
your own radio protocols and do radio on

2048
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,800
both sides

2049
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,040
and canoe radio is mostly drag and drop

2050
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:57,920
it is not

2051
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,800
easy uh but you can definitely

2052
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,679
experiment

2053
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,040
failure is painless on that because

2054
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,239
there's nothing you can really do to

2055
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,280
cause damage with

2056
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,760
new radio so you can play with it if it

2057
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,360
doesn't work you go back to it you try

2058
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,840
it again you keep trying again until it

2059
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,480
works

2060
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,840
uh word now uh i think it's in m

2061
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,400
uh were there any focuses of what you're

2062
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,440
interested in

2063
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,159
looking like uh like what you know a lot

2064
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,800
of times i find that

2065
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,760
the impetus to go wanes if it's not

2066
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,280
something you're interested in

2067
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,080
do you have a focus of what you're going

2068
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:34,480
for

2069
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,919
what are you trying to do with radio

2070
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,840
stuff

2071
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,640
so before i think there was an

2072
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,480
interesting question by enrico

2073
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,719
um i don't see a way um i don't see a

2074
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,320
way ton of

2075
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,280
oh sorry i missed the question um yeah

2076
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,360
exactly when you see a signal appear on

2077
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,199
gqrx how do you determine what the

2078
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,000
modulation is

2079
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,199
yes uh and that's part of it is a

2080
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,480
guesstimate

2081
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,960
uh part of it is also realizing what

2082
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:09,679
we're looking at

2083
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:10,960
let me see if i can share my screen on

2084
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,199
my other computer here

2085
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:16,560
give me one moment here i will try to

2086
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:24,880
show it to you um

2087
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,159
okay connected

2088
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:32,320
i'm going to disable my video feed here

2089
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,440
uh how do i do that

2090
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,520
okay so i'm still going gonna be on the

2091
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,280
video chat i'm gonna share on my screen

2092
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,080
on my other one here

2093
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,040
okay and

2094
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:53,840
share screen

2095
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,080
okay now i'm gonna show you oops

2096
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,120
it just don't know why i just died maybe

2097
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:21,120
one second here

2098
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,719
let's reduce the bandwidth a little bit

2099
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,840
here

2100
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,840
okay

2101
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,120
okay now

2102
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,719
this is where we have to keep in mind

2103
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,480
that we're seeing signals here

2104
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:10,879
but the signals aren't very strong

2105
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,360
so what we're going to do is i'm going

2106
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,760
to go ahead and put a different antenna

2107
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,480
on here

2108
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,040
which will cause the signal to light up

2109
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,080
because it's the right

2110
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,559
frequency

2111
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,840
okay

2112
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,840
and

2113
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,159
and as we see when that antenna is

2114
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,480
hooked the correct antenna for that band

2115
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,280
is hooked up

2116
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,320
those signals pop right back out

2117
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,040
uh so what we can do here is this fm

2118
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,719
channel that i'm going for

2119
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:04,159
is 103.7

2120
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,799
megahertz

2121
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:14,239
i'm going to increase the gain here

2122
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:26,239
i'm going to zoom in a bit here just

2123
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,000
and as we see we can actually see that

2124
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,960
waveform as

2125
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,600
it's getting

2126
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,320
sorry about the stuttering here on the

2127
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,120
video because uh

2128
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,120
this ends up using a lot of video ram in

2129
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,640
order to produce

2130
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,400
uh but as you see here the waveform you

2131
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,640
can see is back and forth

2132
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,320
so if we rotate it to left and right

2133
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:57,600
it actually is uh adjusting it back and

2134
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,199
you can you can see that popping

2135
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,679
and this would be an fm station

2136
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:12,400
because the carrier is consistent and

2137
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,120
the audio is

2138
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:19,678
yeah yes i can hear let me

2139
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,840
unshare here

2140
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,040
and turn on my video

2141
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,840
so part of it is also i guess to try to

2142
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,640
understand

2143
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,880
you know like if you're especially if

2144
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,480
you're using a

2145
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,199
universal radio hacker or in spectrum

2146
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:38,960
part of it is also guesswork to try to

2147
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,199
figure out what encoding it is

2148
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:43,040
and by looking at it you can sometimes

2149
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,840
recognize what those encodings look like

2150
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,080
um it nothing is perfect in detecting it

2151
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,840
now with here i'm not picking up the

2152
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,000
good bands of there was another signal

2153
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,600
that was going alongside it

2154
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,600
and that looks like a rectangular block

2155
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,800
on each side

2156
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,600
of the primary signal now we couldn't

2157
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,600
see that very cleanly here

2158
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,440
but what that was is that was actually

2159
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,520
what's called hd radio

2160
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,199
and you'll see a lot of those blocks in

2161
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:10,639
the further up the bands if you look

2162
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,960
around 700 megahertz and 800 megahertz

2163
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,280
you'll see just like a lot of blocks and

2164
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,800
it looks like the signal just goes

2165
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,400
up stays there comes back down

2166
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,040
and they're digital signals they're very

2167
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,920
wide

2168
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,320
um and a lot of times they're either

2169
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,280
cell phone

2170
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,199
or their other communication stuff that

2171
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,040
you just don't want to get into

2172
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,199
um you'll also see something very

2173
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:34,159
similar to

2174
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:38,080
uh hdtv uh over-the-air

2175
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,600
they will look very similar as well

2176
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,280
whereas a digital transmissions like

2177
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:41,679
that

2178
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:43,800
that are dense will just look like big

2179
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,080
blocks um

2180
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,440
and of course with those kind of signals

2181
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,760
you need a lot wider uh

2182
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,679
software-defined radio bandwidth in

2183
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,520
order to actually pick them up

2184
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,480
um one earlier tool that i found that

2185
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,920
was able to get that

2186
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,239
uh you had to have a sustained write of

2187
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:01,600
40 megabytes a second

2188
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,520
in order to actually capture the uh data

2189
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,880
stream of a uh

2190
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,520
hdtv so we're not talking about

2191
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,040
insignificant hardware to be able to

2192
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:14,320
decode these things at all

2193
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,719
okay

2194
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:20,239
so interested in decoding digital

2195
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,400
transmissions oh my gosh

2196
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,920
there are so many of them um a tool that

2197
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,239
i

2198
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,000
actually has a website and a tool that i

2199
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,639
use a website is called sigid

2200
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:34,480
sig id wiki so signal identification

2201
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,520
wiki

2202
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,400
and that has a whole bunch of different

2203
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,360
audio

2204
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,080
iq and picture resources to try to

2205
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,120
figure out

2206
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,520
what a signal is and how does it relate

2207
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,520
to what i'm seeing

2208
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,120
because one of the neat things about the

2209
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,560
way these radio waves

2210
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,000
work is everybody lives in their area

2211
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,520
and you're going to see a completely

2212
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,199
different spectrum map of what things

2213
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:58,480
look like compared to

2214
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,120
i'm living here in indiana or if you're

2215
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,800
near a coastline

2216
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,360
uh if you're near an airport um if

2217
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,639
you're in different countries all around

2218
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:08,239
the world you're going to have different

2219
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:09,840
regulatory requirements of what you're

2220
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,440
going to be normally seeing what you

2221
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,320
won't see

2222
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,639
what's allowed what isn't so every

2223
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,560
location is really cool and unique it's

2224
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,120
sort of like

2225
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:20,560
mining for gold for each place

2226
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,400
uh i live about 40 miles away from a

2227
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,159
military installation

2228
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:26,480
so there are some very strange things

2229
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,520
that come out from the

2230
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,520
area over there do i touch it no

2231
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,639
but that's the kind of things that we're

2232
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:35,199
going to see in this kind of stuff

2233
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,520
another thing that i also noticed is

2234
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,239
here in

2235
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,880
the city i live in bloomington indiana

2236
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:41,520
uh

2237
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,760
they're putting in water meters called

2238
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,159
census s-e-n-s-u-s

2239
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:48,400
and these things are they're they

2240
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,600
function on from

2241
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:52,480
902 megahertz to 928 megahertz and

2242
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,239
they're sped spectrum so what they do

2243
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:56,080
they're tiny little chirps

2244
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,840
but those chirps happen across the whole

2245
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,080
section of of bandwidth

2246
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,800
so these water devices are reporting how

2247
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,600
much water

2248
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,800
are is being used every i think five

2249
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,040
minutes

2250
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,480
uh so they have remote water detection

2251
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,679
capability

2252
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,600
uh and they're growing that here in the

2253
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,600
city and they don't want to send

2254
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,520
a person to every house every month to

2255
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,400
be able to see how much water they used

2256
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,120
now the census water meters we don't

2257
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,560
know how to decipher that data

2258
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,080
accurately yet

2259
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,040
so the company knows how to do it um

2260
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,560
it's not been opened up for the rest of

2261
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,520
us yet

2262
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,040
uh now of course we also have to

2263
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,560
consider some of the downsides too of

2264
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,120
doing that

2265
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,880
is you could then spy on other people

2266
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,239
and how much water they're using

2267
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:41,920
now that doesn't sound like much but

2268
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,440
unfortunately

2269
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,040
given privacy we don't want to get into

2270
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,679
the privacy arguments there

2271
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,280
it just you don't want to spy on other

2272
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,960
people

2273
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,639
but at least in the digital transmission

2274
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:54,800
side of thing there are so many

2275
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,639
different digital transmission modes out

2276
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,719
there and you can make new ones up

2277
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:01,520
all the time so we have tens of

2278
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,239
thousands of

2279
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:04,080
of them now there are commonalities

2280
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,840
between a lot of them

2281
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,880
um but it's not a simple

2282
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:12,000
clear-cut here's ten protocols there's

2283
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,280
gonna be reused

2284
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,719
uh new ones are being created all the

2285
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,480
time and especially with

2286
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,840
software-defined radios that are trying

2287
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,600
to be incorporated into consumer

2288
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,679
products

2289
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,760
the nickname that they have been given

2290
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:24,719
by the fcc

2291
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:27,679
is cognitive radio and cognitive radio

2292
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,600
is really cool because it's radios that

2293
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,080
are

2294
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,320
that are aware of other radios that can

2295
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,440
adjust

2296
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,639
their communications depending on what's

2297
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,080
around them

2298
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,000
so we we're getting into a lot of

2299
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,520
effectively if you want to use a catch

2300
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,159
phrase

2301
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:45,839
a machine learning of radios

2302
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,639
so digital transmissions are only

2303
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,159
increasing in complexity

2304
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:51,600
and there's tons of things going on

2305
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,600
there um

2306
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,840
but like i said if you check out sigid

2307
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,120
wiki

2308
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,800
and then there's an accompanying program

2309
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,480
that one of the people made there called

2310
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,600
artemis and that is effectively a sigid

2311
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,320
wiki

2312
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,280
in a program that you can download and

2313
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,480
run on your machine

2314
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,239
it doesn't do any sort of real-time

2315
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:12,239
analytics you have to still manually

2316
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:13,440
match things

2317
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,000
uh but it can at least narrow it down to

2318
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:16,639
i'm

2319
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:19,199
i'm in this frequency to this frequency

2320
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:19,679
it's

2321
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:22,480
this the signal is this wide it looks

2322
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,440
like this

2323
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,840
and artemis and seged wiki can help you

2324
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,280
figure out what that signal

2325
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,840
might be

2326
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,000
okay

2327
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,920
okay well what length of wire should i

2328
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,800
put on pin four of the raspberry pi

2329
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,840
okay so here's what i actually did i

2330
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,639
didn't put a

2331
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:54,159
wire on it

2332
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:56,719
what i did

2333
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,600
i put a pigtail on it so

2334
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,800
this right here is a this is a ufl

2335
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,800
it's a really tiny connector that's

2336
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,040
actually coax connector

2337
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,120
and what i did was i just cut one of

2338
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,520
these i then there is an inner connector

2339
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,360
and then there is the outer shield

2340
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,120
and i attached the inner connector to

2341
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,360
pin four and then the outer shield

2342
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,239
to the ground now what you also want to

2343
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:22,639
do

2344
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:24,880
is put a filter on it i recommend

2345
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,400
putting the filter right here

2346
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:30,719
on the sma jack which is this

2347
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,360
jack right here uh put the filter there

2348
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,320
and you should be good

2349
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,840
in terms of not doing bad stuff

2350
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,600
but that's how i handled that so it was

2351
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,360
just pin four to the center

2352
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,880
and the shield is the ground

2353
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,840
okay

2354
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,400
what are typical sources of these

2355
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,560
signals uh understand airplanes boats

2356
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,360
etc

2357
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,360
but what else might be very commonly

2358
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,520
that i'm unaware

2359
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,560
oh my gosh okay so giving

2360
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,000
other examples of where you can see

2361
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,679
these kind of signals obviously

2362
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,360
there's emergency communications of all

2363
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,280
sorts i mentioned

2364
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,520
a little bit earlier about water meters

2365
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,400
and the municipal water system

2366
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,080
now the other part of that is they also

2367
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,080
have the water pumping stations hooked

2368
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,239
up to the similar systems as well

2369
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:24,000
now this is where you can get into some

2370
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,320
severe trouble don't play with those

2371
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,000
because now you're getting into a

2372
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,600
federal innocent crime

2373
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,280
uh but that's examples of what they're

2374
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,880
using there

2375
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,920
unfortunately uh there was cases

2376
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,239
in i believe dayton ohio and austin

2377
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:39,360
texas

2378
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,440
where somebody was doing some not so

2379
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,480
nice things about recording the signals

2380
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:47,040
for uh controlling the monthly siren

2381
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,719
tests for tornadoes

2382
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:51,840
and they cause them to go off uh so

2383
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,840
the the key behind that is some of the

2384
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,440
older systems for

2385
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,480
uh emerging emergency sirens

2386
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,639
are also vulnerable now i'm not going to

2387
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:01,520
discuss how to

2388
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,080
actually do that attack uh i've worked

2389
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,360
with the emergency communications

2390
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,239
director here

2391
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,400
in my county to actually verify that we

2392
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,320
aren't subject to that attack

2393
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,880
uh but nevertheless there are some

2394
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,639
localities that are

2395
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:17,840
um another thing to think of with radio

2396
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:22,239
is who here has a car

2397
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:24,880
if do you have a remote open and could

2398
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,840
you lock and unlock your car remotely

2399
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,920
that's also using radio as well

2400
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,920
so we also have to consider that and

2401
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,360
unfortunately there are stomachs

2402
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,719
there are some things that you can do to

2403
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:36,560
that which aren't good

2404
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,840
um but nevertheless those you also use

2405
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,000
radio um

2406
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
another really cool thing is weather

2407
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,840
radar radio stations or

2408
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,719
so if you have any weather radios and

2409
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:50,000
you listen to the weather radio we can

2410
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,280
actually tune into those channels

2411
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,480
directly

2412
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,000
those are just another audio channel as

2413
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,480
well and a lot also

2414
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,320
another area where we see these kind of

2415
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,520
radio communications

2416
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,400
is um you can buy for like twenty

2417
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,239
dollars twenty five dollars you have a

2418
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,360
us

2419
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:09,280
um and you can buy these uh like they do

2420
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,320
like the wind

2421
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,280
temperature humidity and they just

2422
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,719
report back simple data

2423
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:17,760
about uh the locality you're in

2424
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,280
and those are actually under a frequency

2425
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,159
called 433 megahertz

2426
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:24,800
which is also a very simple data

2427
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,400
protocol that you can listen to

2428
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,400
and actually pull that real-time weather

2429
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,440
data from

2430
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:33,199
wherever the sensor is put and have that

2431
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,040
uh pulled into your computer for

2432
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,120
whatever purposes you need

2433
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,800
and that's what if you want to do

2434
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,719
interactive real time whether

2435
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:43,679
grabbing from your house you can do that

2436
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,199
or if somebody else happens to have one

2437
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:45,760
around

2438
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,480
nearby it'll just grab and say it'll

2439
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,880
tell you what temperature it is

2440
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,400
so that's a really cool device your

2441
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,840
purpose is for that for being able to

2442
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:54,639
get easy

2443
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:58,480
uh acquisition of local weather

2444
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,480
um obviously there's communications of

2445
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,520
all sorts

2446
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,600
uh there's just there's so much things

2447
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,280
anything that communicates without a

2448
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,440
wire between the two

2449
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,840
uses radio uh and if i remember

2450
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,600
correctly i think today on hacker

2451
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,080
on hackaday there was an article about

2452
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,480
that even adjusting the ethernet

2453
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:19,679
sampling rate so you can go from like 10

2454
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:21,440
megahertz or 10 megabit or

2455
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,120
10 megabits a second to 100 megabits to

2456
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,840
a gigabit and by changing the sample

2457
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,440
rates back and forth you can actually

2458
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,080
do morris code when it flips and that

2459
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,080
was reported i think around noon today

2460
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,520
on hackaday

2461
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,840
so and that's getting into a different

2462
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,440
area called tempest

2463
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,360
which is there's a lot of things that

2464
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,760
are electronic that

2465
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,159
unintentionally emit radio

2466
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:46,480
that we didn't really think of and

2467
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,320
that's when they're using

2468
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,400
those things to be able to transmit that

2469
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,760
things that you wouldn't think that an

2470
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,760
ethernet cable could transmit

2471
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,639
but it does um so tempest is a really

2472
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,080
cool area

2473
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,800
uh it's known more for the spy side of

2474
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,360
things

2475
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,760
of where you can like technically watch

2476
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,520
somebody else's computer monitor from

2477
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:06,800
remote

2478
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:10,400
um like through 20 feet 20 feet 30 feet

2479
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,920
or so

2480
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,080
but that's the unintended that's why the

2481
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,280
fcc was created

2482
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,199
is because they're trying to also keep

2483
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:19,440
in mind unintentional

2484
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:23,360
emitters because you you don't want your

2485
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,760
lawn you know your clothes dryer to emit

2486
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,600
radio waves it wasn't supposed to emit

2487
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:28,400
it

2488
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,159
and that's why they exist to certify and

2489
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:31,600
make sure that those things are not only

2490
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,960
safe but also they're not

2491
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,679
doing bad things of the spectrum um and

2492
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:36,400
if we've noticed

2493
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,159
if and if you have software to find

2494
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,760
radios um

2495
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,360
what you'll find is there'll be some

2496
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,800
devices especially

2497
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,080
uh low quality power bricks

2498
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,639
that plug into like questionable laptops

2499
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:49,520
or usb

2500
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,520
chargers or whatever and you plug them

2501
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:54,719
in and you will see all sorts of badness

2502
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:57,520
uh across the spectrum if your if your

2503
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:58,000
rtl

2504
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,239
sdr or a software defined radio is

2505
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:01,360
nearby

2506
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,719
that's because those things don't have

2507
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:04,800
they they are very dirty power they will

2508
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,800
admit like you wouldn't believe

2509
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,280
um i know for a lot of amateur radio

2510
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,800
operators who work in high frequency

2511
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,600
band these devices will just completely

2512
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,719
trash your performance

2513
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:20,000
and just fill it with static and deck so

2514
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,520
you have to be careful especially if

2515
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,440
you're working in the lower frequencies

2516
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,199
about what you're plugging in and what's

2517
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:28,159
on and what's not

2518
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,480
um yep and baby monitors ham relay

2519
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:37,040
stations noisy electronic oscillators

2520
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:41,520
um rfid tracking in stores yeah

2521
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:43,520
uh wasn't that the rds on either side of

2522
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,560
the fm

2523
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,440
uh technically the rdr the rds is the

2524
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,000
single

2525
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,360
line uh since now with

2526
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:54,000
our channel we actually have a solid

2527
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:54,960
band that wasn't

2528
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,639
very evident on the signal that i was

2529
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:58,719
displaying and that was

2530
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:01,199
the and that signal if you can see it is

2531
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:01,760
actually the

2532
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:05,040
hd radio and it's a solid bar so you

2533
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,400
have your peak right here

2534
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,639
and this bar is like right here about a

2535
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:09,840
third of the way up

2536
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,440
and that's the hd radio

2537
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,880
yep

2538
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:22,159
yep citizens banned although i've not

2539
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:24,080
seen much traffic on citizens band

2540
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,920
at least from here in south central

2541
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,600
indiana i don't see much traffic

2542
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:33,120
on that yep sigid wiki is absolutely

2543
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,520
amazing

2544
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,199
yep in the netherlands leonard makes a

2545
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:42,719
great point here says in the netherlands

2546
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:43,920
as far as i know you can listen to

2547
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,360
whatever you can receive

2548
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,600
you can't share what you heard uh so

2549
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:48,960
there are actually

2550
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,719
and this is where every jurisdiction in

2551
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:52,880
every area has its own laws

2552
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,520
so for example here in the united states

2553
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,440
yeah it's actually technically illegal

2554
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:57,760
to

2555
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,159
listen to pager messages that were not

2556
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:01,440
explicitly meant for

2557
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:04,719
you now the way the pager messages work

2558
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,560
is everybody gets shoved into this big

2559
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,679
box messaging box and then your device

2560
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:11,120
only shows you the messages that were

2561
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,120
meant for you so

2562
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:16,800
listening to pagers is

2563
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:20,639
illegal just straight up illegal uh

2564
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:22,159
and it's just not good because there's a

2565
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:23,600
lot of stuff in there that you really

2566
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,880
shouldn't ever know

2567
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,320
uh unfortunately if you do a little bit

2568
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,600
of research there's a lot of people who

2569
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,360
do medical things across pagers that

2570
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:30,719
they should never have

2571
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:33,600
they shouldn't do and just don't go

2572
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,120
there

2573
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,080
but at least at least with listening i

2574
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,040
also know that

2575
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,360
in the united states it's also illegal

2576
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,199
to technically tune into

2577
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:46,880
cell phone bans and those bands are i

2578
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:47,360
believe

2579
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:50,560
in the gosh 700 megahertz and the 1500

2580
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,920
megahertz

2581
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,560
uh but it's actually technically illegal

2582
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,159
to tune into them

2583
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,080
uh is anybody going to catch you if you

2584
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,080
listen if you if you look at the band

2585
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:03,360
no but it's still a good practice to not

2586
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:04,880
do that kind of stuff because if you're

2587
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:05,840
in public

2588
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,760
if you're a defcon or if you're wherever

2589
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,440
you don't know who's watching

2590
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,199
and you don't want to do things that are

2591
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:15,839
going to cause you liabilities

2592
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,480
yup specific being on cell phone self

2593
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,799
yep

2594
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:27,119
yeah yep

2595
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:28,800
yeah utility monitoring via radio has

2596
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,159
been shown to be useful for detecting

2597
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,239
when people are on vacation

2598
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:35,040
uh that's one of the dangers of having

2599
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:36,800
those kind of things available

2600
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,000
is that's one of the things we have to

2601
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,159
keep in mind is if we write decoders to

2602
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:42,480
to read that kind of data we can enable

2603
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,199
some pretty

2604
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:46,639
terrible things and this is the nature

2605
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:48,159
of how technology works

2606
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,520
you know there are always good things

2607
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:50,880
that are opened up but there's also

2608
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:51,520
newer

2609
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:55,040
bad things that are open up as well

2610
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:58,239
now many of our sdrs can receive the

2611
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:00,480
supposedly banned frequencies

2612
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,440
okay so the way the sdrs work uh so i

2613
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,679
actually have amateur radio

2614
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:08,880
handsets and i also have sdrs

2615
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,280
the amateur radio hardware has those

2616
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:12,639
frequency blocks built in

2617
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:14,800
so you can't you can't go to them

2618
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,960
however the software defined radios

2619
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:20,320
don't have any other blocks at all

2620
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,440
and that's just something to keep in

2621
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,920
mind that technically you can do it you

2622
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,480
shouldn't do it

2623
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,480
if you enter the usa it's forbidden to

2624
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,080
bring sdr's

2625
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:39,199
radio devices in uh i honestly i'm not a

2626
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:40,320
lawyer so i can't

2627
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,840
tell you i just try to stay away from

2628
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,159
stuff that's obviously don't do

2629
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:46,480
um

2630
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:52,480
okay some sort of devices like cell

2631
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,679
jammers are illegal

2632
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:56,639
yes uh jammers of pretty much every type

2633
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:58,239
are illegal

2634
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:00,880
um even i if i remember there was a

2635
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,000
hotel chain that

2636
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,280
ended up getting busted because they

2637
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,840
were doing uh the authentication

2638
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:08,480
attacks on uh people all around the

2639
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,920
hotel

2640
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,000
um and that was considered to be a form

2641
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
of jamming and that was deemed illegal

2642
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,360
by the fcc

2643
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,560
uh don't grief people i mean literally i

2644
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,320
said be nice to people uh

2645
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:23,760
because the the rules encoding what nice

2646
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,080
means is actually encoded by the fcc

2647
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,199
if you're griefing somebody you're

2648
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:30,080
probably doing something illegal

2649
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,440
it's not always a one-to-one but they

2650
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,760
i find that the people in the sec do

2651
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,360
assume if you're not

2652
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,440
being a bad actor they're not going to

2653
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:40,960
treat you like one but if you show that

2654
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,080
you are

2655
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:44,080
they come down on you like a hammer um

2656
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,840
because there was a person who was doing

2657
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:46,480
some

2658
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:49,199
arduino work a while back up in michigan

2659
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:49,920
and

2660
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,159
what they did was they used a cheap

2661
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:54,320
little 433 megahertz

2662
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,560
radio communications to talk to their

2663
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,320
garage door

2664
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,719
and uh determine if the garage door was

2665
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:02,159
open or closed or not

2666
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:04,080
the problem was is this thing was

2667
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,920
transmitting 100

2668
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:09,520
power whenever it was off so it was the

2669
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,480
it was the inverse logic so when it was

2670
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,000
when the door was closed it was doing

2671
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:14,560
100

2672
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,639
power when it was open it was doing zero

2673
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,320
percent power

2674
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,520
and this was this um this

2675
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,600
signal was actually interfering not only

2676
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:27,440
100 43 megahertz but also 315 megahertz

2677
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:30,560
which is what a lot of car key fobs are

2678
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,320
and it was literally jamming everybody

2679
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,159
out from being able to open their car

2680
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:34,800
within a

2681
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,679
two or three mile radius and the fcc

2682
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:38,080
finally

2683
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,639
zeroed in on this person and they

2684
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:41,600
literally it was

2685
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,520
an arduino project nothing nothing

2686
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:45,040
malicious nothing bad

2687
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:47,520
but it was a really bad unintentional

2688
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,639
radiator

2689
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:50,239
and they went and they actually fixed it

2690
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:51,840
and they didn't find anybody they didn't

2691
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,360
they just they they confiscated

2692
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,400
the part like the 75 cent part from the

2693
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,800
cheap chinese websites they confiscated

2694
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,679
that part

2695
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:01,040
but there was no fines they didn't do

2696
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,440
anything bad to them

2697
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,679
another case where i know with the ftc

2698
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:06,880
they did

2699
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,560
come in and they confiscated everything

2700
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,840
electronic including the tv and the

2701
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:12,239
microwave

2702
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:15,280
so the ftc will most of what i found

2703
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:18,960
they are very good but they will come

2704
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,600
down on you hard if you're bad

2705
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,159
so that the whole thing about jammers if

2706
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:25,840
you're doing jammers

2707
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:29,040
they don't assume good so don't run

2708
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,440
jammers

2709
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:35,760
okay yeah i was actually

2710
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,520
i saw that steve asked about what about

2711
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,159
tire pressure sensors on cars

2712
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:43,360
unfortunately yes they do talk on a

2713
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:44,400
radio frequency

2714
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,280
uh the problem is there are some cars

2715
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:47,760
that

2716
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,639
you can attack and it's a very bad

2717
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:52,560
attack and there's no way to fix it

2718
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,239
so i didn't really want to get in too

2719
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:55,920
much of that realm

2720
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,199
uh only because people who have uh

2721
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:01,360
luxury cars are subject to some really

2722
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,800
nasty stuff

2723
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,320
and until they get that kind of thing

2724
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,000
fixed uh

2725
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,080
i was trying to keep that nice and quiet

2726
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,440
you can implement the replaying of the

2727
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,520
car stuff some pretty cheap radios yeah

2728
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:22,560
yes you can

2729
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,400
again this is some more exploit level

2730
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,159
stuff which don't think it's really

2731
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:29,119
appropriate here

2732
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:33,440
um i've read about using software to

2733
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:35,040
find radio to analyze harmonics to

2734
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,560
determine the point of failure was on a

2735
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,239
solar panel okay i've not actually heard

2736
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:40,159
of that one that's the new one for me

2737
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:44,080
uh i do know let me pull it out here

2738
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,800
um so i actually have and if you ever

2739
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:47,600
get into

2740
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,800
uh antenna design of all things um

2741
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:55,360
this is a nano vna saav2

2742
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,119
this is an antenna analyzer and you can

2743
01:40:57,119 --> 01:40:58,800
actually hook this up to a cable

2744
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,880
and you can determine where the cables

2745
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,639
fault is

2746
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:05,360
real time so i don't know if that's

2747
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,480
related to the same thing you're talking

2748
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:07,840
about with the software defined radio to

2749
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,199
analyze harmonics

2750
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:10,960
but that sounds awesome and i want to

2751
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,760
know more about that

2752
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,760
uh heck of the article where iphones

2753
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,320
leak audio into the am spectrum uh yes

2754
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:19,360
and so do intel

2755
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:22,239
and so do amd cpus uh you can put an am

2756
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:23,040
radio next to

2757
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:24,719
any cpu and there is something called

2758
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:26,639
system bus radio

2759
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:29,679
uh that will real time play an mp3

2760
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:32,639
of your choice out over am radio over a

2761
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,239
cpu

2762
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:36,159
uh and that's a perfect example of

2763
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:38,239
tempest as well

2764
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:39,920
i just a little bit earlier about

2765
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:47,840
unintentional radio emissions

2766
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:00,560
yep i can get to a little bit of the new

2767
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,400
radio stuff let me go ahead and hop over

2768
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,719
here

2769
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,840
okay

2770
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,840
okay

2771
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,718
okay

2772
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:57,840
let me go ahead and share my screen

2773
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:04,159
and

2774
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,000
this is actually one program that i've

2775
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:08,960
been playing with

2776
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:12,159
and this is actually a uh oops taking a

2777
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:15,199
minute to load up here

2778
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:18,559
let me get out of this one

2779
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:25,119
okay so this is a uh

2780
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:29,040
a new radio flow uh that is trying to do

2781
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:31,920
a tempest detection of my monitor next

2782
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:32,560
to me

2783
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,920
so i have two laptops with me and

2784
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,679
what i was trying to do earlier i don't

2785
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:38,880
know if i can get this to display

2786
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:39,840
correctly

2787
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,880
um is this is doing a tempest quote

2788
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,639
unquote an attack

2789
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:48,159
to try to pick up the lcd screens

2790
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:50,639
radio emissions to see in black and

2791
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:52,000
white what's

2792
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,440
on that machine now i have to be fairly

2793
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:56,639
close to this because this is not

2794
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:58,400
something you can do far away at a real

2795
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,080
far distance

2796
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,760
there's rumors and things that say that

2797
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,600
you can

2798
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,199
i've never found them to be very good

2799
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:08,480
because the signal is so weak

2800
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:11,199
so we can open up each of these blocks

2801
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:12,639
so let's go over a little bit of what

2802
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:14,000
these blocks are so

2803
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,639
all these that's a variable they have an

2804
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:17,199
id

2805
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:20,560
and the name and then the value

2806
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,840
and as you can see the value can

2807
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,280
actually be a variable as well

2808
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:30,000
so all these variables come together

2809
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:32,719
so we have all these variables here

2810
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:34,320
these down here they have arrays right

2811
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:34,960
here

2812
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,040
and these arrays by the way are monitor

2813
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,960
resolutions

2814
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:42,000
now that's why those numbers are 640 720

2815
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,159
640 uh those kind of things

2816
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:48,560
um you can set a gui range

2817
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,440
so this allows you to create menus this

2818
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,199
is a counter and a slider

2819
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:56,080
um as you can see we have a few of the

2820
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:56,400
cute

2821
01:44:56,400 --> 01:45:01,280
gui ranges here uh and we have the

2822
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:05,280
h display which is the h size

2823
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,199
this allows you to control what module

2824
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:08,960
it's coming from

2825
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,800
so if we look here this is a kind of a

2826
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:12,159
long thing but this is actually pulling

2827
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:14,800
from a blade rf

2828
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,040
uh so this is this this this is kind of

2829
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:18,000
a

2830
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,600
voodoo kind of going on here with the

2831
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,760
device to arguments

2832
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,920
uh because you have to know the exact

2833
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,679
long string that you need to feed this

2834
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:26,880
thing to keep it happy

2835
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,480
uh this can be a little painful but once

2836
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:29,920
you have it recorded down and figured

2837
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:30,880
out

2838
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,080
it it'll just work um

2839
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:35,679
where would we go to figure that out

2840
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:36,880
because that's where i'm having a hard

2841
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:37,679
time

2842
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:40,960
really okay um let me show you another

2843
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:41,840
way of how i

2844
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,760
figure it out it helps all right uh

2845
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:44,880
there's so there's a question to get

2846
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,320
into january radio stuff so please

2847
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:47,679
continue but i would like to circle back

2848
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:48,800
to that at some point

2849
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,239
oh absolutely um

2850
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:56,880
oops lots that's new

2851
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:00,560
oops uh but what i use

2852
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,360
is yeah actually if you use i i i can

2853
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,159
show you the command

2854
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:06,239
it's an osmocom command that'll report

2855
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:08,239
back to you all of the devices that are

2856
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:09,040
available

2857
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:12,320
for a software defined radio i also find

2858
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:15,360
gqrx to automatically find

2859
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,080
and gqrx will also help you tell what

2860
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,679
stream you need

2861
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:23,040
uh both will do so and that's once you

2862
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:23,920
have that because

2863
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,760
gqrx is actually pretty good for

2864
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,520
automation

2865
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,920
for automatically determining that and

2866
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,360
then once you do that you just copy

2867
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,719
paste into that line and just

2868
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:36,480
don't touch it then from here

2869
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,320
what what makes it this can be fairly

2870
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,400
difficult exactly what's going on

2871
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:44,719
um so we have each of these is a plug-in

2872
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,560
think of it as a function like

2873
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:47,840
if you remember back in like middle

2874
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,440
school or high school where you have a

2875
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,639
black box

2876
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:54,239
a number like one goes in and out comes

2877
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:55,360
two

2878
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:58,159
um and that function is adding plus one

2879
01:46:58,159 --> 01:46:59,040
to everything

2880
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,960
each of these functions does its own

2881
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:02,239
thing

2882
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:04,080
uh now the other thing to keep in mind

2883
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,360
here and like i said the

2884
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:08,560
uh the folks who create the hack rf

2885
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,320
have like a 10 hour video series that

2886
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:13,119
covers all this and they do exceptional

2887
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:14,880
uh but effectively what you have to do

2888
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,800
is match the color to the color

2889
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,960
this is the how this is the type of data

2890
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,159
that's being

2891
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:24,320
emitted and received

2892
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,239
and some of these things like this

2893
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:28,000
converts data from a complex to a

2894
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:28,960
magnitude

2895
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:32,639
this changes it to a blue to a orange

2896
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:35,119
and then float to char if you're

2897
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:36,159
familiar with more programming

2898
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:38,480
terminology uh photochar you're going

2899
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,320
from one data type to a completely

2900
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:41,760
different data type

2901
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,760
and then sdl sync this actually tries to

2902
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,360
do the video sync

2903
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,520
um like i said i've been playing around

2904
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:49,600
with this trying to get this to work

2905
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,199
but this is kind of the complications

2906
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:53,040
that you'll see with some of these

2907
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:58,320
tools and it'll look kind of sprawling

2908
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:05,840
now uh let's see here

2909
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,480
and i believe i have gqrx on here as

2910
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:19,840
well

2911
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,839
it will complain most likely

2912
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:32,800
yeah okay gqrx has a tendency

2913
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,000
that if there's no software to find

2914
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,239
radios on the system it will complain

2915
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:38,080
and uh throw an error let me go ahead

2916
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:40,880
and try plugging one in

2917
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:44,080
this by the way is the

2918
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:47,600
blade rf a4 or blade blade rf 2.0

2919
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:50,800
a4 now if you notice here there's four

2920
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,639
of these boards sticking out extra

2921
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:55,600
outside of that um these are two of them

2922
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,000
are

2923
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,480
low noise amplifiers for the receivers

2924
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,320
and the other two are power amplifiers

2925
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,440
for the transmit

2926
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:08,880
now

2927
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:14,960
and uh josh uh you don't need to

2928
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:15,840
interrupt but

2929
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:18,080
uh we'll be closing the stream soon so

2930
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:19,679
if you just want to wrap up some

2931
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:22,960
uh last minute questions or something

2932
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:25,840
uh go for it absolutely let me get back

2933
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:29,840
here and

2934
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:33,519
okay

2935
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:36,880
do you have a current example of the

2936
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,599
simple fm receiver

2937
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:41,920
the fm receiver that will depend on

2938
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:44,159
either on hardware because i do have

2939
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:47,360
that and i also do have the software to

2940
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:49,280
find radio version of that

2941
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:50,960
i could whip one up fairly quickly i can

2942
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,440
show you the problem is you'll find the

2943
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,960
reason why a lot of the examples won't

2944
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:56,000
work is because you have

2945
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,360
to adjust it to the appropriate sdr

2946
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,760
hardware you have that's a lot of the

2947
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,199
problem with gui radio is

2948
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:04,480
it doesn't have automatic hardware

2949
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:06,320
detection

2950
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,880
the lna mpa it's actually the official

2951
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:09,679
ones from

2952
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:12,880
new and as well so it's the

2953
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:16,880
ones that work for the blade rf 2.0 a4

2954
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:21,840
um i just i bought all of it as one shot

2955
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:25,119
okay how to build yep

2956
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:26,960
uh there are changes in modules and gnu

2957
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:29,599
radios yeah the 3.7 to 3.8

2958
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:31,760
upgrade added a lot of new things but

2959
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,199
the problem is that it also

2960
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:35,679
disenfranchised all of the 3.7 and older

2961
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:37,040
code

2962
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,239
so a lot of times you have to go back in

2963
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:40,560
there and recompile it or if the modules

2964
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,080
just don't exist you have to find out

2965
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:44,639
comparable ways to do that module

2966
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:48,239
um but if you're making just a simple

2967
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:51,520
narrow fm or a wideband fm receiver

2968
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,199
it shouldn't you shouldn't need anything

2969
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:56,879
special or anything out of the ordinary

2970
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,639
uh changes in the up

2971
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:06,000
yeah and that's exactly it is is it's

2972
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,520
the virgin mismatch that we're having

2973
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,560
problems with

2974
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:11,520
uh they decided at that point to make a

2975
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:11,920
hard

2976
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:15,199
abi cut over which like i said got

2977
01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:17,679
it it it's cleaning up things a lot but

2978
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:19,520
it also removed a lot of the older stuff

2979
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,599
from being able to be usable

2980
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:24,560
um i actually stuck with 3.7 myself

2981
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:25,840
because i have a few modules that were

2982
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,599
made a few years ago that haven't been

2983
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:28,480
touched

2984
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:30,560
and i haven't had time to actually go in
