2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,320
i

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,320
thought i would start with a silly and

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,759
slightly fun little slide

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,200
this is one of my very very first

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,599
projects out of college about 25 years

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,640
ago

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,680
which was a

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,920
doll as you can see here with a 4-bit

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,119
microcontroller

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,160
programmed an assembly that for a

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,519
biomedical engineer was

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,560
was quite a project quite a lift

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,840
it had a little

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
switch mechanism in the hand and the

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,399
switch mechanism was built on some legos

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,520
where i drilled out

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
the the studs and used that as a

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,680
three-bit binary encoding system that

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,559
would allow me

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,200
to detect different types of

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,079
accoutrements

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,079
that were put in the doll's hand and the

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,280
doll would respond to

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,640
the different things with different

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
actions so here's a rattle

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,000
when you put the rattle in the hand the

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,520
doll would shake the rattle

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,879
and would make some sounds if you put a

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,559
teddy bear in the hand the doll would

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,240
take the teddy bear up to its mouth give

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,080
it a kiss and make some

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,640
other sounds if you put a pacifier in

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,280
the hand

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,040
uh it could detect the pacifier and then

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,640
put the pacifier in his mouth

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,320
so this was an interesting exercise for

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,960
me because

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,560
it represented uh engineering meets

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
humans um in a strange way

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,080
after four years of undergraduate and

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,040
then some

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,520
time in graduate school i realized that

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,119
i'd been working

45
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,119
kind of in a physics vacuum and that

46
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,479
physics vacuum

47
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,439
was really looking at

48
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,560
how to implement different kinds of

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,680
physical systems

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,040
how to build various technologies and

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,960
this was the first time that i'd really

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
put the pieces together

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,399
with the fact that everything i build is

54
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,280
going to impact

55
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
a human being in some way and in

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,040
the sense of being a biomedical engineer

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,040
it was kind of a shock to me that

58
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,920
after five years of school i hadn't

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,880
really thought about

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,200
the human that i was engineering for and

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,080
it really took

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,520
this job where i became a toy inventor

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,560
for a few years

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
to look and say wow i'm going to

65
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,480
engineer things that have an impact on

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,440
people's lives

67
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,080
and in this case a very small impact

68
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,480
it's

69
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,760
it's a toy but when i took a step back

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,599
and thought about the broader

71
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,239
scope of the toy work that i was doing

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:28,640
uh

73
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,920
there's a lot of stuff that we were

74
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,080
creating that would end up in landfills

75
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,760
we were working as toy inventors where

76
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,440
we were licensing ideas

77
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,800
the things that we would create would

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,280
typically be played with a kid for

79
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,720
a couple days a couple weeks before they

80
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,120
got bored and then the kid would want

81
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,319
the next thing and

82
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,560
that was almost a design decision

83
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,120
because if you think about what these

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,160
toy companies were

85
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,040
after they're not trying to get kids to

86
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,239
be creative and use their own

87
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,440
imagination

88
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,760
and play with something for years on end

89
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,120
they're trying to get something

90
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,800
that a kid's gonna look at and say i

91
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,239
really really really

92
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,000
want that and get their parents to buy

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,440
it and

94
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,720
after some period of time we

95
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,319
would see the toy companies wanting the

96
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,760
kids to buy the next thing because that

97
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,400
generates

98
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,080
revenue for them so this put a lot of

99
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,000
things in perspective for me despite the

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
form factor of the project

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,760
um and how kind of weirdly disturbing it

102
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,959
is

103
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,400
it really brought engineering into a

104
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,840
context that i hadn't been exposed to

105
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,519
before and and that's a little bit

106
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,480
of what i want to talk about today and

107
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,000
uh my slides are a little bit scattered

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,879
so excuse

109
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,440
that i got distracted by the events of

110
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,879
the last week

111
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,239
um so

112
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,480
the first thing i want to mention is

113
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,840
that

114
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,680
um technology is not neutral

115
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,879
and let me just

116
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,720
see i need to pull up my

117
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,400
notes here so um

118
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,680
the the i want to bring up

119
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,480
melvin cranberg's uh cransberg's laws of

120
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,599
technology

121
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,080
and focus on a couple of them technology

122
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,599
is neither good nor bad

123
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,560
nor is it neutral invention is the

124
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,040
mother of necessity

125
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,759
not necessity is the mother of invention

126
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,520
technology comes in packages big and

127
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,120
small

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,880
although technology might be a prime

129
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,320
element in many public issues

130
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,680
non-technical factors take

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
precedence in technology policy

132
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,199
decisions

133
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,800
all history is relevant but the history

134
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,479
of technology is the most relevant and

135
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,759
technology is a very human

136
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,560
activity so is the history of technology

137
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,600
so

138
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,120
these are some pretty important comments

139
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,560
um you might agree or disagree with

140
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,120
with uh melvin kransberg i happen to

141
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,400
agree with them

142
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,600
but i think i want to um

143
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,199
highlight a couple issues uh and

144
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,600
and ideas related to this

145
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,039
um what fundamentally separates us from

146
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,720
other animals is that our intelligence

147
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,639
allows us not just to reshape our

148
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,600
landscape like

149
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,639
ants making it anthill but also

150
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,360
we can fundamentally understand

151
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
[Music]

152
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,360
how nature works and use that

153
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,639
understanding of nature to change the

154
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,320
world around us we can overcome our

155
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,880
natural

156
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,039
and physical limitations through

157
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,199
technology and engineering

158
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,400
what that comes down to is that

159
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,320
human beings have very special powers

160
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
and to me those special powers are

161
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,600
manifest through

162
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,720
um engineers and how we

163
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,080
as technologists make choices about the

164
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
things that we make

165
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
um one of the things that that i think

166
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,000
is an important observation about this

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,960
is that uh we as human beings augment

168
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,759
ourselves

169
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,280
and our environment and those

170
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
augmentations become part of

171
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,840
humans as a species uh our technology

172
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,800
evolves as we do

173
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,479
and it evolves us this is an idea

174
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,120
that i'm sure other people have had but

175
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,639
something i've been thinking about a lot

176
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,840
that i have been pushing on which is the

177
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
idea that

178
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,160
technology is part of human evolution

179
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,639
and the things that we create and the

180
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,960
augmentations

181
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,840
that we build around us are things that

182
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,319
are

183
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,240
passed down not as part of our physical

184
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,479
dna but they're sort of extra corporeal

185
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,280
dna

186
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,560
what i mean by that is that for example

187
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,919
if it's hot out over centuries

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,199
we might expect to see adaptations

189
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,479
for human beings physically where

190
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,599
we sweat more effectively where as we

191
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,319
breathe

192
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,319
we exchange more heat through the air in

193
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,360
our lungs

194
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
and we become better adapted to survive

195
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,039
in

196
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,039
in these high temperature environments

197
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,199
so that's

198
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,240
biological adaptation uh in

199
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,039
its classic sense but humans have this

200
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,720
very interesting and very new form

201
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,560
of adaptation which is technological

202
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,280
adaptation in those same environments

203
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,400
instead of having our dna

204
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,560
be nudged in one direction through

205
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,759
selective

206
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,680
processes we can actually

207
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,120
understand nature understand that we can

208
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,800
cool ourselves actively in these

209
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,400
environments by applying energy in a

210
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,520
certain way

211
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,800
and we document that information

212
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,919
in the form of patents in the more

213
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,280
recently in open source and wikipedia

214
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,319
articles

215
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,120
um instructions on how to build things

216
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,919
and

217
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,680
that's something that never goes away

218
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,520
you can't take that away from us that's

219
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,759
passed down from from person to person

220
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,520
from generation generation

221
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,960
in this this larger

222
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,160
uh schema of knowledge and information

223
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,599
that's carried forward

224
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,120
and that larger schema is

225
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,879
what i call this external dna the

226
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,479
extractorial dna

227
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,759
because it's instructions for how we can

228
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,080
build

229
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,599
augmentations to to uh

230
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,840
the human organism an augmentation that

231
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,599
makes us be able to

232
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,840
for example teleconference over the

233
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
internet

234
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,080
or keep ourselves warm keep ourselves

235
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,280
cool

236
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,000
defeat a virus our own immune system

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,880
might not have

238
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,279
the right signals say to defeat

239
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,559
coronavirus

240
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,120
but we can do a ton of research build

241
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,000
that information

242
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,159
into into vaccines into treatments

243
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,839
and then that knowledge is passed on

244
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,440
from generation generation

245
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,680
so we've effectively evolved the

246
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,200
organism

247
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
on a time scale that is unprecedented

248
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,240
compared to

249
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,160
biological time skills another important

250
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,580
factor about this is that

251
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,240
[Music]

252
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
good ideas reproduce and they're passed

253
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,399
on hopefully bad ideas die off

254
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,560
we also have to think about what it

255
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,160
looks like when

256
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,480
those ideas meet the broader forces in

257
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
society

258
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,440
and to expand on this idea that

259
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,320
technology cannot be neutral i am

260
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,920
quoting a research article from

261
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,480
lance strait in a technology journal

262
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,720
who said that taking a media ecology

263
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
approach technology cannot be neutral

264
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,399
because it is a form of change

265
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,560
it has an inherent bias based on the

266
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,800
properties of its materials and methods

267
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,640
additionally the application of

268
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,720
technology is an intrinsic part of

269
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,920
technology itself

270
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,120
as is technique instruction software

271
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,519
or know-how moreover the bias of

272
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,279
technology cannot be reduced to the

273
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,399
designer's intent

274
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,880
as innovations always have unanticipated

275
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,519
unwanted

276
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,560
and undesirable effects i think these

277
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,040
words

278
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,040
are um profound and it really captures

279
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
what i'm talking about today this this

280
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,160
idea

281
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,800
that we sit i'm in my basement right now

282
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,079
my uh inspection scope

283
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,240
my oscilloscope my lathe uh

284
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
i've got let's see which way do i slide

285
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,680
here

286
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,120
um some cnc circuit board

287
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,240
making materials right behind me um

288
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,720
in my garage that's over that way i've

289
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,519
got a

290
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,480
brazing rig that i can use to make air

291
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,720
conditioners heat pumps things like that

292
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,800
so i'm fairly well equipped to be able

293
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,839
to make

294
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,000
things that hopefully and potentially

295
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,560
have impact on people's lives

296
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,319
which i'll get into a little bit

297
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,760
encapsulating that power and

298
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
understanding that power i think is

299
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,079
something

300
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,120
that cannot be ignored and um and should

301
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,279
not be ignored and all too often

302
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,760
we as engineers and designers we want to

303
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,920
ignore it we want to think about

304
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,200
not the impact that we might have on

305
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,320
society

306
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
but we want to think about the thing

307
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,680
that we're building and

308
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,160
there's nothing wrong with that i think

309
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,800
that that's

310
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,079
that's why we do the work that we do

311
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,600
i also think that it is important to put

312
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,040
this work into this broader context so

313
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
i'm going to transition a little bit and

314
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,200
kind of go through

315
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,240
some of the story here and maybe without

316
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,000
uh transitioning back and forth to

317
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,480
slides

318
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,880
2020 is an extraordinary year

319
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,320
i don't think it's uh an overstatement

320
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,680
to say that

321
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,480
um i do want to reflect on some of the

322
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,279
positive

323
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,800
technological achievements that have

324
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,639
happened in 2020

325
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,399
uh i i'm blown away by the fact that we

326
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,279
have the osiris-rex probe i know that

327
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,720
these first two things are gonna

328
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,839
um focus on space but

329
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,680
we sent a probe into outer space

330
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,639
landed it basically for a moment on an

331
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,519
asteroid

332
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,440
collected a large amount of sample

333
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,639
material

334
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,760
um somewhat securely put it back into a

335
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
sample storage container and are flying

336
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,920
that back to earth

337
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,680
that's super cool the amount of

338
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,320
of amazing achievement that went into

339
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,920
making that possible

340
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,120
um can't be understated i mean just

341
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,519
trying to land this thing on a rocky

342
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,959
body that

343
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,480
couldn't be inspected you know we

344
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,800
couldn't look like we did with moon

345
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,000
and say where are the craters where are

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,079
the flat spots where are the things that

347
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,720
that we need to watch out for we haven't

348
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,079
sent multiple probes

349
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,200
to um to bennu

350
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,360
to see where the optimal landing spots

351
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,600
were all of that was figured out

352
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,720
using some grainy images launching a

353
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,279
rocket

354
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,120
with enough smarts to be able to get

355
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
there safely

356
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,399
do its job and then come back that's um

357
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,920
can't be understated we've also launched

358
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,120
people in space

359
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,399
safely on a new rocket and i think um

360
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,480
that's another achievement that that

361
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
can't or shouldn't be

362
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
um ignored um

363
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
going back to the other items on my list

364
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,680
that i do have some slides for

365
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,040
um

366
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,600
let's see so i started the year by going

367
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,000
to

368
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,040
ces and at ces there's a lot of

369
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,440
excitement about

370
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,800
blockchain technologies a lot of

371
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,440
excitement about internet of things

372
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,079
as always is the case a lot of

373
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,320
excitement about energy technologies

374
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
5g was all the rage television screens

375
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,440
that were the size of uh the wall on a

376
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,040
medium-sized house

377
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,920
things that just represent the the

378
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,959
amazing power

379
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,880
of uh of engineering and science

380
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,279
to make just hard to imagine things

381
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,199
even five years ago um the the power of

382
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,040
artificial intelligence and machine

383
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,880
learning and the applications

384
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,199
that are working you know we we look at

385
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,160
things like

386
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,920
self-driving cars being um

387
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,360
being hard but uh

388
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,600
and say oh maybe we quite haven't quite

389
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,480
gotten there with

390
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,279
uh some of the technology that is

391
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,800
underlying artificial intelligence and

392
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,920
machine learning

393
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
but at the same time there are some

394
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
massive wins with machine learning uh i

395
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,480
was talking with

396
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,519
one of the heads of the deepmind project

397
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,320
at google

398
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,680
who was saying that they ran their tools

399
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,160
on

400
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,199
a server farm and

401
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,040
were able to optimize a control system

402
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,519
that had

403
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,920
millions of variables in it and through

404
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,000
that machine learning optimization

405
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
they were able to get a 40 savings in in

406
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,760
energy consumption

407
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,360
um and they published a great article on

408
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,000
it that that sort of work

409
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,199
um where we're getting massive wins

410
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,720
through computation

411
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,639
through better approaches to problem

412
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,880
solving uh technical problem solving

413
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,199
um those are things that we we have to

414
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,639
celebrate and we have to

415
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,560
respect uh the advances that we're

416
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,839
getting there

417
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,680
um there's also been a lot of hyped tech

418
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,279
when i say 5g there's

419
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,920
both the opportunity and also the the

420
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,160
reality

421
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,199
but all of that said i think we also

422
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,959
have to recognize that it has been a

423
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,240
bizarre

424
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,440
a sad and a momentous year right after

425
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,480
going to ces

426
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,240
the next conference and last conference

427
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,800
i went to this year was one called ahr

428
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,320
the um largest it's the

429
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
heating refrigeration air conditioning

430
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,440
trade show

431
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,720
largest in the world um 100 000 plus

432
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,759
people

433
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,000
probably another hot spot for spreading

434
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,800
uh

435
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,000
pandemic but

436
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,600
one of the observations that i always

437
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,040
make there is that

438
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,639
there's a lot of really old technology

439
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,720
that uses tremendous amounts of energy

440
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,560
that sees very very little innovation

441
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
and um

442
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,680
it's not an exciting field to work and

443
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,000
i've talked about it at hackaday before

444
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,399
but it's one that has massive amounts of

445
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,040
importance

446
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,959
to to the world so um

447
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,920
that transitioned me from from all of

448
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,680
the hype and excitement of ces to the

449
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,880
reality of

450
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,519
wow you know there's a lot of work to do

451
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,800
to make

452
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,079
the world the place that we want to live

453
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,880
in and then leaving

454
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,160
ahr and uh facing

455
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,320
the full brunt of of a global pandemic

456
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,970
um we're seeing over

457
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,040
[Music]

458
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,720
hundred thousand people getting infected

459
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,400
per day in the us

460
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,919
um hundreds of thousands of people in

461
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,000
the us have died

462
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,119
we can't underestimate the

463
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,439
power of these things to drive change in

464
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,559
society

465
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,599
um from bad change like

466
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,400
uh people repudiating science because it

467
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,280
interferes with

468
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,000
their desires for freedom to good change

469
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,720
things like

470
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,360
the open source uh personal protective

471
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,480
equipment projects

472
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,880
and people coming together to help

473
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,000
healthcare workers

474
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,559
work in better safer environments we

475
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,679
look at

476
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,559
the black lives matter protests this

477
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,120
year

478
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,720
and rhode island just voted finally in

479
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,480
2020 to remove the word

480
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,120
plantations from the state name you know

481
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,160
these throwbacks

482
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,559
to a day where slavery was the norm

483
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,200
and it's 2020 when we're looking and

484
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,320
saying maybe this isn't

485
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,919
the thing that we want to reflect in our

486
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,360
society

487
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,400
i i think understanding

488
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,760
today that the world um

489
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,440
is in an interesting place you might

490
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,360
call it turmoil you might call it more

491
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,840
of the same

492
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,559
whatever your stance on things

493
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,799
it's maybe most important to recognize

494
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,840
that

495
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,280
technology changes things um and

496
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,080
there are a lot of simultaneous

497
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,200
existential threats

498
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,320
to civil society that we see today um

499
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,160
there's climate change there's global

500
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,559
pandemic rising authoritarianism there's

501
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,480
a lot of financial equality

502
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,679
some of you might be nodding your heads

503
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,039
in agreement with me and some of you

504
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:39,600
might be

505
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,679
saying what the heck is he talking about

506
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,440
um and you know what i

507
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,320
get that i respect that because i

508
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,200
understand that

509
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,679
we're not all impacted by the same

510
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,440
things in the same way we might see

511
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,400
these challenges

512
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,480
in a different context we might not see

513
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,440
these challenges at all

514
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,360
and if you don't see these challenges or

515
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,400
you see them in a different light it

516
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,080
might be easy then to think that

517
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,919
they're not problems they're not global

518
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,440
challenges but

519
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,600
the thing that i urge you to do is

520
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,720
remember

521
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,799
that just because things are going well

522
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,960
for you are going well for us

523
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,880
and the system is working for you or is

524
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,559
working for us there are a lot of people

525
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,520
out there for whom

526
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,760
things aren't going well and for whom

527
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,679
the system is not working

528
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,720
and i also respect the fact uh

529
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,320
and i think that this is the right thing

530
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,240
that there are no laws saying that we

531
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,360
have to work towards

532
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,280
a better world and there probably

533
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,640
shouldn't be laws

534
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,080
forcing people to work towards a better

535
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,919
world because we don't know what the

536
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,760
better world is we can only look back

537
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,960
and say

538
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,200
that things got better for us or they

539
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,640
didn't

540
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,280
and and i take us back to the words of

541
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,640
lance strait which is

542
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,400
that technology is a form of change so

543
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,559
what does it mean to look into the

544
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,520
future

545
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,320
and understand the world that we want um

546
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,600
and try to get there

547
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,320
with technology i think i tend to be a

548
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,840
techno optimist that

549
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,919
technology can cure all these problems

550
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,760
um and i see the sticking point as

551
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
politics and i don't see that say that

552
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,159
in

553
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,960
the way that politics is is wrong or bad

554
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,919
i say that

555
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,120
in the the light that politics

556
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,440
is part of society it's a part of the

557
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,320
decision-making process in society

558
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,520
one of my classmates in college said

559
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,880
i don't believe in politics i don't

560
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,159
think that politics should ever be part

561
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,000
of engineering and i've heard lots of

562
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,919
engineer colleagues say that like i i

563
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,000
don't want to deal with politics i

564
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,919
i don't think that politics should

565
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,240
inform what i do as an engineer

566
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,760
um i i

567
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,240
it's always interesting for me to hear

568
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,080
people say that because

569
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,440
if especially the friend who is a civil

570
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,360
engineer who said that to me and

571
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,360
um i think that the the

572
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,000
the insight here is that like i said

573
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,120
politics is really

574
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,520
the decision-making process of a society

575
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,799
in a lot of ways

576
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,400
um and one example of of how that

577
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,039
impacts

578
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,000
technology i i think we all can reflect

579
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,640
on

580
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,760
this very moment imagine a world where

581
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,559
every eligible voter in the united

582
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,320
states could vote digitally

583
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,400
and that that vote could be registered

584
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,559
instantaneously so instead of waiting a

585
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,080
week for the results of an election

586
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,880
we can know within a matter of minutes

587
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,080
or hours

588
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,679
without people having to go to polling

589
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,200
booths without anyone ever having to

590
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
leave their house

591
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,559
um what would that world look like there

592
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,760
are a lot of questions that we'd have to

593
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,320
ask there

594
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,480
how do you maintain privacy how do we

595
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,400
ensure that every registered voter has

596
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,240
access to a voting portal whether it be

597
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,640
a computer a phone or voting booth

598
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,679
how do you properly adapt vet identities

599
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,960
to make sure that there is no voter

600
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,320
fraud

601
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
how's the integrity of the data

602
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,000
maintained from end to end

603
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,280
how do we make sure that there's no

604
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,360
hacking

605
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,440
i would argue and lots of people have

606
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880
argued this that we've solved these

607
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,400
problems technically

608
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,520
we have blockchain we have

609
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,200
the means for biometric identification

610
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
all of these questions have a technical

611
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,600
solution

612
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,440
but we have not merged those solutions

613
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
with the political will and political

614
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,760
motivation to implement those solutions

615
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,039
there is a decision process that

616
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,200
has looked at this body of technology

617
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,799
that people like us have created

618
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,039
and said that's not what we want to do

619
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,120
today that's not what our society wants

620
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,280
to move forward with for whatever reason

621
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,880
i won't get into the reasons there's

622
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
lots of theory about um

623
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,840
why some people don't want more people

624
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,400
to vote

625
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
or have access to voting and why some

626
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,600
people do

627
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,480
but what i will reflect on is that um

628
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,960
after the 2016 election hacking scandals

629
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,039
a lot of jurisdictions actually went

630
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,640
back to paper voting

631
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,360
so that they would literally have a

632
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,640
paper trail

633
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,360
for the votes that people made instead

634
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,039
of

635
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,280
digital where they thought you know

636
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,880
those digits could just evaporate like

637
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,760
what happens if the bits get flipped

638
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
cosmic rays hit it or somebody hacks the

639
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,880
box

640
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,480
if we have paper russian hackers

641
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,760
can't access that paper so that was the

642
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,720
thinking

643
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,919
that paper brings confidence all the

644
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,840
newfangled fancy technology that us

645
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,600
technologists make

646
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,280
that's all great i don't understand how

647
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,240
it works i understand how paper works

648
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,799
i can touch paper i can feel it it is

649
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,080
tangible to me

650
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,360
um i call this the first of fourth

651
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,039
bridge effect and if you look up the

652
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,880
history of the fourth first of fourth

653
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,760
bridge

654
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,840
um it was built after the tay bridge

655
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,039
disaster

656
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,960
and one of the design criteria was that

657
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,480
the design of this bridge must instill

658
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,640
confidence in the structural integrity

659
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,080
of the bridge

660
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,440
this was not an engineering edict it was

661
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,840
not

662
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,750
that you have to maintain a certain uh

663
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,240
[Music]

664
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
load profile across the members of the

665
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,320
bridge or the structure of the bridge

666
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,240
it was not that we want to optimize for

667
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,520
certain

668
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,400
material strength and cost it was that

669
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,679
there must be public confidence

670
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,200
when they look at the bridge they say

671
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,720
that looks like something that i want to

672
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,919
cross

673
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,240
so there's this profound interaction

674
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,679
between the engineering and

675
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,039
the the um

676
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,159
the societal impact

677
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,360
another thought and observation about

678
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,320
this politics engineering intersection

679
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,120
is

680
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,440
the story of the light bulb and not the

681
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,600
edison swan light bulb um hopefully you

682
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,440
all know who joseph swann was

683
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
um but thinking more about the modern

684
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,559
light bulb

685
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,000
in 2011 um

686
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,120
going back to my slides here

687
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,480
uh in 2011 and 2012

688
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,159
there was uh a law

689
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,600
passed that was going to phase out the

690
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
incandescent light bulb by

691
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,039
2012 and that law was

692
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,679
was actually pushed by george w bush

693
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,960
trying to make

694
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,320
uh efficiency the norm but it also had

695
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,880
an interesting underpinning which was

696
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,240
that american

697
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,799
american innovation and american

698
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,840
industry

699
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,919
in 2010 2011 2012 had been

700
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,360
pushing white leds which came out of a

701
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,440
lot of research in

702
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,720
universities in the u.s and in japan and

703
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,840
u.s companies were taking the lead on

704
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,559
manufacturing high efficiency white

705
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,600
light bulbs

706
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,159
but there was a pushback in congress

707
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:54,960
that said

708
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,000
we're gonna undo this this

709
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,600
ban which is driving uh people forward

710
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,559
to using

711
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,279
white leds and driving these industries

712
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,159
in the u.s

713
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,960
um we're gonna undo that ban and you

714
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,799
know the markets will decide what will

715
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,840
win

716
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,279
um that was great unless you were

717
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,559
a u.s manufacturer of white led light

718
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,679
bulbs where

719
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,080
those regulations were opening up a new

720
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
market

721
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,360
unfortunately china said hey

722
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,600
that was a smart idea we think that

723
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,640
there's going to be a shift

724
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,840
we're going to drive this market in

725
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,960
in china and support companies to

726
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,000
basically take

727
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,120
the innovations from the us researchers

728
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,520
we're going to commercialize them and

729
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,159
now

730
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,880
all the light bulbs in my house are leds

731
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,840
white leds

732
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,600
that are manufactured in china so

733
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,320
there's a missed opportunity there

734
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,640
if you think about the decisions the

735
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,919
political decisions that

736
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,120
the american political infrastructure

737
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,159
made with the longer term

738
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,880
implications being that there's there's

739
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,640
a market opportunity that shifted from

740
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,279
the us

741
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,360
to uh china so um

742
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,679
that also there's a conversation i had

743
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,120
with a senior

744
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,520
uh executive at one large hvac companies

745
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,440
who said the only thing that pushes my

746
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,080
industry

747
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,120
is regulation which becomes a really

748
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,080
interesting

749
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,279
challenge because we have

750
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,960
lots of opportunities to create new

751
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,039
markets new technologies that

752
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,000
work in those markets but the gap

753
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
between

754
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,840
implementing those um i i can't tell you

755
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,279
who said that because it was said

756
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,440
in confidence in a private conversation

757
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,600
but um i will tell you as a senior

758
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,320
executive

759
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,559
at um one of the largest uh global

760
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,559
manufacturers of hvac equipment you

761
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,679
could probably guess

762
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,600
which one of the three it is but like i

763
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,960
said i

764
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,240
won't out this person publicly

765
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,360
but the the um

766
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,480
the implication is that that

767
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,240
in some senses market forces work and in

768
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,159
some senses market forces

769
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,520
interact with technology and they

770
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,200
interact with with

771
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,919
um the politics and the political will

772
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,760
and the political direction

773
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,559
of of governments and i think we all

774
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,919
need to take a step back

775
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,679
and understand that i

776
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,000
want to quickly um since i'm running out

777
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,679
of time and i would love to talk for

778
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,679
another two hours about this um

779
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,960
i want to quickly reflect on on a couple

780
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,039
takeaways and then some projects

781
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,720
so for me the message here is

782
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,279
that we have to as engineers designers

783
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,720
technologists hackers makers

784
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,640
we have to put our work in context

785
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,120
it's important to focus on your work

786
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,640
when you're doing it and think about the

787
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,559
beauty of technology and the beauty of

788
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,520
science and the beauty of engineering

789
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,159
it's also important to understand that

790
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,799
broader context and to think about

791
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,799
how we want our technology to be used in

792
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,000
the world what do we want that

793
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,760
impact to be what do we want the world

794
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,440
to look like

795
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,000
five years from now when we bring our

796
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,600
work to life

797
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,640
for me i spend a lot of time in my

798
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,559
garage brazing

799
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,440
if you search for the tested video i did

800
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,840
with adam savage this is a really fun

801
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,919
project uh where i was working on a

802
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,120
wearable air conditioner

803
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,360
for him he's a fantastic guy he's a

804
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,880
great person to work with

805
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,120
um good friend and it was a lot of fun

806
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,640
it also is part of work that i do

807
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,720
looking at how we use less energy to

808
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,559
make people comfortable

809
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,240
with heating cooling which is one of the

810
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,919
the biggest consumers of

811
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,520
energy and one of the biggest producers

812
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,279
of

813
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,960
climate change emissions and

814
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,799
another project i did with some

815
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,159
colleagues at princeton university

816
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,880
called coldtube where we're looking at

817
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,520
how do you cool people in environments

818
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,120
that are hot and humid and do that with

819
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,399
less energy

820
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,720
um the team at the chaos lab force

821
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,360
meagers

822
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,840
uh eric title bomb and uh some

823
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,799
collaborators

824
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,320
uh adam rysanic and um others

825
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,840
were super creative we we made something

826
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,159
that could cool below the dew point

827
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,600
without creating dew and humidity and

828
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,480
condensation

829
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,360
uh sorry humidity is there but without

830
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,080
condensing

831
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,640
the humidity in the air and um and

832
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,120
that's

833
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,640
an interesting problem to overcome when

834
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,159
you're trying to cool people in

835
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,120
singapore

836
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,279
and use less energy another great

837
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,320
project

838
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,360
for you to look up is the elm elm the

839
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,200
ecological living module that i worked

840
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,039
on with colleagues at yale university

841
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,559
the yale school of architecture

842
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,399
in collaboration with the united nations

843
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,480
that's looking at the future of disaster

844
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,600
relief housing

845
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,200
and the future of refugee housing how

846
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
that can be made sustainably

847
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,960
in large volume large scale

848
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,880
those are a couple cool projects and i

849
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,720
really should close with this question

850
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,340
of

851
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,039
[Music]

852
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,000
how does your work impact the world and

853
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,159
what do you want that impact to be

854
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,240
and be thoughtful about that we as

855
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,600
engineers are told that we have to take

856
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,679
ethics classes i think that's a failure

857
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,000
of

858
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,159
engineering education we should all be

859
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,440
ethical humans we should all be

860
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,159
humanists

861
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,000
because engineering is human um

862
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,919
i know i'm running out of time so i just

863
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,120
want to very quickly

864
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,799
give a few shout outs

865
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,120
first of all to all of you for being

866
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,159
here thank you

867
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,600
thank you for putting up with some of

868
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,919
the technical difficulties

869
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,760
sorry my slides are great but you didn't

870
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,960
get to see them

871
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,039
maybe another day thank you to the

872
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,080
hackaday team

873
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,880
sophie christina mike everyone who's

874
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,360
helped

875
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,399
put this together and bring this

876
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,120
community together um

877
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,360
i should definitely give a shout out to

878
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,640
some organizations that i'm involved

879
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,279
with who are

880
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,039
i think doing really powerful things in

881
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,200
the world uh doing great things in

882
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,760
in the us to support engineers and

883
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,480
makers

884
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
and to try to make the world a better

885
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,640
place the maker education initiative

886
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,640
um nation of makers the beagleboard

887
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,000
foundation

888
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
um kyle kornforth at maker education

889
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,039
initiative is

890
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,519
amazing dorothy jones davis nation to

891
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,159
makers

892
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,080
uh jason kreidner who many of you know

893
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,440
at beagleboard foundation the rest of

894
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,799
the board directors

895
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,080
um and you know i will say that there's

896
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,840
a lot of parts of government that are

897
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,519
working really really well with

898
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,760
engineers and

899
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,039
um to try to unlock the potential of of

900
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,799
human beings and uh in california

901
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,480
the california energy commission is a

902
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,399
surprisingly innovative

903
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,159
and thoughtful and forward-thinking um a

904
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,159
branch of california government as is

905
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,320
the california strategic growth council

906
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,360
they fund a lot of projects um trying to

907
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,679
basically make people's lives better um

908
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,360
but doing it in a way that supports

909
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,480
industry and supports um

910
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,559
commercial efforts the us department of

911
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,039
energy national science foundation

912
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,880
hackaday obviously is a fantastic

913
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,559
organization and the open source

914
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,760
hardware association

915
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,960
is dear to my heart as well

916
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,399
so with that uh i'll leave you with one

917
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,760
thought don't build bridges in the

918
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,440
middle of the ocean

919
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,399
technology in and of itself is great but

920
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,200
um

921
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,360
the bridge has to connect two pieces of

922
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,440
land to be useful to humans

923
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,360
and if it's not useful to humans it

924
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,039
doesn't matter so don't build your

925
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,159
bridges in the middle of the ocean put

926
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,640
them in places that make a difference

927
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,360
remember that technology extends the dna

928
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,559
of humans

929
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,799
some of that can cause cancer some of

930
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,320
that can cure cancer

931
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,039
we want technology to extend dna in ways

932
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:55,600
that

933
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,200
cure cancer and to close with

934
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,600
uh the title of a book from henry

935
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,559
petrovsky

936
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,679
to engineer is human so think about

937
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,800
the human impacts of engineering

938
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,918
um i'll leave it there and

939
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,440
uh hopefully me ranting from my basement

940
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,079
somewhere

941
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,719
in new england was was interesting to

942
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,839
all of you thank you

943
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,800
all right that was that was awesome

944
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,760
thank you kip

945
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,599
um it's also really nice to see you

946
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,760
again and you know now we're in our

947
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,800
shops which is

948
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,280
also kind of different and cool i think

949
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
the last time i saw you was in january

950
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,679
when we were still allowed out

951
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,119
yes i i'd love to give you a tour of my

952
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:43,599
shop

953
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,719
um but then you'd kind of see my laundry

954
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,480
room and um

955
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,800
you know lots of lots of cool circuit

956
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,960
boards down here that i can show off

957
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,000
um i've got my surface mount equipment

958
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,560
next to me like i said my mechanical

959
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,200
equipment

960
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,320
is here there's um

961
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,480
when when you're in the northeast you

962
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,079
know states like rhode island

963
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,440
real estate's a little bit cheaper than

964
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,599
say in san francisco so it's

965
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,960
a good place to be yeah yeah especially

966
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,119
especially if you're doing stuff that is

967
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,720
mechanical and requires a lot of big

968
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,240
tools

969
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,440
yeah having a garage where i can braise

970
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,000
stuff and build heat pumps um the

971
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,359
largest heat pump i've built is

972
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,680
about the size of a small refrigerator

973
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,839
the smallest heat pump i built

974
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,640
was one that fits in a wearable air

975
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,960
conditioner for a backpack for nasa

976
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,240
the one that i built for adam savage is

977
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,000
a little bit bigger than the

978
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,119
the nasa simulation

979
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,680
heat pump but having a little bit of

980
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,800
space can help

981
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,079
if i was doing electronics it wouldn't

982
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,400
matter

983
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,920
so we're gonna do a quick q a and i took

984
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,520
a few questions from

985
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,720
um from our from our chat um we've also

986
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,560
got a fair amount of compliments over on

987
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,920
youtube don't go there yet let's let's

988
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,000
just let's do a couple questions

989
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,040
let's do the questions okay so

990
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,560
uh well let's i'll do a an easy one have

991
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,560
you read any good books lately

992
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,200
what do you

993
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,680
uh you know unfortunately i've

994
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,960
um i haven't really read

995
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,760
much this year that's not been research

996
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,480
papers

997
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,440
thermodynamic textbooks uh power

998
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,119
electronics textbooks

999
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,240
so i've really been heads down in in

1000
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,640
research and startup land

1001
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,079
uh trying to do a lot of thermal

1002
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,599
optimization so if you have

1003
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,200
recommendations

1004
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,280
last time i hung out with mike we

1005
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,119
exchanged podcasts i've been listening a

1006
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,040
lot of podcasts a lot of radio

1007
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,920
um a lot of new music but i i'm looking

1008
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,200
forward to taking a little bit of

1009
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,520
uh rest from work and and reading i've

1010
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,880
been working like

1011
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,920
you know 60 78 hour weeks for the last

1012
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,640
couple years

1013
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,800
not totally great but riding a bicycle a

1014
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,680
lot

1015
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,599
i know i was i was gonna say that since

1016
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,040
you're in rhode island

1017
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,359
you you have room for brazing equipment

1018
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,640
and bicycles

1019
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,320
and electronics and heat pumps and yeah

1020
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,400
and laundry all in the same space yeah

1021
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,359
um and

1022
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,000

1034
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,000
in november that's just today climate

1035
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,880
change

1036
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,359
right um i have two more questions for

1037
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,320
you and then

1038
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,280
um we'll say goodbye and people you'll

1039
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,079
give us

1040
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,119
a way to contact you yes yeah make sure

1041
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,480
you don't forget to do that

1042
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,440
so our next question is from anil patnik

1043
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,480
and he asks

1044
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,200
what can the current political system

1045
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,280
and voting processes learn from open

1046
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,839
source culture

1047
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,400
ah that's a great question um

1048
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,680
i i hate to say it but i have to turn

1049
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,520
that question on its head which is what

1050
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:15,839
can

1051
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,520
open source culture learn from political

1052
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,000
processes and and the reason i do that

1053
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,200
is that i think the

1054
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,520
sticking point here is really not the

1055
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,200
open source community and it's really

1056
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,520
not

1057
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,680
the

1058
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,680
technology i i think the technology is

1059
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,359
there the technology exists

1060
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,560
the question to me really is why

1061
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,800
is it that we have these great

1062
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,200
technologies that don't get implemented

1063
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,880
um what's keeping

1064
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,480
the the solutions that we know

1065
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,240
exists and that we know work what's

1066
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,520
keeping those solutions

1067
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,040
from being put out in the world and and

1068
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,440
some of that really is when

1069
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,320
you listen to the news um the real news

1070
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:00,800
and

1071
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,640
the so-called fake news um there's

1072
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,480
there's just a lot of history and a lot

1073
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,440
of of uh

1074
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,839
lack of desire in in some ways

1075
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,800
for um enfranchisement i mean you look

1076
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,240
at the history of the us

1077
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,440
and women having the vote is

1078
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,240
not a historical thing um

1079
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,160
ex-slaves african-americans having

1080
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,839
voting rights you know these are new

1081
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:30,960
things

1082
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,520
uh relatively speaking and i think that

1083
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,960
that's something that we have to take a

1084
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,800
look at and say

1085
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,960
you know maybe it's not in everybody's

1086
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,000
best interest

1087
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,520
politically for every single eligible

1088
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,160
citizen

1089
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,560
in america to have access to the vote

1090
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,359
and

1091
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,640
um that's the thing to me that has to be

1092
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,520
overcome

1093
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,960
in order for those technologies to

1094
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,880
become desirable

1095
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,720
by the people who have the power to

1096
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,480
implement them and

1097
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,119
that's really the the work that

1098
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,560
engineers have to do is to

1099
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,880
step back and say i've made this thing

1100
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,680
that

1101
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,800
could have an impact on society what's

1102
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,480
preventing that impact from

1103
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,520
from being realized and how do i

1104
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,560
then go and work to advocate

1105
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,599
to uh to move these things forward you

1106
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,960
know what are the pathways what are the

1107
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,839
venues

1108
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,040
um that's that's unfortunately really

1109
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,640
the second job that we all have

1110
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,319
uh we have to advocate for the things

1111
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,079
that we do we have to educate people

1112
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,520
for them to under to help them

1113
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,680
understand uh

1114
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,119
what the benefits are to them to society

1115
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,880
in general and and some people

1116
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,160
for some people it might not be

1117
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,319
beneficial for everyone to have the vote

1118
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,359
um i during a the clinton

1119
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,480
election i saw firsthand um

1120
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,400
one of the companies that was the major

1121
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,240
contributor to both the democratic

1122
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,800
and elector and republican camp

1123
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,720
presidential campaigns

1124
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,440
hosting politicians in the carnegie deli

1125
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,480
in new york city

1126
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,079
where anyone could walk in and just get

1127
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,720
whatever they wanted for free for a week

1128
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,920
and they were whining and dining

1129
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,560
politicians because they wanted to make

1130
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,200
sure that

1131
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,240
their uh their voice was heard more than

1132
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,359
other people's voices

1133
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,640
and that's the reality of of our open

1134
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,160
democratic society

1135
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,920
um we have to recognize that reality and

1136
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,680
understand how that plays out

1137
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,720
and how that might be threatened by

1138
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,520
you know individuals being able to vote

1139
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,960
very very easily

1140
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
so those are the sorts of things where

1141
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,079
where yeah

1142
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,560
um looking at the impact of the

1143
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,839
technology on politics

1144
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,960
the impact of politics on technology why

1145
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,280
successful technologies don't get

1146
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,160
implemented or

1147
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,640
or uh functional technologies don't get

1148
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,599
implemented

1149
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,720
and what those barriers are

1150
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,000
awesome so you actually just answered

1151
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,319
somebody else's question in in that

1152
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,040
whole thing

1153
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,800
can you tell our audience how they can

1154
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,319
get in touch with you

1155
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,880
and yes say goodbye and i would

1156
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,079
encourage you to go

1157
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,480
to the youtube channel and maybe if you

1158
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,760
want to look in the chat there's a lot

1159
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,640
of really

1160
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,240
nice uh words for you

1161
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,800
i um i've been uh totally

1162
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,599
silent on uh social media for the past

1163
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:20,960
few months

1164
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,800
as i've been navigating trying to keep a

1165
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,040
startup healthy and keep

1166
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,680
a toddler healthy and keep myself

1167
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,440
healthy

1168
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,000
but i'm gonna use this as the catalyst

1169
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,079
to be more active on twitter so

1170
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,119

responsive

1175
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,480
it's probably the best way and maybe i

1176

should also be on i'm on instagram also

1177

vocal in public

1180
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,520
um i'm also going to be hosting a panel

1181
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,800
or a panelist

1182
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,240

1188
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,480
sophie we can talk more about setting

1189
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,040
that up

1190
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,240
and um because that's probably the best

1191
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,520
way because

1192
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,920
it's uh everyone in the same room and

1193
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,040
just having a conversation

1194
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,119
those are great things i would love to

1195
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,800
be there in person and and meet people

1196
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,720
and get to interact but um

1197
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,480
twitter right now is probably the best

1198
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,240
way

1199
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,240
yeah we would uh we would love to have

1200
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,760
you come and do

1201
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,480
an office hours talk to us about energy

1202
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,079
thermodynamics all

1203
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,280
all that kind of stuff that you've been

1204
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,880
working on for as long as i've known you

1205
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,680
yeah i um i also you know a lot of

1206
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,800
people

1207
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
have said thermodynamics was the thing

1208
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,640
that they hated in in college

1209
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,079
and as engineers and i

1210
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,920
love thermodynamics but i hated like my

1211
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,280
class

1212
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,560
it's really taken 25 years for me

1213
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,319
to get to a point where i feel like i

1214
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,000
have a deep understanding

1215
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,920
at least of the thermal systems that i

1216
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,359
work on um

1217
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,760
a deep understanding meaning that i

1218
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,560
understand the things that i don't know

1219
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,160
and where to look up answers and who to

1220
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,000
talk to um

1221
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,920
but it's it's super exciting subject for

1222
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,119
me because it's where

1223
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,040
electrical engineering mechanical

1224
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,680
engineering materials science

1225
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,880
um and in terms of like air conditioning

1226
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,560
biological systems

1227
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,319
all of the fields of engineering to me

1228
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,400
come together in thermodynamics so it's

1229
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,319
been just a super

1230
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,280
uh i hate to say the word super cool

1231
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,880
area to work in

1232
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,880
uh and i'm excited to talk about it and

1233
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,520
answer questions about how these things

1234
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,960
work

1235
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,560
and why you should use vapor compression

1236
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,400
instead of

1237
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,240
thermoelectrics for most of your things

1238
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:52,880
except for the things that

1239
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,920
thermoelectrics work better at

1240
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,000
well thanks thanks so thank you for

1241
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,200
being with us

1242
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,400
um i i want to use that word

1243
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,840
that you are super cool ken

1244
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,640
[Laughter]

1245
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,079
um thank you all again thank you sophie

1246
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,359
uh thank you christina and mike and um

1247
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,839
thank you everyone for for joining in

1248
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,160
and uh bearing with

1249
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,839
all the slides that i didn't get to show

1250
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,400
so appreciate it and

1251
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,760
enjoy the conference and look forward to

1252
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:33,839
meeting you all in person one day
