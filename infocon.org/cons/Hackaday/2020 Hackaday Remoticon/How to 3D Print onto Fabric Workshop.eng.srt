having me

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,320
um before i jump in too much further i

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,199
would like to do

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,800
an acknowledgment of country which is a

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,039
little ritual we do here in australia

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,760
um and as part of it here today i'd like

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,359
to pay my respects to the traditional

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,479
owners of the land from which i'm

18
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,360
joining you

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,200
and that's the terrible people and

20
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,559
acknowledge that not only are we

21
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,520
learning here today

22
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,680
but that this area of land has been used

23
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,520
as a place for exchanging knowledge

24
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,160
since basically the dawn of humanity and

25
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,440
i would also like to pay my respects to

26
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
the traditional owners of all the lands

27
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,879
from which my meeting here today

28
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,800
and pay my respects to their elders and

29
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,920
wise peoples past present and emerging

30
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,120
and that's just a little ritual we do

31
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,039
here in australia whenever we meet as a

32
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,800
group of people

33
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,719
um cool so yes um as kerry very kindly

34
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,159
said i'm billy um

35
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,799
and i used to help run the 3d printing

36
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,720
subreddit and i helped run the 3d

37
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,159
reading discord and i just started a

38
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,119
youtube channel

39
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,760
which i'm very excited about um but yeah

40
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,840
i make posters like these how to level

41
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,560
posters

42
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,640
um and i'm really interested in really

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,280
weird techniques that kind of combine

44
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,520
different areas of interest in the world

45
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,119
of 3d printing with the world of 3d

46
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,640
printing rather so i have like some

47
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,320
embroidered keycaps for mechanical

48
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,280
keyboards and

49
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,360
i just worked out a tool path pattern so

50
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,280
i can create interesting little shapes

51
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,759
that

52
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,439
um yeah were inspired by some

53
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,119
woodworking that um

54
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,119
i saw some awesome japanese woodworking

55
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,880
so um

56
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,240
someone's saying noble mechanical

57
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,600
keyboards oh yeah

58
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,280
uh yes so we've been talking a little

59
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,960
bit um as people have been trickling in

60
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,560
about why we signed up today and it

61
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,479
looks like all of you guys have amazing

62
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,000
ideas all of you people rather

63
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
sorry i'm trying to correct my language

64
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,079
all of you wonderful people have awesome

65
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,079
ideas so hopefully we'll talk through

66
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,600
some of those ideas and hopefully i'll

67
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,119
um present you some you haven't yet

68
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,079
thought of

69
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,960
um and hopefully you will end up with a

70
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,080
little 3d printed

71
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,639
thing at the end of this session so i'm

72
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,840
going to be running this

73
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,599
a little bit topsy-turvy we're going to

74
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,760
get our prints started first up

75
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,520
and as that's going we're going to talk

76
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
about some concepts and considerations

77
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,680
and just some inspiring cool things

78
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,520
um to kind of get get your creative

79
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,959
juices flowing

80
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,200
um and then hopefully we'll be able to

81
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,319
pull our prints off

82
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,239
talk about post-processing and you'll

83
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,840
actually have a printed thing

84
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,000
at the end of this um so fingers crossed

85
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,040
that will all work

86
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,120
um because i really i really wanted you

87
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
to be able to come away with a physical

88
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,040
object because i think that's quite fun

89
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,160
especially seeing as we're meeting

90
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,680
remotely it's kind of interesting and

91
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,239
cool

92
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,560
3d printing allows us to do that um and

93
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,080
then at the end i will give you some

94
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
resources for the future so if you want

95
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,920
to run through this process yourself

96
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,720
um i have some guides up online so you

97
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,319
don't have to remember everything

98
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,360
right now we we have it available

99
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,280
um yeah so 3d printing onto fabric

100
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,560
it makes these kinds of things so

101
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,040
this is a little necklace i made um and

102
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,879
it is 3d printed onto a very lightweight

103
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,360
fabric so it looks almost transparent

104
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,760
um and it moves around and crumples just

105
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,800
like fabric

106
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
this is kind of kind of the thing we're

107
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
doing today we're doing a slightly

108
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,440
smaller one

109
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
i have made a model up for you which is

110
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,400
this it's a little hexagon pattern which

111
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
zoom doesn't like very much but yeah

112
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,840
just a little a little one just to get

113
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,040
you going because i wanted it to be nice

114
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,560
and quick so that we could actually

115
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,280
complete it by the end of the session um

116
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,799
but the basic

117
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,159
has anyone got any questions before i

118
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,000
run on movie

119
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,560
thank you dory chat looks good

120
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
uh is there a list of what we need to

121
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,480
position yeah sorry um i thought it was

122
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:48,959
in the

123
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,120
um that's okay so what you'll need is a

124
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,280
piece of tulle or organza a lightweight

125
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,000
fabric

126
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,599
um some tape as in like some blue tape

127
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,720
or masking tape

128
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,319
for your 3d printer and some scissors

129
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,480
to cut the fabric i think that should be

130
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,119
it yeah

131
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,040
cool so um the basic process of

132
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
3d printing onto fabric is we print

133
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,798
three layers

134
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,759
and then we pause the print and we put

135
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,639
in some fabric

136
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,160
and we tape it down and make sure it's

137
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,320
not going anywhere and then we continue

138
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,960
the print

139
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,040
right up until it finishes and then we

140
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
can remove it from the bed and we have

141
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
our 3d printed

142
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,040
fabric piece so it's not it's not super

143
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
complicated but there are a couple

144
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,040
little tricks

145
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,720
in the slicer and stuff that can make

146
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,639
this process a little bit easier so

147
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,120
i will talk you through those if you

148
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,639
want to jump on now

149
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,000
um this model is up on my website um and

150
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,199
it's at that little

151
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,520
url so if you're following along jump on

152
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,320
there

153
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,960
and we i will show you what it looks

154
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,639
like so this is the website

155
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,000

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,919
and you'll be able to extract the um

158
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,960

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
and then underneath it also is the slide

171
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,520
deck so if you want to follow along with

172
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,320
us today

173
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,000
you can um yeah i i quite like learning

174
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,840
visually and by reading so if that's

175
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,000
your style as well go for it

176
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,199
it's at that same link which again is

177
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
this

178
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,680
so yeah jump on download the model

179
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,240
and then jump into cura because i will

180
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,720
show you how to slice it in there

181
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,680
how's everyone going

182
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,280
got the model okay

183
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:21,840
got some nods yep yep looking good

184
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,080
oh nina you look like you're already

185
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,199
printing on fabric pro

186
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,120
i think i've seen that project i think

187
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,360
it might be on the slide deck

188
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,400
awesome awesome

189
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,840
cool well um has everyone got cura open

190
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,759
we got the model got kira

191
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,120
yeah we'll see we'll see i can wait a

192
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,599
little longer

193
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,000
no i haven't got your installed i'm

194
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,160
using the creality slicer so we'll go

195
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,880
with that oh

196
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
quality slicer is a version of cura so

197
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,160
you should be all right

198
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
yeah you should be fine unless they've

199
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,199
changed it but i don't think they have

200
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,720
i'm pretty sure they're still using cura

201
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,479
um yeah they just rebranded it so

202
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,160
you should be good um okay so

203
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,199
in cura or creativity slicer

204
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,120
same same we're going to be printing in

205
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,800
pla

206
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,000
and we're going to be setting our layer

207
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,160
height to two millimeters and most of

208
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,800
your side

209
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
slicer settings will be the same except

210
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,880
that you'll want five bottom layers

211
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,520
and then we'll also add the pause so

212
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,280
this is our sort of checklist but i will

213
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,800
show you how to do that

214
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,039
now

215
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,759
so here in keira oh it really is tiny i

216
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,840
tried to make it as big as i could but

217
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,319
that is quite small

218
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,639
i'll talk you through it so in cura

219
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,319
there's this wonderful search bar at the

220
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,440
top here

221
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,720
under print settings which if you don't

222
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,599
have this open you click on this

223
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,680
bit where it says like your layer height

224
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,120
and the infill percentage all that sort

225
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
of stuff it will bring up your print

226
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,919
settings

227
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,400
and if it looks kind of abbreviated like

228
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,960
this

229
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,039
go into custom and that will give you

230
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,960
the full list of all the cura settings

231
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,680
so that you can change anything it's

232
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,319
kind of

233
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,280
yeah overpowered there's a lot of

234
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,360
settings so i like using this search bar

235
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,000
to find any of the settings that i need

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,639
um

237
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,960
because yes it's a very long list so the

238
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,400
first thing we want to change

239
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,520
is layer height

240
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,599
and we want to change that to 0.2

241
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,440
millimeters

242
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,279
just so that this print doesn't take too

243
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,479
long um

244
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,479
and also so that it it's nice and

245
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,240
squishy if we were going up to three it

246
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,599
might start to get a little bit loose

247
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,799
and might not squish through to the

248
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,958
layers so 0.2

249
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,080
is the goa um

250
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,959
ah cool slick 3r sorry um i don't have

251
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,480
the instructions for slick 3r

252
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,800
um but i assume there's a way to add a

253
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,399
pause in slicers so

254
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,720
try try as much as you can to follow

255
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,680
along um we'll see how we go

256
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,040
oh you've only ever used it in repeat

257
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,760
there you go um

258
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,880
it should work with others other

259
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,080
other filaments um i'm using petg

260
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,519
today because it's quite easy and it

261
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,680
prints at a relatively low temperature

262
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
um i'm sorry i'm using pla today because

263
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
it prints at a relatively low

264
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,440
temperature

265
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
ptg is a little higher but you stood

266
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
should still be fine

267
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,160
i think once you start getting into like

268
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,920
abs territory

269
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,760
um i would be a little bit worried about

270
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
some of the fabrics melting on the

271
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,080
nozzle

272
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,560
um but please give it a go and and see

273
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,279
if it works

274
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,720
i just thought i'd go pla because most

275
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
people have it it's pretty easy to print

276
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,839
and all that jazz

277
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,160
cool there you go ah look we're looking

278
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,680
out for each other thank you for helping

279
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,800
each other in the chat

280
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,720
um beautiful so 0.2 millimeter layers

281
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,279
and we want uh

282
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,640
what am i i just want yes

283
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,800
so if you type in bottom um there will

284
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,720
be a setting that is bottom layers

285
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,120
and we want to make that five and that's

286
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,399
purely because

287
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,880
we are 3d printing three layers and then

288
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,480
putting our fabric in and then we're

289
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,839
putting two more layers on top so it

290
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,000
actually sandwiches the fabric in

291
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,079
if we were to leave that as like three

292
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,160
layers which i think is the default

293
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,000
um it would just put the fabric in and

294
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,200
it would only be held

295
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,240
by the edges of our model like as by the

296
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,880
walls

297
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,519
of our 3d print which isn't really as

298
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,240
strong as

299
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,640
properly sandwiched between full layers

300
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,920
so make it five

301
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,079
um so we have three layers our fabric

302
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,519
and then two more layers on top to just

303
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,240
really squish it in there

304
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,600
so bottom layers five

305
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,519
you can print with or without bed heat

306
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,880
it doesn't matter too much

307
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,959
um yeah i've had success both ways so

308
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,320
it doesn't really matter in this

309
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,800
instance

310
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,600
um yeah and just one note when we're

311
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,079
printing

312
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,720
quite small patterns like these um if

313
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
you use concentric infill in the top

314
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,040
layer it can kind of mar the surface

315
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
i have an example of that here just

316
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,079
because the nozzle

317
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,720
um i'm not gonna be able to see it but

318
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,480
just because the nozzle kind of

319
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,839
moves around in tiny little circles it

320
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,120
kind of gets a bit scratchy right in the

321
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,399
middle so you might want to set it to

322
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,160
lines or something instead of concentric

323
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,920
if if you your top pattern um

324
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,160
like fill pattern is concentric you

325
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
might want to change it to lines or

326
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,200
zigzag or

327
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,399
just something else that doesn't keep

328
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,160
the nozzle moving in the same area for a

329
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,640
long time

330
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,600
how's everyone doing anyone got any

331
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,480
questions so far

332
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,560
looking all right i'm getting some nods

333
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,640
cool feel free to interrupt me i know i

334
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240
talk quite quickly um but feel free to

335
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
interrupt and i'll keep trying to look

336
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,560
at the chat so

337
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,880
um yeah please just pull me off if i not

338
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,399
making any sense

339
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,240
um cool so that's the bulk of the

340
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,680
slicing done but we want to add our

341
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,600
pause as well so you can if you're just

342
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,880
like doing a quickie

343
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,240
print it and just hit pause on your

344
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,480
machine um but we can actually pause it

345
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,079
at a very specific time

346
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,440
which um makes it makes it a bit easier

347
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,639
so in cura the way to do that

348
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,880
is i will jump back to my presentation

349
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,600
is to add a post-processing script so i

350
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,680
have a little gif here of it

351
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,920
going through and ticking along um i

352
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,200
will do it i'll demo it and then i'll

353
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
leave this gif running so that you can

354
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,120
do the same thing

355
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,000
so there is i'll switch back to the

356
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,240
actual software here we go

357
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,760
so you can go into

358
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,560
oh my gosh come on prepare

359
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,000
oh my gosh sorry no it's me

360
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,760
go into extensions up in the top oh i'm

361
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,120
a little bit chopped off i'll move this

362
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,920
down a little

363
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,360
okay extensions and then post processing

364
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,279
and then modify g-code

365
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,959
oh yeah you can make the initial layer

366
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,800
height it can kind of be

367
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,079
um whatever you normally use i normally

368
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,680
make it the same as the rest of the

369
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,440
layer heights um though sometimes people

370
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
like setting it smaller so you get a bit

371
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,600
of squish to

372
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,920
adhere to the bed um you should be fine

373
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,839
with whatever you use

374
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,200
um so david is that in the in the

375
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,160
modified g-code

376
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,519
you don't have layers only millimeters

377
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,200
is that with the

378
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,560
post-processing that you're talking

379
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,800
about

380
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,800
i'm not sure okay cool we'll get back to

381
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,399
that one um so yes

382
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,160
we are adding the pause by going

383
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,839
extensions post processing

384
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,920
modify gcode and it will open up a

385
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
little window rather like this

386
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,040
and it will probably be empty so you'll

387
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
want to add a script

388
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,120
and go pause at hide there's a few

389
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,639
different paws at heights

390
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,079
depending on what firmware your machine

391
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,399
is

392
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,079
running and if you're running something

393
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,079
like a creality machine

394
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,920
like ender 3 cr-10 or a prusa

395
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,880
mk3 or mk2 or any of those you're

396
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,399
probably running marlin

397
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,800
so you will probably want this one this

398
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,560
one that just says pause at height

399
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,240
there are other pauses for other

400
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,440
machines that are running reprap

401
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,120
firmware like the duet

402
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,399
um or or other ones so um

403
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,360
yes use the one that works for you but

404
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,120
probably this pause at height one

405
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,600
will be the one because this one is for

406
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,160
marlin

407
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,000
even though it doesn't quite say that

408
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,480
but it is

409
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,959
and in this menu you want to change a

410
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:45,920
couple of things

411
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,519
um the pause height is um

412
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,120
you can enter it in oh sorry yes

413
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
the it'll say pause at height and you

414
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,240
want and they'll

415
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,440
the first the first option will be pause

416
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,920
at

417
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,360
and we'll have a little drop down and we

418
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,440
can change it to height or layer number

419
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,360
and we want to change it to layer number

420
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,800
because we want to change it at layer

421
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,120
three

422
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
so just that first drop down change it

423
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,720
from height to layer number

424
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,920
and then the next field below it is

425
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:26,480
pause layer and change that to three

426
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,600
how's that looking everyone run follow

427
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,680
in

428
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,240
one thing too is you can change so it'll

429
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,600
it'll raise the nozzle a bit

430
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,480
by about three centimeters or so and it

431
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,399
will park it somewhere

432
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,279
and it defaults to this 190 millimeters

433
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:43,839
for me

434
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,079
which actually is further than my bed um

435
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,120
because i'm on a delta

436
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,600
this origin point for a delta is the

437
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,639
very center of the bed

438
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,199
if you're using a like a bedslinger or

439
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,800
any cartesian really it's probably a

440
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,600
corner

441
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,880
um so but so 190 millimeters

442
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,800
is usually fine on those machines but

443
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,360
for mine that goes way off the

444
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,759
off the bed so i'm gonna change this to

445
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,639
zero so it

446
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,480
literally just raises up and just hovers

447
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,759
in the middle of my bed

448
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,040
um but just check that that 190 mils

449
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,920
isn't

450
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,240
bigger than your bed is big so you might

451
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,079
want to change it just to zero zero

452
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,440
um but yeah it's just basically going to

453
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,720
raise the nozzle and put it somewhere

454
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,079
so just check that one because i've been

455
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,759
caught out before and then my printer

456
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,440
makes a horrible grading noise

457
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,199
and i'm like yeah and turn it off and

458
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,959
you know you've wasted a little bit of

459
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,160
filament

460
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,519
so yes change those parks park values to

461
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,079
zero or something along those lines and

462
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,279
other than that

463
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,920
that should be fine so once you've got

464
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,560
that

465
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,440
just hit close which does save it um

466
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,800
there's no like save button but it's

467
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,320
kind of saving it as it goes

468
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,240
and then you should be hunky-dory you

469
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,360
should be able to

470
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,399
just hit um save on your g-code

471
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,160
so i i will just play this gif

472
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,880
in background for anyone who didn't

473
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,759
follow along

474
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,880
just because that talks through the

475
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,039
steps as well

476
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,079
and in the meantime i'm going to export

477
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,160
this g-code

478
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,119
and oh it helps if i actually put the

479
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,640
model on a bed which i hadn't done

480
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,199
before now

481
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,520
oh dear so yes i'm going to slice it now

482
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,280
and i'm going to send it to my printer

483
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,359
using octoprint um

484
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,919
has anyone not put the pause in does

485
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,240
anyone need another go of that

486
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,640
the script will be active next print yes

487
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,480
you do need to remember to disable it

488
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,559
thankfully in cura now it didn't used to

489
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,240
do this but thankfully now it has this

490
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,039
little

491
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,160
alert down when you're slicing um which

492
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,840
is like hey you've got a post-processing

493
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,520
script on because i think

494
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,760
yeah lots of people did what i did and

495
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
forgot about it and left it on then you

496
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,160
just had to

497
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,440
hit go again on your next print so yes

498
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,919
okay you can pause manually that should

499
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,679
be fine just try and pause it layer

500
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,400
three ish

501
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,120
or two and a half or whatever just as

502
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,320
long as it's around three it should be

503
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,160
good

504
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,600
cool um yes so you do have to remember

505
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,280
to disable it to disable it for your

506
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,120
next print don't do this now but

507
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
when you don't want to print on fabric

508
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,400
just jump back into that

509
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,840
settings um oh sorry extensions post

510
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,400
pressing

511
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
modify gcode and just hit that little x

512
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,919
button to remove it but don't do that

513
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,360
now

514
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
do that when you want to print something

515
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,640
not on fabric

516
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,919
but yeah you will have to disable it

517
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,000
again cool so

518
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,760
hopefully your print time will be

519
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,600
somewhere around half an hour

520
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,280
if it's not maybe just speed up your

521
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,960
print for the sake of this um

522
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,039
it might not look super pretty but um

523
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,559
hopefully it will finish by the end

524
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,280
of our session i do really want that do

525
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,480
you really want to give you a chance to

526
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,440
be able to take it off the bed and

527
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,400
everything so

528
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,600
yeah save it to file and

529
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,679
um yeah we will pop it in through

530
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,700
octoprint for me i've got it up here

531
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,360
[Music]

532
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,919
um if you haven't used octoprint before

533
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,600
really cool software

534
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,919
um it allows you to print remotely using

535
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:06,960
your 3d printer

536
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,080
which is very very fun um cool

537
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,240
alrighty i'm going to yes

538
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,919
hit print on that it's a little bit

539
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,919
noisy my machine i've tried to find a

540
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,200
quieter place for it but

541
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,360
it just there's nowhere in the house

542
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
because i share my house with people so

543
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,720
a little bit tricky um so

544
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,640
we're just gonna have to deal with the

545
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,280
noise today

546
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,799
the nozzle does cool down during the

547
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,720
pause um but it should heat back up

548
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,520
again as well

549
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,200
before it before it um starts again

550
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,640
starts printing again yes octoprint

551
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,280
amazing

552
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,440
gina is a legend so i'm just reading

553
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,559
reading the comments

554
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,240
um don't put the fabric down yet we're

555
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,679
going to print to layer three so that's

556
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:54,960
what our pause was all about

557
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
that's why we inserted that pause so

558
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,240
we're going to print three layers

559
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,080
then the machine is going to pause for

560
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,760
us then we're going to put our fabric in

561
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,280
and we're going to tape it all down

562
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,840
and then we're going to continue our

563
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,280
print

564
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,520
um yes you can have a couple of minutes

565
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,760
to go put the print on

566
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,720
please do that now

567
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,600
share your house with animals i have

568
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,159
fish

569
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,960
and i have pet ants because i'm an odd

570
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,360
human

571
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,480
so yes go go do the print yep

572
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,559
mine's just warming up so we'll do that

573
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,520
and um

574
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,720
as those are going i thought we might

575
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,280
chat a little bit about some cool things

576
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,799
that i've seen people do

577
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,480
with fabric printing um oh actually no

578
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,320
i'll be doing that i might start

579
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,080
explaining how we're going to put fabric

580
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,520
down because i'll explain it before

581
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,039
and i'll explain it as i do it as well

582
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,799
so no one should miss out

583
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,639
but what we're going to do oh

584
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,559
before we set up the print probably

585
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,559
should put it won't matter too much

586
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,799
if you haven't set up your print yet put

587
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,640
down some

588
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,679
uh paper tape to print on top of it just

589
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,200
helps us when we're lifting it off

590
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,880
because there's so many small parts and

591
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,559
it's attached to quite a flimsy

592
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,200
material um we don't want to be like

593
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,159
jamming a

594
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,000
a paint scraper in there um because it

595
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,760
can break the fabric so

596
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,280
if you haven't already set up your print

597
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,880
put down some paper tape first

598
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,520
and we'll print on top of that that's

599
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,000
okay

600
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,520
it should be fine we'll just have to be

601
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,200
gentle as we as we flick it off

602
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,480
i'm sorry that was my bad

603
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,159
i might actually go put the paper tape

604
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,919
on mine now i will start doing a demo

605
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,440
over at my printer

606
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,039
um yes i will flick to this camera

607
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,159
marking tape yes like like 3m tape um

608
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,120
blue tape masking tape any of any of

609
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,600
that

610
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,320
should should work i will flick to this

611
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,400
other camera

612
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,760
right now and then

613
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,840
i will take you over to the printer

614
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,120
how's everyone doing we feeling okay

615
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,200
good got some thumbs up some nods

616
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
beautiful beautiful

617
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,840
awesome okay cool

618
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,440
i'm just gonna pop it over here at my

619
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,280
printer

620
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,760
and this is my bed i'm gonna be putting

621
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,080
down a bit of paper tape

622
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,600
sorry about that i meant to say it

623
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,120
sooner

624
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,880
but yes a little bit of paper tape to

625
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,799
print on top of it just helps remove the

626
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,679
print

627
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,760
um so that we have something we can pull

628
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,880
the print up

629
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,080
from you just want to try and

630
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,280
line them up with each other

631
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:55,840
pretty closely

632
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,880
cool so we are just warming

633
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,880
up and i'll put in my little

634
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,600
leveling doodad because if you're

635
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,559
putting paper down

636
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,880
you'll also want to re-level um because

637
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,240
otherwise it might be a bit squished you

638
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,520
might be all right but

639
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,120
i'm gonna level just to be safe

640
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,440
and it's gonna do that it'll be a little

641
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,320
bit noisy

642
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,919
it's particularly noisy when it levels

643
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,760
it's not quite as noisy when it's

644
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,180
printing

645
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,760
[Music]

646
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,280
but i'll step away a little because it's

647
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,840
kind of noisy

648
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760
24 minutes to prank good that's what we

649
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,840
want david

650
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,679
yeah this is my this is my little craft

651
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,360
room it's um

652
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,840
it's my happy place i um i think i can

653
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,039
yeah this is my room so that's my

654
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,039
printer that we're printing on right now

655
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,080
and this is where i'm sitting normally

656
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,559
i've got my window

657
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,640
um it doesn't have to be unheated but

658
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,960
you can make it unheated um i used to

659
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,640
print it unheated

660
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,960
all the time but the paper tape is

661
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,000
really just to

662
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,440
make it easier to remove so we'll be

663
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,039
lifting the paper tape

664
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,720
um and hopefully the print will come off

665
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,559
with the tape it just makes it easier so

666
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,080
we're not like jamming a paint scraper

667
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,039
in under there

668
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,799
um because that might tear the fabric as

669
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,480
we're like poking it

670
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,880
cool so flick back to this camera this

671
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,880
will be done pretty soon

672
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,960
oh yes they are my new painting oh thank

673
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,320
you jeff

674
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
yeah i just started to learn to paint

675
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,640
it's very fun

676
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,640
where are we there

677
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,559
yes it's very fun i'm enjoying it

678
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,600
so after it levels i'm going to get it

679
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,720
to start printing

680
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,840
oh it's nearly done all right click back

681
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,480
oh dear my mic is tangled sorry everyone

682
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,600
yes cool got your back hello

683
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,679
so i'll take this off

684
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,679
take off the leveling and we'll hit go

685
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,960
and it's going to start printing

686
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,039
and hopefully it'll just print hunky

687
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,360
dory

688
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,720
yeah she's going for it

689
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,159
i also had a question about thicker

690
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,000
fabrics and how to handle ah cool so

691
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,799
thicker fabrics

692
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,000
i haven't done too much work with

693
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,159
thicker fabrics but i do know some other

694
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,520
people have and i've had quite a lot of

695
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,480
success

696
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,279
sometimes you have to turn up the heat a

697
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,000
bit more

698
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,679
um purely because the fabric sort of

699
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,279
acts as an insulator

700
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,960
um so sometimes yeah you have to crank

701
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,279
the heat up 10 degrees

702
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,400
or more on your bed um and

703
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,080
so yeah then you can get into the

704
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,240
thicker fabrics if they're really really

705
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,799
thick

706
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,559
um they have a bit of a hard time

707
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,000
sandwiching between

708
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,320
the fabric like the the layers above and

709
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,360
below have a bit of a hard time

710
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,880
sandwiching the fabric so what you can

711
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,760
do

712
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,840
is cut little holes in the fabric so

713
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,120
that

714
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,360
the layers of the layers of plastic

715
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,799
above and below the fabric have

716
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,760
something to

717
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,039
adhere to um so yeah that's a way to do

718
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:29,760
it with like

719
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,240
polar fleece and stuff along those lines

720
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,279
um is to

721
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,120
yeah cut little holes where the fabric

722
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,960
can whether whether plastic can join

723
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,760
together

724
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,400
as it's sandwiching you don't need a

725
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,000
laser cutter but a laser cutter is

726
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,039
always awesome

727
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,120
so if this is the reason you're buying a

728
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,399
laser cutter go for it

729
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,120
have you experimented with setting a

730
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
standby temperature versus not

731
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,320
um i haven't

732
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,880
but please experiment um i'm all for

733
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,080
experimenting and if you can make it

734
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,559
better

735
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,240
let me know and i'll update my article

736
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,080
and um yeah

737
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,840
that would be awesome

738
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,360
cool uh question about tpu on fabric i

739
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,400
personally have never

740
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
successfully printed tpu because all of

741
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
my printers are burden machines and

742
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,840
every time i try to print tpu they find

743
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,080
new and exciting places to spool out of

744
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,399
so i've never had a successful tpu print

745
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,679
at all let alone on fabric so um

746
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,679
i have not done it but i have seen other

747
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,520
people do it um i know david curry has

748
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,760
done tpu on some stretch fabrics

749
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,640
um petg should be fine uh it prints very

750
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
similarly to pla it just has a hotter

751
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,279
bed

752
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,520
um so just watch it isn't melting the

753
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,399
fabric

754
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,640
other than that should be fine petg

755
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,840
should be fine

756
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,399
um flexible plies yeah you can oh cool

757
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,240
okay i might try that out online then i

758
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,679
might pick up some of that if i can get

759
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,120
it here in australia that's always the

760
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
struggle

761
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,720
cool anyone got any more questions for

762
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,120
the now

763
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,919
we good okay cool beauty well while it's

764
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,480
printing

765
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,279
i might do a little bit of talking on

766
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,320
some of the

767
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,760
kinds of techniques and interesting

768
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,840
things you can do with

769
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,960
this technology so

770
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,480
we have been talking a little bit about

771
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,399
fabric choices and um

772
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,440
we've got a question is it good that

773
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,640
some fabrics are melty do they work

774
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,000
better than this natural fibers i

775
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,399
believe

776
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,760
yes personally um so i recommend

777
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,840
when you're starting out using polyester

778
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,640
or nylon or plasticky based fabrics

779
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,559
um so yeah in with any fabric

780
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,600
there is two main two main

781
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,279
considerations when it comes to fabric

782
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,600
there's the fiber themselves as in the

783
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,360
actual

784
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,279
raw materials that make up the fabric

785
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,679
and then there's the weave of the fabric

786
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,760
or the the construction method it's not

787
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,200
always woven it can be knitted and a

788
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,399
bunch of other things too

789
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,240
but the construction method and the

790
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
actual fibers themselves

791
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,799
so fibers themselves if you're starting

792
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:57,440
out

793
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,600
go with something like polyester or

794
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,480
nylon

795
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,200
something that is plasticky and man-made

796
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,840
um

797
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,120
man-made in the sense that it comes from

798
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,960
a plastic not rayon

799
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,799
which is actually more like a more like

800
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,559
a natural fiber in many ways

801
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,799
because that way yeah it does melt in a

802
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,799
little bit with the nozzle as it goes

803
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,240
um which is helpful so yes

804
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,600
that fiber-wise head to that direction

805
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,799
you're starting out though i have seen

806
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,799
people have lots of success success with

807
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,240
lots of different things so

808
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,720
feel free to just try as well and then

809
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,159
in terms of the weave

810
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,440
nice open weaves work best so ones that

811
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,880
you can actually see through

812
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,960
and i talk about some good examples on

813
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,559
the next slide

814
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,480
so what i'm printing on today is called

815
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,679
chul and it's

816
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,919
usually made for like wedding veils and

817
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,919
stuff it's really really lightweight it

818
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,000
has a tiny little diamond pattern

819
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,600
and it's usually made out of nylon or

820
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,520
polyester

821
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,360
and it's a really good one because it

822
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,799
looks basically invisible

823
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,120
it's what i used to make this necklace

824
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,480
um and i'll hold it here you basically

825
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,840
can't see the fabric

826
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
it basically looks like this is kind of

827
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,520
floating which is kind of a really cool

828
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,080
effect

829
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,720
um so i really like it for that though

830
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,360
it

831
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,880
is a little bit more delicate

832
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,399
um so chill itself can tear relatively

833
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,120
easily

834
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,360
you don't have to finish drop and have a

835
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,159
link yeah

836
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,799
i thought i'd put one in the in the

837
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,640
little blurb thing but i will

838
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,039
i'll grab one off i'll try and grab one

839
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,399
off the u.s amazon

840
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,520
um but you can usually get it in rolls i

841
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,799
will

842
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,960
i might do it in a check um but you can

843
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,399
usually get in a roll they sell them for

844
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,200
like wedding

845
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,039
decorations and it's like a little short

846
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,039
roll um i'll actually have one i'll show

847
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,720
you when i when i cut some off for mine

848
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,840
because i'll cut it off a very similar

849
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,559
roll

850
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,159
so yes that's one that i quite like

851
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,679
using it's not

852
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,799
very strong though um it tears

853
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,559
relatively easily and this was my very

854
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,279
first

855
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,760
necklace and i've worn it to death and

856
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,120
it is starting to break

857
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,679
along some of these lines um i really

858
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:02,399
have worn it

859
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,279
a lot though so it can hold up pretty

860
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,320
well

861
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,080
um if you want a little bit more

862
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,000
strength but you still won't be able to

863
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,720
see through

864
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,399
net is a good one it's usually a bit

865
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,320
stronger um you can see through it a bit

866
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,600
more but you could like

867
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,720
if you're putting it against skin you

868
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,799
could paint it a tone that's similar to

869
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,000
your skin tone

870
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,159
if you were going that route but um yeah

871
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,440
you still can see it a bit more

872
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
but from a distance quite a good effect

873
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,039
and a lot lot stronger

874
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,039
these both have the advantages tool and

875
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,720
that both have the advantages of not

876
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,159
fraying when you cut them

877
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,919
so you can just cut them straight off

878
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,279
and you don't need to do any seam

879
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,799
allowances you don't need to do any

880
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,240
sewing at all you can just cut it off

881
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,799
and it's

882
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,399
hunky-dory fine uh yeah is it a problem

883
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,320
if the fabric is a bit stretchy

884
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,080
um not necessarily no and i think

885
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,279
there's actually some cool things to

886
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,039
explore with stretch fabrics

887
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,399
um if you if you if you stretch it out

888
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,240
before you put it on the bed or you you

889
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,360
stretch it out and then

890
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,440
um tape it down while stretched it will

891
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,559
kind of shrink up

892
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,760
around whatever you're printing so

893
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,039
that could be interesting um if you

894
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,640
if you don't have really good adhesion

895
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,320
with it with a stretch fabric

896
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
it might peel off a little easier than

897
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,679
non-stretch fabrics

898
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,960
um so i would try and use an open weave

899
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,679
stretch fabric like power mesh it's used

900
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:18,720
in dance wear

901
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,240
it's kind of like a net but it's really

902
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,840
stretchy um

903
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,120
so yeah i would try and use something

904
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,360
that still can the plastic can touch

905
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,080
each other from

906
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,440
each side it's got holes in it and you

907
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,679
can see through it

908
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,000
um a really quite strong fabric though

909
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,960
that still

910
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,120
is relatively see-through relatively um

911
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,559
easy for the

912
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,399
plastic to adhere to each other either

913
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,159
side of it it's organza

914
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,360
and this is used a lot as like a outside

915
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,120
decorative fabric it's quite pretty but

916
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,600
also

917
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,760
a lot in construction of couture

918
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,120
garments because although it is

919
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,200
extremely lightweight and extremely thin

920
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,600
it is also very very strong and this

921
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,399
usually comes

922
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,000
in polyester or silk

923
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,039
and yeah very very strong fiber if you

924
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,399
need a bit of strength i would go

925
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,039
organza the only thing about organza is

926
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:05,440
that

927
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,240
it does tear along the edges so you will

928
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,200
get grinning

929
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,080
you will um you will need to actually

930
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,279
finish that seam

931
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,480
so it's really good if you if you want

932
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,080
to make something to attach to an actual

933
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,559
garment like say a pocket or something

934
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,240
this would probably be the goer because

935
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,840
it probably would survive

936
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,039
in the wash

937
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,080
um oh cool what have we got

938
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,799
yes that looks exactly perfect that link

939
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:31,519
perfect

940
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,880
yeah and you can get shorter rolls too

941
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,399
if you don't want to either that's

942
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,760
pretty cheap for eight bucks

943
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,960
but you can get shoulder rolls of like

944
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,600
25 feet or whatever and that'll be or 25

945
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,799
yards and that'll be more than enough

946
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,720
like that's quite a lot

947
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,559
um stretchy net fabric power mesh

948
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,240
power measures use a lot in dance wear

949
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,679
you might have to find somewhere that

950
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,279
supplies fabric specifically for

951
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,600
dance wear um but yeah if you wanted to

952
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,440
make interesting stockings or something

953
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,640
that would probably be

954
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,120
the way to go though you could probably

955
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,480
use stocking fabric too now that i think

956
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,919
about it just chop up some stockings

957
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,200
give that a go

958
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,080
yeah has anyone got any more questions

959
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,600
on fabric before i

960
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,560
move on a little more

961
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,040
fabric choices yeah just those main

962
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,079
three again that i

963
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,599
that i suggest you try when you're

964
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,159
starting out is tule net and organza

965
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,280
and tend towards the um more man-made

966
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,918
fibers

967
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,599
like polyester nylon

968
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,839
felt sheets i haven't tried felt sheets

969
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,119
i think probably you wouldn't be able to

970
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,079
sandwich very well with

971
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,359
fetal sheets so you'd probably want to

972
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,760
cut some holes in it or

973
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
just see if it sticks on its own you

974
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,960
might also find the felt

975
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,320
little fibers may stick to your nozzle

976
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,719
um they might like gum it up so give

977
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,760
felt a go

978
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,918
but um yeah be ready to clean your

979
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,079
nozzle potentially

980
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,800
beautiful thank you julian ah legend

981
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,159
loving the links thank you very much

982
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,640
cool so i might talk a little bit now

983
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,520
about model is there an easy way in cure

984
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,000
to skip

985
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,880
whole layers eg physical fabrics not

986
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,680
sure

987
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,760
but it's not particularly hard to do

988
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,920
manually if you've never opened a gcode

989
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,680
file before

990
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,880
it's basically a list of coordinates um

991
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,960
and it's a relatively human friendly

992
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,400
language marlin

993
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,599
has a really good uh online

994
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,880
like library dictionary reference guide

995
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,800
reference guide i'll do all the

996
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,200
different g-codes

997
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760
so uh yeah it can talk you through

998
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,800
reading g-code

999
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
but basically cura is pretty friendly

1000
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,400
and that it exports

1001
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,800
every layer starting with layer 0 layer

1002
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,920
1 layer 2.

1003
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,960
so all you would have to do i think

1004
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,560
is delete a layer or maybe even just

1005
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,680
change the zed height as it moves

1006
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,040
between layers

1007
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,400
it might be one to might be one to check

1008
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,320
um but yeah you you could investigate it

1009
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,079
you probably you might not need to

1010
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:00,640
though

1011
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,119
like just give it a go because it the

1012
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,400
nozzle does push down

1013
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,839
and it's kind of a triangular shape so

1014
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,079
it sort of irons it so just try it

1015
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,839
first um before over complicating it i

1016
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,280
think

1017
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,839
uh cool all right models a little bit of

1018
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,359
talk about models and when you're making

1019
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,240
your models

1020
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,560
you want to make them so they have quite

1021
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,480
a bit of gap in between so they actually

1022
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,920
can fold and move around

1023
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,040
each other um and yeah because if you

1024
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,200
make really large parts

1025
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,400
they might like kind of

1026
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,720
pinch at areas and it might weigh your

1027
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,000
fabric quicker so

1028
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,480
you want to make lots of little segments

1029
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,520
so something like

1030
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,720
what we're printing now this little

1031
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,040
hexagon pattern is really good um

1032
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,079
and this kind of necklace where there's

1033
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,040
lots of little open

1034
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,440
parts for it to kind of move around on

1035
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
i've used three millimeter gaps between

1036
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,400
each of these

1037
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,880
and it seems to work quite well so three

1038
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,000
millimeter gaps

1039
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,440
um you probably go a little smaller but

1040
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,599
i wouldn't go too much smaller than that

1041
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,760
um i have this model obviously you have

1042
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,119
this model already if you want the

1043
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,480
necklace i have that up on prusa

1044
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,040
printers

1045
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,560
i'll grab a link at the end and send it

1046
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,240
through but yeah just

1047
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,320
just another example like have them

1048
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,000
spaced out a bit

1049
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,280
nice little bits just kind of spaced out

1050
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,200
um yeah and

1051
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,800
that's pretty much it when it comes to

1052
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
models like you can think about

1053
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,160
um so part of the reason this one

1054
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,920
started to break was that at the points

1055
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,440
of things um

1056
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,880
it would kind of wear the fabric because

1057
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,400
as it moved it would sort of poke holes

1058
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,200
in the fabric

1059
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,800
so if you wanted to you could round out

1060
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,960
edges that might make things last a

1061
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,560
little longer as well

1062
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,839
but i kind of really like the look of

1063
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,920
the sharp edges so

1064
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,000
um it kind of you know you balance what

1065
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,320
you're what you're looking for and and

1066
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,839
with what what is long lasting i suppose

1067
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,560
cool so um yeah

1068
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,240
mine has just gotten to the pause

1069
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,160
section is anyone else still waiting for

1070
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,200
their paws

1071
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,560
on their machine still waiting okay

1072
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,079
we might talk about some cool people and

1073
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,920
some cool projects and some cool things

1074
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,920
that have been done with this technology

1075
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,160
and then um yeah in 10 minutes or so we

1076
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,040
will check in again

1077
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,200
and see if we're um see if we're all

1078
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,560
paused so

1079
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,119
i cannot talk about fabric printing

1080
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,200
without talking about david shorey

1081
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,440
he is the legend who came up with this

1082
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,320
technique

1083
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,960
and he does such awesome things with it

1084
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,400
um if you've ever seen this technique

1085
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:28,880
before

1086
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,440
it will probably be some of his scales

1087
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,280
which are these cool things and they

1088
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:33,599
look

1089
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,360
amazing when they're moving yeah wow

1090
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,000
[Laughter]

1091
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,520
amazing um and they just move

1092
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,720
so cool here's lots of different

1093
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,800
variations of this sort of scale

1094
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,200
claw pattern and they look really really

1095
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,800
awesome in cosplays i've seen them on

1096
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,079
like shoulder pads and

1097
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,040
gauntlets and it always looks absolutely

1098
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,680
incredible

1099
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,280
he has lots of variations on this too

1100
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,359
like some with like interchangeable

1101
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,360
um little on

1102
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,200
[Music]

1103
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,160
i don't i keep wanting to call them

1104
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,079
claws but they're scales really snap on

1105
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,359
scales so you can change lots of

1106
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,800
different colors and stuff

1107
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,240
um and yeah lots of different shapes i

1108
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,800
think this might be his most recent one

1109
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,839
he was also going to

1110
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,320
try and be here today even the audience

1111
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,160
make yourself known if you're here mr

1112
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,400
shorey

1113
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,880
but yeah he's amazing and such an

1114
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
incredible human

1115
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,920
really clever stuff so if you don't

1116
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,680
follow him on the socials check him out

1117
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,320
because

1118
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
even if when he's not fabric printing

1119
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,520
he's doing amazing things

1120
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,720
so that's some of his work he's also

1121
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
done some really cool lampshades

1122
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,720
where he has fabric printed part of them

1123
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,760
but also use

1124
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,520
little bits of poke out of the fabric

1125
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
and join them up with bits of wood

1126
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,680
so you don't necessarily have to use it

1127
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,599
as just a beautiful thing you can use it

1128
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,040
as a functional item as well

1129
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,400
and and um yeah interweave

1130
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,160
it's these processes with other other 3d

1131
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,280
printing processes

1132
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,880
so yeah these are really really cool i

1133
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,320
think they're actually in a museum

1134
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,599
i can't remember the name of the museum

1135
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,800
i should have written it down

1136
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,319
but yeah really really cool

1137
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,720
those fabric braces so called how they

1138
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,319
combine with the prints yes i completely

1139
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:12,720
agree

1140
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,560
completely agree he also has done some

1141
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,280
work in using these in a more functional

1142
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,880
context

1143
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,200
so this is uh

1144
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,480
oh my goodness fiberglass net um

1145
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,720
kind of like fly screen or like vent

1146
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,960
screening it's used to keep

1147
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,920
things from out of your house basically

1148
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,920
um but it's quite strong and lightweight

1149
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,079
and flexible and these are drone parts

1150
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,680
which obviously need to be strong and

1151
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,119
lightweight and flexible

1152
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,760
um and so he has actually reinforced

1153
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,920
these fabric prints

1154
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,560
these these 3d prints with the fabric

1155
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,040
and you can if you can see these have

1156
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,440
kind of cut on two different squares

1157
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,079
um and that's because fabric has this

1158
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,440
thing called bias

1159
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,280
which basically if you pull it at a 45

1160
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,119
degree angle it has a bit of stretch

1161
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,720
in that angle even if it doesn't have

1162
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,240
stretch in the like

1163
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
90 and zero degree angles like if you're

1164
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,480
pulling along the length of the fabric

1165
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,520
either way

1166
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,440
um so when you overlap them

1167
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,119
you know on a 45 degree angle like he

1168
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,040
has now you're actually eliminating that

1169
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,599
stretch

1170
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,800
in in that 45 angle so if you are going

1171
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,400
to be doing this for strengths

1172
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,920
that's probably a good idea and i think

1173
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,599
what he's done here is actually print

1174
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,400
some layers

1175
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
lay on a piece of fabric print some more

1176
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,079
layers lay on another piece fabric

1177
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,520
print some more layers so he sandwiched

1178
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,119
it a couple of times in there

1179
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,200
so it's nice and secure yeah it's

1180
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,440
basically 3d printed fiberglass

1181
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,640
yep oh cool i hope my

1182
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,160
10 second introduction to bias made

1183
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,760
sense

1184
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,400
i probably yeah i will make a video on

1185
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,599
it at some point because it's a very

1186
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,319
interesting

1187
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,520
interesting property of fabric that you

1188
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,200
can do a lot with but in this instance

1189
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,640
you'd want to avoid it because you'd

1190
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,240
really be wanting it to be quite fun

1191
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,720
well sorry

1192
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,000
is that a question no okay

1193
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,760
but yeah this is a very cool way of

1194
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,319
reinforcing 3d prints i think

1195
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,400
this technique holds a lot of promise

1196
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,760
for functional items

1197
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,040
particularly in things like drones that

1198
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,960
need to be lightweight um you know you

1199
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,520
can get

1200
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,319
carbon fiber sheets even and give that a

1201
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:16,640
go

1202
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,960
kevlar also comes as a loose weave

1203
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,480
before it's been laminated so you could

1204
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,040
even try

1205
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,800
putting some kevlar in a 3d print you

1206
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,720
know it could get really interesting

1207
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,240
from like a sort of material science

1208
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,760
perspective i think

1209
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,160
um yeah really really cool in the world

1210
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,240
of robotics i think

1211
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,319
david has also done printing onto

1212
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,079
stainless steel mesh

1213
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,160
um which i think is really cool he's

1214
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,079
made some beautiful origami things

1215
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,319
um and here are some of them this is

1216
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,680
actually a video i will

1217
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,040
press play this is a lamp shade

1218
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,480
and this one here is a cool

1219
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,560
pattern that kind of like opens up it's

1220
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,720
very cool i've actually been using the

1221
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,319
stainless steel technique

1222
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,040
to make houses for my ants the

1223
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,640
aforementioned pets that i have

1224
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,000
because you use stainless steel mesh to

1225
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,839
stop them escaping or other things

1226
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,280
getting to them which is kind of problem

1227
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,119
with ants

1228
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,400
and yeah you can 3d print kind of like

1229
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,000
we're doing fabric but onto stainless

1230
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,680
steel you do want to watch that you're

1231
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,359
not using a really good nozzle because

1232
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,160
um it will

1233
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,599
scratch the nozzle as it goes over the

1234
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,359
stainless steel and you also want to

1235
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,640
bump your bed heat

1236
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,599
really high um so he was using petg and

1237
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,319
he made it 90 degrees celsius um it's

1238
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,000
because the stainless steel actually

1239
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,800
wicks

1240
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,160
the heat away from the bed so you really

1241
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,040
want to crank it

1242
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,880
up quite a bit more than you normally

1243
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,280
would um like 10 degrees or so but yeah

1244
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,200
it works it's very cool um

1245
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,240
what about this is made of stainless

1246
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,960
steel so all this all this gray bit

1247
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,720
is all stainless steel the purple is the

1248
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,560
print and in this one too the

1249
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,400
the um the little lines in between are

1250
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,599
the stainless steel so he's sort of

1251
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,599
using it as a living hinge

1252
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,040
so all the gray bits of the stainless

1253
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,640
steel

1254
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,280
stainless steel mesh sorry it's a mesh

1255
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,319
like a mesh fabric

1256
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,599
um do i have some here

1257
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,160
ah not as a good thin piece but yeah

1258
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,079
it's like a piece of fabric that's very

1259
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,040
finely woven um yeah cool

1260
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,920
he also oh i'll talk about it a little

1261
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,440
later we'll talk about a little later

1262
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,800
how's everyone's prints doing have we

1263
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,720
got a pause from everyone

1264
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,400
pause anyone's still waiting for their

1265
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,040
print to pause

1266
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,760
no okay we might switch over to that

1267
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,280
then

1268
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,319
yours is oh

1269
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,480
okay oh my nina okay oh

1270
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,000
let's check that one after i'll

1271
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,680
let's connect on a social and we'll see

1272
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,960
if we can work that one out after the

1273
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,760
session

1274
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,760
um yeah cool so uh i will switch back to

1275
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,880
the other camera

1276
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,760
and we will lay down our fabric so what

1277
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,200
we're basically going to do

1278
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,760
is lay down our fabric and put some tape

1279
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,440
around the fabric just to kind of make

1280
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,720
sure it stays flat

1281
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,880
so using quite a bit of tape um you can

1282
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,480
use little bulldog clips but you'd

1283
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,599
really have to make sure the fabric is

1284
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:04,880
quite flat and it's a little bit finicky

1285
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,520
so for today we're using tape

1286
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,880
i'll flick back over cool

1287
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,640
so this is the kind of fabric

1288
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,319
roll that i have it's a bit squishy in

1289
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,079
the screen but i'm trying to

1290
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,680
get it in shot yeah so i it's

1291
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,920
very very lightweight chill you might

1292
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,359
even yeah you'll hardly be able to see

1293
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:29,920
it

1294
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,280
um but that's kind of what we want we

1295
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,680
want it to be nice and gappy so just cut

1296
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,839
a little bit off that is big enough to

1297
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:36,960
cover

1298
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,319
this the 3d print that's there so far

1299
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,560
if you have any drooly bits coming out

1300
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,599
of your nozzle

1301
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,440
get rid of those because they'll get in

1302
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,839
your way

1303
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,090
and

1304
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,640
[Music]

1305
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,119
you want to pop your fabric in and you

1306
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,480
just want to make sure you don't hit the

1307
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,960
nozzle with your fabric because

1308
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,599
the nozzle may still be quite warm and

1309
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,720
if you

1310
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,680
if you hit it with the fabric it might

1311
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,960
just melt the fabric

1312
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,839
which would be a shame

1313
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,760
so then just grab your tape again and

1314
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,280
just tape around the edges

1315
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,160
and just make sure it's not buckling um

1316
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,560
or

1317
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,880
like puffing up anywhere if it is just

1318
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,839
take the

1319
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,839
take the tape off and give it another go

1320
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,240
and

1321
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,599
yeah the best way i've found to do it is

1322
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,839
to just lay the tape down gently

1323
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,839
and then stick it down so lay it onto

1324
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,440
the fabric first and then stick it down

1325
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,000
onto the bed

1326
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,079
but it's relatively forgiving if there's

1327
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,920
a couple of buckles it should be all

1328
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,839
right

1329
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,920
but you want to get it as flat as as you

1330
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,599
can

1331
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,880
make it easy for the printer and just

1332
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,640
tape it all up around

1333
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,560
i'm just going to do four bits

1334
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,599
you can reuse the tape too i've used it

1335
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,040
for multiple prints before

1336
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,119
just like stick it to something nearby

1337
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,280
and reuse it again

1338
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,359
and so it should look something like

1339
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,800
that

1340
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,119
i will move the camera around a little

1341
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,319
so something like that nice and flat

1342
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,279
tape all around it

1343
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,839
yeah give that a go

1344
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,680
yeah the tape glue will stick a bit

1345
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,200
through the mesh you can also try and

1346
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,040
bring the tape outside of the mesh if

1347
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,880
it's a thicker fabric just like make the

1348
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,119
fabric a bit smaller so that the tape

1349
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,880
can cover a bit of the fabric and a bit

1350
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,359
of your bed

1351
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,839
um

1352
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,040
it's very odd nina i wonder um maybe try

1353
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,160
opening up the file

1354
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,720
and searching for i think it's g28 it's

1355
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
g28 or g29

1356
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,720
that should be the pause and just see if

1357
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,720
it actually is in the file

1358
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,000
very strange i'm not sure why that's not

1359
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,400
working

1360
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,920
how's everyone doing is it's making a

1361
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,480
kind of sense

1362
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,920
am i going too quick for anyone

1363
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,359
without printing on really thick fabrics

1364
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,119
could you skip glazed yeah

1365
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,200
um i think you can but you would have to

1366
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,040
do a bit of post-processing of the

1367
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,680
g-code

1368
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,200
so you'd have to probably remove the

1369
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,839
layer and change a

1370
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,000
you'd have to use because there's two

1371
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,319
different modes of g-code there's like

1372
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,119
absolute and relative um which is

1373
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,000
basically like

1374
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,839
the coordinates all chained to each

1375
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,400
other or they're a specific point

1376
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,800
in space each time and so you'd probably

1377
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,400
have to use the one that specific point

1378
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,839
in space each time

1379
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,920
and then yeah remove a layer you'd have

1380
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,359
you'd want to do but i don't want to

1381
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,200
give you a strict answer and say it will

1382
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,079
definitely work but

1383
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,760
there would be a way to make it work for

1384
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,160
sure but check out the marlin

1385
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,839
um g-code library that'll help you read

1386
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,599
the g-code which will help you

1387
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,559
work out what you need to do

1388
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,079
i'm going to get my print going again

1389
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,240
i'm just going to hit go so

1390
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,280
that um yeah

1391
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,160
it'll continue it's just gonna warm up

1392
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,480
again

1393
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,040
oh cool thanks mikey awesome

1394
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,359
yeah i yeah i think so alex and i also

1395
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,880
think if you're using a thick fabric

1396
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,559
cut little holes in it i think i have an

1397
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,160
example of it a little later on

1398
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,440
but if you cut little holes in the

1399
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,480
fabric then it gives the

1400
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,680
plastic either side of the fabric

1401
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,920
something to stick to can like stick to

1402
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,720
itself

1403
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,319
through the holes so if you're doing

1404
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,160
like buttons or something or

1405
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,240
little motifs cut a little hole where

1406
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,000
each of the each of the little

1407
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
motifs is going to go so it can kind of

1408
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,359
stick in almost like a

1409
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,920
permanent press stud or almost like a

1410
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,800
button i suppose

1411
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,400
it's like going through the fabric if

1412
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,800
that makes sense

1413
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,800
yeah have i missed anyone living hinge

1414
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,920
yeah so pretty much the same um so if

1415
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,440
you're doing a living hinge

1416
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,839
you normally would be printing it with

1417
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,200
like say a box

1418
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,119
a box here and a lid here and they would

1419
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,880
be joined by a little bit of filament

1420
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,800
here and it would like wrap around

1421
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,440
and you'll be able to close the box um

1422
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,040
so by living hinge just for anyone who

1423
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,160
doesn't know what i mean

1424
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,480
it's this thing it's like a really thin

1425
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,200
hinge

1426
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,520
um this one's actually glued but this

1427
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,119
method should still work anyway

1428
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,319
so a box and a little lid

1429
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,960
and yeah so you would print them side by

1430
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,359
side

1431
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,880
and do exactly what we're doing print

1432
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,880
three layers then

1433
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,640
put the fabric in then print the rest

1434
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,920
and you would just

1435
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,559
um tape the fabric around just as we're

1436
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:05,119
doing

1437
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,400
the only thing that would be different

1438
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,920
is that when you take it off the printer

1439
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,599
you'd also be cutting a hole in the box

1440
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,160
because

1441
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,359
otherwise it would be closed by the

1442
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,759
fabric

1443
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,599
other questions oh mikey

1444
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,240
ah look at you go awesome thanks mikey

1445
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,599
so yeah if you don't want to use the

1446
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,280
pause in pure or that oh that's not

1447
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,720
working for you give that a go

1448
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,400
oh we've got christina in here too so

1449
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,880
many friendly faces oh so lovely to see

1450
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,760
everyone thank you

1451
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,480
how's everyone doing have they restarted

1452
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,640
their prints have they

1453
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,000
got it all down they're looking good i

1454
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,599
got some thumbs up anyone still waiting

1455
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,280
delta was moving that's looking good

1456
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,800
just hit resume

1457
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,440
hunky dory all righty let's check along

1458
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,200
so i have talked a lot about david

1459
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,040
shorey because he's kind of amazing

1460
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,680
but there are also other awesome people

1461
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,319
so

1462
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:03,040
um sophie wong made an awesome piece

1463
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,839
which i think nina are you wearing

1464
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,839
did you work on this with sophie because

1465
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,119
you're wearing it very soon

1466
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,240
i made my own i was gonna do uh a

1467
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,720
similar design i gave up after one panel

1468
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,040
it was very oh well it looks cool just

1469
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,720
like on one breast i think that looks

1470
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,839
awesome

1471
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,200
yeah it

1472
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,280
i was like oh this is a great first 3d

1473
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,319
printing project

1474
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:29,440
it took me too many hours oh that's an

1475
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,720
evil first 3d printing project

1476
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,119
but that's the topic how it came out

1477
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,000
though um

1478
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,160
i have a bluetooth controller in it and

1479
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,760
i can control it with my watch

1480
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,119
oh that is so cool oh my gosh this is

1481
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,319
something i really want to dive more

1482
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:45,760
into i'm so

1483
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,000
newbie when it comes to electronics so

1484
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,800
hats off to you

1485
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,520
i'm in awe that's amazing so cool

1486
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,559
afterwards

1487
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,280
yes please i would love that that is so

1488
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,240
so cool

1489
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,599
yeah so um nina's got a live example but

1490
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,000
little

1491
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
leds you can poke them through after you

1492
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,440
do the 3d print if you've designed the

1493
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,559
model correctly um

1494
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,839
and yeah they look really really rad um

1495
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,920
i think and i saw this versus sophie

1496
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,119
wong

1497
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,599
does amazing work in the fabric printing

1498
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,200
space she also did a talk

1499
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,160
last year at hackaday super con um and

1500
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,960
uh this was

1501
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,880
one of the projects she mentioned and

1502
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,960
she also has another famous

1503
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,960
thrift fabric 3d printed project which

1504
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,240
is her dress

1505
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,440
which is amazing it is so beautiful

1506
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,200
printed in such a gorgeous filament as

1507
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,440
well and she's worked out a method for

1508
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,160
joining fabric prints together so what

1509
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,440
she does is she

1510
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,800
cuts off one side of one part

1511
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,880
and then overlays it to the matching

1512
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,960
part matching side of the other part

1513
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,880
and then she flips it over and with a 3d

1514
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,960
pen um

1515
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,720
kind of scribbles on the back to join

1516
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,760
the pieces together so they're

1517
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,280
sandwiched again

1518
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,040
which is a way you can turn smaller

1519
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,960
pieces you know the size of your bed

1520
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,720
into whole garments that look amazing

1521
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,680
so sophie i am in awe of her as well she

1522
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,200
does the coolest things

1523
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,599
and um she also talked in her in her

1524
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,200
talk which is on youtube um about

1525
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,319
the way you can control the way a fabric

1526
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,200
folds using this technique so she has

1527
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:17,760
all these

1528
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,040
like lines on her garment here and these

1529
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,160
lines here

1530
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,599
and they actually are the only places

1531
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,599
the fabric can fold

1532
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,000
so you can create sort of origami-like

1533
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,640
structures

1534
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,960
that are very repeatable um and and

1535
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,559
prevent a fabric from folding in another

1536
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:33,760
direction which i think

1537
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,559
is not only gorgeous but probably has a

1538
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:37,040
lot of

1539
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,880
sort of mechanical applications like i

1540
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,920
know um i was looking a few months ago

1541
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,000
there was an article about trying to

1542
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,760
make solar sails

1543
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,319
for you know space travel and how they

1544
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,920
would origami up

1545
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,319
into small spaces and then be released

1546
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:53,200
out

1547
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,280
and open up and i think this sort of

1548
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,880
printing onto fabric technique

1549
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,280
is is something that could be used to

1550
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,640
manufacture something like that you

1551
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,359
could print

1552
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,520
the circuits or whatever a solar panel

1553
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,079
needs directly onto a material

1554
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,000
in the pattern that it should fold and

1555
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,240
it would be a very repeatable fold

1556
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,079
and and i think that would be quite cool

1557
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,280
and very interesting

1558
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,079
yes thank you carrie beautiful it's a

1559
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,680
great talk she has awesome projects

1560
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,920
these are just one of her amazing things

1561
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,799
so very good talk

1562
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,799
definitely give her a listen and follow

1563
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,920
on twitter because very very cool

1564
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,280
um animal local friend steph piper

1565
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,440
um she's a medical engineer and all

1566
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,720
around amazing human

1567
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,960
here in toowoomba actually she's about

1568
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,640
an hour away from me

1569
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,240
has also done some really cool origami

1570
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,839
type things with

1571
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,240
the 3d printing onto fabric technique so

1572
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,680
these are some bangles she's made this

1573
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,200
is what it looks like flat

1574
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,640
and this is what they look like folded

1575
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,400
up and glued together and this is

1576
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,839
actually a whole little bag it's a

1577
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,040
little bit hard to tell from this but

1578
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,079
it's like a little purse

1579
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,520
and you can like reach into it and put

1580
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,119
things into it and pull things out

1581
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,400
and i thought that was really really

1582
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,400
neat it's very fun to hold um

1583
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,559
and yeah utilizing that living hinge

1584
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,160
technique of the fabric

1585
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,880
to add that strength along that join so

1586
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,440
yeah

1587
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,040
very very cool work from steph

1588
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,319
um this is like a little bit of cosplay

1589
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:13,200
this is um

1590
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,160
a hyrule crest from the legend of zelda

1591
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,760
so this is just a cute little necklace

1592
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,920
but another way you can incorporate

1593
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,640
um this into cosplay type things very

1594
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,160
very fun

1595
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,079
and these masks i love these these are

1596
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,240
beautiful a very very quick halloween

1597
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:28,960
mask

1598
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,960
you know like this would print in under

1599
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,319
an hour probably

1600
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:33,680
and you just add a little bit of string

1601
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,359
and bob's your uncle you got a

1602
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,520
quick halloween prop i think this is

1603
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,400
really lovely because again it's

1604
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,520
utilizing that tool

1605
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,440
which almost looks like nothing so you

1606
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,400
can do all sorts of things with this

1607
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,280
technique i think

1608
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,680
um on arms and i think this would be

1609
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,680
really cool like i think about um

1610
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,760
mystique from uh what's it called

1611
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,920
x-men if anyone's ever seen that how she

1612
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,280
has like this skin

1613
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,200
that has this texture to it and i've

1614
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,240
always thought if we were doing a

1615
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,160
cosplay of something like that or any

1616
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,240
kind of reptilian skin or something like

1617
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:02,720
that

1618
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,920
this would be a really good technique

1619
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,079
you get some power mesh and then

1620
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,799
3d print all the little scales or

1621
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:09,839
whatever onto them

1622
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,400
could be really really cool what's

1623
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,839
everyone thinking has this

1624
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,559
has this sparked any ideas has anyone

1625
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:17,920
got any ideas that they're like

1626
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,280
oh i could use it for that

1627
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:27,200
just just thinking bracelets for them

1628
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,760
the girls in the family yeah yeah

1629
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,480
definitely

1630
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,960
definitely yeah i didn't what was that i

1631
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,000
think

1632
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,119
just just bracelets for the the

1633
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,559
women in my family yeah just as a

1634
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,280
you know start to pretend just to see if

1635
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,680
i can do it

1636
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,720
on another note i think it will probably

1637
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,640
revolutionize the one to three pound

1638
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,799
combat robot division because

1639
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,520
if you can reinforce with very little

1640
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,480
weight

1641
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,440
to like carbon fiber standards that

1642
00:57:59,440 --> 00:57:59,920
would

1643
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,280
mean that a lot of the things that

1644
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,280
shatter don't shatter anymore

1645
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,920
hmm yes definitely and you won't need

1646
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,880
you know

1647
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,119
fifty 50 000 printer to add a bit of

1648
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,880
carbon fiber

1649
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,920
yeah or the cnc mill to work with

1650
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,359
aluminum and hope you can get it light

1651
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,319
enough

1652
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,520
yeah yeah i think it like what do they

1653
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,280
call it um

1654
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,839
composite composite materials are

1655
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,680
fascinating to me i i

1656
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,440
think they're really really cool um yeah

1657
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,440
and i agree i think that technique has

1658
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,520
a lot of potential it's pretty much

1659
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,200
unexplored because i haven't seen anyone

1660
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,480
other than david do it

1661
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,799
um so go forth make more robots

1662
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,599
i will be awesome that's awesome well i

1663
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,200
follow you on twitter so i will see them

1664
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,839
what i've got in the chat i better check

1665
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:51,119
that

1666
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,799
yeah print onto the mask and heat it for

1667
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,480
molding that would be really really cool

1668
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,680
yep beautiful yeah for um

1669
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,040
for respiratory masks or you know

1670
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,400
they're like covered masks that would be

1671
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,920
really really cool for sure you could do

1672
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,960
like interesting like

1673
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,599
i don't know faces lips teeth you can

1674
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,040
have a lot of fun with it i think make

1675
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,040
quite three-dimensional ones

1676
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,640
just don't use too much you want to be

1677
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,760
able to breathe through it that's

1678
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,760
important

1679
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,799
um yeah so snap some ball joints

1680
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:19,119
i have some more cool ideas so here are

1681
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:20,720
some more

1682
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,920
what was the woman i mentioned after

1683
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,160
sophie oh yes that's steph piper i have

1684
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,119
her twitter

1685
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,920
she's very cool lady um on her twitter

1686
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,079
is also a link to her website i believe

1687
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,319
yes she's very very cool and very worth

1688
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,920
a watch she's got some very cool

1689
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,960
projects in the works

1690
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,119
um and i love every chance i get to talk

1691
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,280
to steph we um we do women in 3d

1692
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:39,760
printing

1693
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,000
together um so we i often see her at

1694
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,559
that yeah

1695
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,640
so more ideas we've talked a little bit

1696
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,280
about different kinds of materials um

1697
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,880
but different textures even within the

1698
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,200
pla range i really like the silks

1699
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,440
because they are really shiny and they

1700
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,400
make like

1701
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,799
quite gemstoney looking things that are

1702
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,000
just really pretty

1703
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,040
um so silk pla is one to watch matte pla

1704
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,559
looks a lot like porcelain

1705
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,119
if you quite like that look um so white

1706
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,480
white ceramic

1707
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,960
um tpu one to try one i haven't

1708
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,000
personally tried when i've seen other

1709
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,240
people try and get success out of so

1710
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,599
that could be very very cool especially

1711
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,359
with those like claw type ones you know

1712
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,079
you can make

1713
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,079
interesting like cosplay stuff and also

1714
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:21,440
not take someone's eye out which would

1715
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,520
be nice

1716
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,000
uh yeah others may be too hot so if

1717
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
you're getting into like the nylon and

1718
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,200
abs territory

1719
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,319
might be too hot but like give it a go

1720
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:33,760
the worst thing you're gonna get is like

1721
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,400
a junk on your nozzle which you just

1722
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:36,720
wipe

1723
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,880
off with a bit of cloth so give it a go

1724
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,839
i say

1725
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,000
i'm all for just trying things one thing

1726
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,839
not many people have done but that works

1727
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:44,559
quite well

1728
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,839
is resin um so i

1729
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,720
made this little love heart-shaped

1730
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,440
keyboard

1731
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,119
this little circuit board came from a

1732
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,319
little cheapy keyboard like this one um

1733
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,520
and it's design i

1734
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,960
i'm making a thing called a cyber deck

1735
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,480
which is like a little tiny personalized

1736
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,280
computer

1737
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,200
it's um very silly and fun but it's just

1738
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,400
like a little raspberry pi laptop

1739
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,119
essentially

1740
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:09,599
um and yeah i wanted to be super cutey

1741
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,280
like everything had to be ridiculously

1742
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,400
cute because it was polly pocket

1743
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,119
inspired

1744
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,680
um so i made a keyboard base plate and

1745
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,720
tiny little love heart keys

1746
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,799
but they are printed in resin so i could

1747
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,480
get the detail on them

1748
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,640
um and yeah just print it onto a bit of

1749
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,680
chill just like this

1750
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,160
the only difference when yeah probably

1751
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,200
 cyber jack

1752
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,599
yeah it's a thing it's not yet complete

1753
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:32,880
but um

1754
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,960
it makes me happier than it should it's

1755
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,960
so ridiculously sweet and like

1756
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,319
just sickly sweet it's silly

1757
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,720
but yeah lots of fun so the only thing

1758
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,760
when you're doing resin

1759
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,880
is that you put the fabric on first

1760
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,960
so you don't do the pause insert fabric

1761
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,240
continue printing

1762
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,319
you i tried doing that and it didn't

1763
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,000
work it just failed every time

1764
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,680
so you just put the fabric on first and

1765
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,280
it adheres really well because it's like

1766
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,720
a liquid flowing in and around the

1767
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,200
fabric

1768
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,440
so i haven't had anything come off i

1769
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,960
think the fabric would tear long before

1770
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,920
it came off

1771
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,480
um so yeah you just and i just tied it

1772
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,480
on i didn't glue it or anything i just

1773
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,920
literally just grabbed the bitter tool

1774
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,599
and tied it around the bed

1775
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,079
of my photon and it came out perfect

1776
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:14,799
first go

1777
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,599
um after i well second go because that

1778
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,200
didn't work the first few times i

1779
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,240
tried with the pores um so yeah resin

1780
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,319
really cool resin is also really fun

1781
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:25,599
because you can add

1782
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,359
different colors really easily you can

1783
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,200
make any sort of color you like and

1784
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,520
you can add glitter which makes it super

1785
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,039
fun so you can make

1786
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,319
opals and things so for many many years

1787
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:39,280
um historically people used to wear

1788
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,079
actual gemstones on their garments um i

1789
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:43,599
i have a background in theatrical

1790
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,440
costuming so i love a lot of historical

1791
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,079
comments

1792
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,680
and yeah people used to wear like rubies

1793
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,119
and emeralds and all sorts of things all

1794
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,400
over their clothes

1795
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,720
um and we could bring that back but you

1796
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,920
know without the like

1797
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,480
having to dig up gemstones we could just

1798
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,000
print them directly on our clothes which

1799
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,960
i think could be quite

1800
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,680
fun um so yeah try adding a bit of

1801
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,160
glitter

1802
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,640
it's good fun um jewelry we've talked a

1803
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,599
bit about this already

1804
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,280
but yeah lots of different applications

1805
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,440
and jewelry earrings can be really cool

1806
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,640
you can make things like

1807
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,799
a ring with a patent in it and it kind

1808
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:13,760
of looks like the

1809
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,119
object in the middle of the ring is

1810
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,599
floating which can look quite cool

1811
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,799
but yeah lots to explore in the

1812
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,480
jewellery jewelry sort of section i

1813
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,280
think

1814
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,640
um 3d printing onto glass

1815
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,400
can also your fabric shifting oh no

1816
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,920
that's a shame um yeah might just be

1817
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,839
the the fabric had a little bubble in it

1818
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:38,880
or um potentially maybe it's slipped

1819
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,400
underneath the

1820
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,440
underneath the masking tape um

1821
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,880
if you can hold it down like if you can

1822
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,480
tape it down tape it down smooth

1823
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,960
now like with a bit more tape um if you

1824
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,640
can save it give it a go

1825
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,960
um but yeah otherwise just keep trying

1826
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,799
but you kind of get a feel for it um but

1827
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,480
yeah it's like 3d printing in general

1828
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,920
you know sometimes it just fails for no

1829
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,400
reason

1830
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,559
i think anyone who 3d prints probably

1831
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,000
has felt that

1832
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,760
um probably many times i know i have

1833
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,240
um yeah so 3d printing onto glass this

1834
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,839
is not an excellent example because i've

1835
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:13,599
got a little bit of marring on this but

1836
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,039
you can get really really shiny prints

1837
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:16,480
when you print onto glass and i think

1838
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,760
this is really cool because it kind of

1839
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,480
starts to

1840
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,520
mimic sequins and embroidery um which i

1841
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,079
think

1842
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,359
holds a lot of interesting promise

1843
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,359
because you can make sequins of any kind

1844
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:25,680
of

1845
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,720
size or shape or whatever david shorey

1846
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,520
also

1847
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,680
came up with this awesome technique to

1848
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,920
make holographic 3d prints

1849
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,680
and he has not put a film or anything on

1850
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,680
it he's just pulled it off the printer

1851
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,520
and how he does this is he prints onto

1852
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,200
diffraction grading

1853
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,720
which is this like optical film you use

1854
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,760
for doing optics um but it looks rainbow

1855
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,520
and holographic and very cool

1856
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,240
and you just print onto that um there is

1857
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,079
some tutorials out there adafruit

1858
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:56,880
did quite a popular one um and it looks

1859
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,480
really really cool so you could make

1860
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,319
like sequiny type things

1861
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:04,400
um and have the holo on the outside

1862
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,599
uh it's called a diffraction grating

1863
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:10,079
um i will put that word in the because i

1864
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,920
have an accent i will put it in the in

1865
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,440
the chat diffraction grading

1866
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,119
um and i think you need specific kinds i

1867
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,440
think the double doesn't work and the

1868
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,799
single does or something so check out

1869
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:19,839
the adafruit

1870
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,520
tutorial because i think that talks you

1871
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,119
through everywhere

1872
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,520
a glass bed yes a glass bed printing

1873
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,559
onto a glass bed

1874
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,359
um yeah so what you would do is the

1875
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:30,160
underside

1876
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,760
would become the good side of a 3d print

1877
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,520
onto glass sorry i didn't explain that

1878
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,039
very well

1879
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,480
yeah so when you're printing onto a

1880
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,720
glass bed the underside becomes very

1881
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,520
very shiny

1882
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,799
um which i think would be cool yes so

1883
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:45,280
hollow

1884
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,119
very fun david shorey again genius um

1885
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:50,319
some people don't like that word very

1886
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:53,440
very very clever well worth a watch

1887
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,760
and a follow i also think more on the

1888
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,799
embroidery chain

1889
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,559
um i again come from a historical

1890
01:05:58,559 --> 01:05:59,920
costuming background so i'm heavily

1891
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,760
inspired by old garments like i've

1892
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,599
always loved this gold work embroidery

1893
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:04,400
on

1894
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,319
old military jackets and so i've started

1895
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,000
3d printing little pieces

1896
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,520
that i'm going to put all over the

1897
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,680
jacket um so you can kind of do

1898
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,760
this sort of thing you could print that

1899
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,280
directly onto a piece of net and then

1900
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,480
lay it over

1901
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,720
a garment and sew them together so

1902
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,960
they'll become one

1903
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,559
and different textures and stuff you can

1904
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,720
make little sequins um depending on the

1905
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,839
shapes that you're printing

1906
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:28,079
they'll catch the light differently um

1907
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,319
just like little cool things to explore

1908
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,000
as a substitute for glass pecs would

1909
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,920
probably uh okay cool i've never printed

1910
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,280
on pex before but that sounds awesome

1911
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,319
yeah

1912
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:39,680
definitely um yeah so this is

1913
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,760
this is a technique that i've seen a

1914
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,280
couple of people do i couldn't find a

1915
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,240
great example but

1916
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,920
you when printing under stretch fabric

1917
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,760
you can stretch the fabric

1918
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,000
first and lay it down um maybe get an

1919
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,680
embroidery hoop to do it

1920
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,839
and then you print onto it and then when

1921
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:54,720
you take it off

1922
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,480
the stretch kind of shrinks back up but

1923
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,280
it leaves like bubbly shapes

1924
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,880
where the 3d prints are because those

1925
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,960
bits try to remain

1926
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,200
stretched if that makes sense so it kind

1927
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,720
of bubbles up around them

1928
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,839
and i think that could create some

1929
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:09,760
really interesting textures and surfaces

1930
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,880
you could get like

1931
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,640
a plain fabric that looks kind of like

1932
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,319
it's got a crocodile print in it

1933
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:15,760
or you know something kind of

1934
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,119
interesting and textured i think it's

1935
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,599
like

1936
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,359
cool one to explore you could write your

1937
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:20,799
name in it and have it just really

1938
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,720
subtly show through

1939
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,360
um oh cool

1940
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,839
[Music]

1941
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:29,839
cool oh nice

1942
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,240
onto t-shirts that's awesome yeah super

1943
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,479
cool

1944
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,720
um yeah garments shirts i really like

1945
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,200
accent pieces like a little pocket this

1946
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,559
is i just laid this on the shirt for

1947
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:43,280
effect but

1948
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,359
yeah you could just sew a little pocket

1949
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,680
onto something little collar tips

1950
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,880
cuffs just like little areas of interest

1951
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,740
i think would be quite cool um

1952
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,640
[Music]

1953
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,640
more functional items in the garment

1954
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,319
sort of side of things

1955
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,799
you can create buttons and button holes

1956
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:01,760
so you can sew

1957
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,839
you can um so you can print a button

1958
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:05,599
straight onto the garment

1959
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,359
which i think is quite cool using this

1960
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,880
technique um

1961
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,760
and little eyelets this is also it's

1962
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,400
it's not

1963
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,920
that easy to see but this is a kind of

1964
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,000
zipper so you can actually slide these

1965
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,198
two pieces into each other

1966
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:20,158
and it creates an actual like attachment

1967
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:21,600
for these two pieces of fabric

1968
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,759
and i've seen people use it to create

1969
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:25,279
even like pool type zippers

1970
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,279
they print the zippers up upwards and

1971
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:30,000
then the fabric folds down and they can

1972
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,158
fold down that way actually they can zip

1973
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:33,120
it up together so

1974
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,158
you can actually print all the

1975
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:35,839
fastenings for your clothes straight

1976
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:37,120
onto them which i think is a really

1977
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,238
interesting technique

1978
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:41,359
yeah it blew my mind too david i was

1979
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:44,319
like whoa as well

1980
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,080
yeah so here's some more examples of um

1981
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,679
these are snaps or press studs i think

1982
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:50,960
in america you call them snaps we call

1983
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,000
them breast studs here

1984
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,799
um but yeah little like clips that you

1985
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:55,279
just

1986
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:56,640
print straight onto the fabric and you

1987
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,000
can clip things together so if you don't

1988
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
want to go and glue them all together or

1989
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,960
um

1990
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,560
3d pen them together using sophie's

1991
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,000
technique you might be able to clip them

1992
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:04,640
all together

1993
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,960
which i think is quite neat and cool and

1994
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,399
you can make these any shape too like

1995
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:09,759
you can make little flowers or something

1996
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,759
cute rather than just plain circles

1997
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,479
um yeah pretty cool we've talked about

1998
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:15,520
this one

1999
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,439
oh sorry anyone got any more ideas i'd

2000
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,198
love to just like get more ideas from

2001
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,279
people has anyone had any brain waves in

2002
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,080
the last

2003
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,120
seeing these kinds of things

2004
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,600
i find it depends on projects before

2005
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,279
it's cool

2006
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,839
yeah so yeah that's the artifacts um

2007
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:34,799
thank you christina

2008
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,920
that's all yeah i think this is the one

2009
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,040
this is these ones yeah

2010
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,560
oh fur ellie that'd be cool yeah

2011
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,399
that'd be very cool very very cool

2012
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:52,158
awesome cool

2013
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:54,158
um could make a good way to attach

2014
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:55,920
magnets to fabric capture the print

2015
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,800
yes totally agree i love a good magnet

2016
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,400
and yeah so you can pause it and as

2017
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,920
you're putting the fabric in or even

2018
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,520
another pause later on add a little

2019
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,239
magnet

2020
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:05,840
and it would be encapsulated in that

2021
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,760
fabric i once saw this beautiful

2022
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,280
beautiful set of curtains

2023
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,040
that didn't have curtain ties it was all

2024
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,800
these huge triangles and in the corners

2025
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,159
of the triangles

2026
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:15,199
sorry there were a huge triangle with

2027
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,960
kind of gaps of fabric in between and in

2028
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,239
the corners there were little magnets so

2029
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,440
you could just like kind of

2030
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,600
crumple them and it would like magnetize

2031
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,040
to itself in different places and make

2032
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,400
these cool crumpled curtains

2033
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,239
like in this kind of geometric shape and

2034
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:27,520
i think that would be really really cool

2035
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,800
and this would be a really

2036
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,159
cool way to make it happen i think

2037
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,159
thinly is a glowing or clear pla it

2038
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:35,600
could be used for glowing outfit

2039
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,080
yes that would be very very cool i

2040
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,600
really want to get more into leds i

2041
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,719
think there's so much

2042
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:42,320
awesome stuff that could happen in that

2043
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,840
realm uh yeah

2044
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,840
awesome wow such good ideas i'm loving

2045
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,199
it i'm loving it i love seeing what

2046
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:50,480
people come up with

2047
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,400
um we've talked a little bit a bit about

2048
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,000
living hinges already but just

2049
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,840
yeah a closer up example rather than my

2050
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,440
little tiny hand uh

2051
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,440
little tiny face um this is a piece of

2052
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,360
organza in there so against again is

2053
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,159
quite strong

2054
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:05,199
i actually glued this piece in um

2055
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,960
and doubled it over on the edges so it's

2056
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,239
not technically

2057
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:10,800
fully printed as a living hinge but you

2058
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,480
could do it in that method i described

2059
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,440
previously

2060
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,640
um as a living hinge and it it it's a

2061
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,600
it'll be a lot stronger than the plastic

2062
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,440
on its own especially pla like i know

2063
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,280
petg is sometimes used for living hinges

2064
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,719
but even then they don't last a

2065
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,080
radically long time

2066
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,920
um but with fabric in them again

2067
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,199
composite material

2068
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:32,320
um it's it would last a lot longer

2069
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,199
um so yeah oh it didn't change any

2070
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,679
seconds but the pores work this time

2071
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,000
fringes are a mystery aren't they just

2072
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,199
like bizarre

2073
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:44,960
who even who even knows

2074
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,280
um yeah another use for living hinges is

2075
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,400
this cool watch

2076
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,679
um so we're talking about bracelets

2077
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,400
before this is kind of along similar

2078
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,120
lines

2079
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,120
you can use it again as a sort of living

2080
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,159
hinge for watches

2081
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:00,000
um yeah i thought this was pretty neat

2082
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,600
and yeah i really just want to encourage

2083
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,199
you to experiment

2084
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:06,480
um give it a go see what works um please

2085
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,199
please please

2086
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,199
tag me in anything you do because i

2087
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,960
really love this technique and i love

2088
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,120
as you can see i love hunting down cool

2089
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,320
things people have done with it

2090
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,320
so um please share anything you do

2091
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,400
because i will

2092
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,679
gaze in awe but yeah color change part

2093
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:22,560
way through or if you have a

2094
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,920
multi-material printer you can do some

2095
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,600
really cool things too i think

2096
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,199
um yeah play around with resin

2097
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,199
um check out those the people i linked

2098
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,880
like david and sophie

2099
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,800
and steph they always are doing cool

2100
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,800
things with this sort of technology

2101
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,840
um but yeah how's everyone's prints

2102
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,400
doing

2103
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,080
are they still going mine's still going

2104
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,520
how's everyone else's going

2105
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,840
yeah i'm still going yeah cool mine is

2106
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,520
true it's very close

2107
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,280
but it's still going so wait a little

2108
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,560
bit longer

2109
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,320
oh it just finished there you go

2110
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,360
perfect timing but yeah

2111
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,520
i will flick over to my printer and i'll

2112
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,880
show you how to take it off

2113
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,719
um and yeah then we will continue on

2114
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:05,840
how's everyone doing we've got any

2115
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,000
questions right now before i jump away

2116
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,159
from my computer

2117
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:11,360
oh you're trying to print on mosquito

2118
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,440
netting that's cool

2119
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,560
very cool oh no

2120
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,600
ripped off maybe just make sure that

2121
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,880
yeah it's a it's quite flat um

2122
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,400
are you printing the pla or the petg

2123
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,320
ms square om square

2124
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:35,120
if you're like okay interesting um

2125
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,560
yeah try and make sure it's very very

2126
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,760
flat maybe try turning your bed heat off

2127
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,880
um just to keep it a little cooler and

2128
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,600
yeah give that a go

2129
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,120
a couple of fails it seems one way now

2130
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,120
yeah it's like anything i mean and

2131
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,120
especially in 3d printing

2132
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,760
everything's hard everything fails a

2133
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,400
bunch

2134
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,880
you will get it i believe in you um clip

2135
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,840
style the fabric

2136
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,760
yeah sometimes clips are good if you're

2137
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,000
using clips um

2138
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,080
on tulle you'll notice that there's like

2139
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,239
a there's that v-shaped pattern on the

2140
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:09,040
tool i'll skip back to my image of it

2141
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,040
so you can see what i'm talking about so

2142
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,080
it's got this sort of

2143
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,520
diamond shape rather diamond shaped

2144
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,040
pattern so if you're clipping with the

2145
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,800
tool you want to be putting clips

2146
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,199
that follow each other on this diamond

2147
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:20,000
shape so you're going to

2148
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,120
putting one here and then following

2149
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,880
those lines and clipping over here and

2150
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,920
putting one here and following those

2151
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,040
lines and clipping over here and

2152
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,120
clipping that way so it ends up flat

2153
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,640
because if you start pulling here it'll

2154
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,880
like bubble over here it'll make sense

2155
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,000
as you're playing with the tool it

2156
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,600
probably doesn't make sense now but try

2157
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,400
and clip

2158
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,920
a clip and then follow the lines the

2159
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,920
other side and clip another clip there

2160
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,320
um yes just follow the lines of the

2161
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,159
fabric when you're doing the clipping

2162
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:44,080
yeah that might work you might get it a

2163
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,519
bit a bit tighter

2164
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,000
okay cool i'm going to jump over the i'm

2165
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,080
going to jump over to the printer um

2166
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,040
because we're

2167
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,880
getting close to the end not too close

2168
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,080
but close enough so

2169
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,199
i will show you how to take it off

2170
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,480
oh if you've got a y shift you may have

2171
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,000
bumped the nozzle

2172
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,679
potentially um yes that is one thing to

2173
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:08,239
watch

2174
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,320
when you're putting the fabric in is

2175
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,840
don't bump the nozzle

2176
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,280
um yeah or the bed yeah

2177
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,280
bumping something will make it a little

2178
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,640
bit out of alignment

2179
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,840
um some printers will allow you to

2180
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,760
um like home it

2181
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,000
mid print and then it will like go back

2182
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,280
to where it was

2183
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,400
but uh mine doesn't so i just

2184
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,320
try not to bump anything it's a little

2185
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,080
easier with a delta thankfully

2186
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,239
um it's quite hard to you know you don't

2187
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:39,520
have the bed to bump as well as the

2188
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,239
nozzle you only have the nozzle

2189
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,520
and this one's pretty firm nozzle

2190
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,199
thankfully so yeah just peel all the

2191
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,679
tape up first and just as you're going

2192
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:51,679
be careful that um you're not pulling up

2193
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,080
the tulle as it goes because that might

2194
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,360
tear the tulle

2195
01:15:55,360 --> 01:16:00,239
um again the tool's sort of the uh

2196
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:04,000
the most delicate of the fabrics so now

2197
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,440
once you've got the paper once you've

2198
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,239
got the top layer of

2199
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:11,760
tape off start peeling these up

2200
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,719
um but just start peeling all of them up

2201
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,040
don't

2202
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,239
peel it all the way to your print yet

2203
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,440
because you want to kind of try and peel

2204
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,400
them up

2205
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,800
in unison with each other sounds a

2206
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,760
little tricky

2207
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,600
but yeah you just want to kind of make

2208
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,880
sure you're pulling them up at

2209
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,960
relatively the same time because

2210
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,480
otherwise it might pull one side more

2211
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,520
than the other

2212
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,640
but yeah you'll see it's just slowly

2213
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,719
hurt i'm getting on camera yeah i am

2214
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,719
it's like slowly lifting up and the

2215
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:39,280
the tape is making it easier to kind of

2216
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,679
lift these pieces up i don't have to

2217
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,440
get a knife or my fingernails in there

2218
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,360
and start um

2219
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,280
pulling them off so yeah pull them all

2220
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,000
the way off and then the tape

2221
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,320
should pretty easily just pull off the

2222
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,559
back

2223
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,280
but maybe not that end it looks like

2224
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,719
it's torn a little

2225
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:00,960
from this end if it tears on one try the

2226
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,000
other end and you'll probably

2227
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,640
be fine but yeah then you have your

2228
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,880
print

2229
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,719
and i'll take this camera over to the

2230
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:10,320
desk

2231
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,640
and i'll just talk about trimming

2232
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,960
trimming it off

2233
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,520
got all my little things these out of

2234
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,760
the way

2235
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,000
so just hey we can

2236
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,080
just check in the chat what printer do

2237
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,360
you think i've got a little any cubic

2238
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,920
castle linear plus it's a little delta

2239
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,120
which i quite like but i don't think

2240
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,679
they sell them anymore um i wish i had a

2241
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,120
rig or something to stretch the fabric

2242
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,400
you could try um you could try

2243
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,440
an embroidery hoop um and stretch it on

2244
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,040
that first and then place it down

2245
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,000
or um just cut the fabric a little bit

2246
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,080
closer to the edge of your print so just

2247
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,040
cut

2248
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,880
like cut it a sort of circle shape and

2249
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,800
then when you're placing the tape

2250
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,560
place it so that the tape is partially

2251
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,480
covering the edge of the fabric but also

2252
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,600
covering the bed

2253
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,560
and that might hold it down flatter does

2254
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,239
that make sense anna

2255
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:09,199
am i explaining that well i'm not quite

2256
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:09,600
sure

2257
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,640
but yeah like if you were to cut the

2258
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,159
fabric off a little bit before you place

2259
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:12,800
it on the bed

2260
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,800
then you could have the the tape would

2261
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,400
touch directly to the bed

2262
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,480
and to or directly to the tape on the

2263
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,719
bed and to the fabric so it might hold

2264
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,719
it just a wee bit flatter yeah cool good

2265
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,360
good

2266
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,440
and yeah not all masking tapes are equal

2267
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,640
that blue tape is

2268
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,480
it is really high quality that is true

2269
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,679
yes so once you have your print um

2270
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:35,840
if you want to you can cut around it so

2271
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,320
that's what i did for this necklace

2272
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,719
is i just went along with a little sharp

2273
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:43,040
pair of scissors

2274
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,360
and just literally trimmed around the

2275
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,800
edges

2276
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,480
probably you want some fabric-y type

2277
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,480
scissors um

2278
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,440
because it'll make it a little bit

2279
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,400
easier though tulle is quite delicate so

2280
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,560
kind of anything you could probably cut

2281
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,320
it you could probably even

2282
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,920
if you really wanted to dry do it with

2283
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,920
an x-acto knife or something but yeah

2284
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,679
just cut around the edges and

2285
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,520
i'm having a hard time leaning over in

2286
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,400
this awkward angle

2287
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,520
yeah i hope i'm showing this all right

2288
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,679
you can just trim it off um this pattern

2289
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:16,719
is really easy because

2290
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,719
you can trim every bit off and it will

2291
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:19,760
still stay together

2292
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,360
quite well um so this that's kind of

2293
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,880
what you'll get

2294
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,120
which is quite fun i quite like it and

2295
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,560
you could sew this down onto something

2296
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,280
now

2297
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,040
um you could if you could directly use

2298
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,320
it as a pocket you could

2299
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,520
hang it around your neck and call it a

2300
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,719
necklace um you could do all sorts of

2301
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:36,320
cool things with it um

2302
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,840
one thing i do want to talk about though

2303
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,840
is that

2304
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,440
sometimes you want to leave a bit of

2305
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,280
extra fabric

2306
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,600
i'm going to hope that this shows up so

2307
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,040
there's actually a bit of fabric across

2308
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,159
here

2309
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,840
very hard to see maybe if i put it on

2310
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,560
against something black

2311
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,880
oh no i've lost you all

2312
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,159
what did i hit okay

2313
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:04,320
f11 or something sorry everyone can you

2314
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,520
still see me

2315
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,719
yes you can still see we're good

2316
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:11,120
i just couldn't see you oh that's okay

2317
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,239
um so yeah

2318
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,280
i'm just showing this because it's on

2319
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,320
the bit of black yeah we can see the

2320
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,920
fabric a bit better now

2321
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,440
there's actually a bit of fabric here

2322
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,360
and this bit of fabric i left purely to

2323
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,360
just hold all these pieces together

2324
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,199
um and hold them like sort of bridge

2325
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:24,639
between these two pieces because if i

2326
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:25,280
didn't

2327
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,040
these bits would sort of flop down and

2328
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,400
this bit would sort of collapse in on

2329
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,360
itself a bit

2330
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,679
so sometimes depending on your shapes

2331
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,199
you might actually benefit from leaving

2332
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:35,760
just a tiny bit more fabric around

2333
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,080
it also stops it from tearing a little

2334
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,760
bit more if you leave a little

2335
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,080
bit around the edges so yeah depending

2336
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,199
on your shape you might want to leave a

2337
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:44,000
bit more

2338
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,120
and of course if you intend on

2339
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,400
sewing it onto something um

2340
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,199
then you will want to likely you'll want

2341
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:53,520
to

2342
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,639
leave a seam allowance um i don't know

2343
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:58,840
how to get back to my screen but that's

2344
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,360
okay

2345
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,360
anyway we'll go back to is this gonna

2346
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,040
work no

2347
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,600
escape i've never seen what my

2348
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:15,840
computer's doing before i'm so sorry

2349
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:19,520
unfortunately we can like talk to you

2350
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,239
but that doesn't doesn't lead you

2351
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:23,120
through the forest

2352
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,920
back to the window okay oh i got it back

2353
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,440
okay i worked it out i must have hit

2354
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,199
some shortcut and i

2355
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,199
i'm not sure what it was but we're back

2356
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:32,960
it's fine

2357
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,560
live demos um

2358
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,960
yeah cool so how are you all feeling

2359
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,159
about that

2360
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:44,320
good getting what you want feel like you

2361
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,760
could take it away and give it give it

2362
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,440
another go on your own

2363
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,320
and if not i have resources but yeah if

2364
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,920
a segment falls off how do you recommend

2365
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,280
you fix it do you particularly like glue

2366
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:53,920
pool

2367
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,040
um yeah so on these chul kind of prints

2368
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,199
they're very very unlikely to fall off

2369
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,560
um because they really are sandwiched

2370
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,679
and they're quite tight

2371
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,679
on some of the other fabrics um like the

2372
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:04,960
thicker stuff that we were talking about

2373
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,400
if you weren't cutting holes in it it

2374
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,760
might fall off

2375
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,040
um still kind of unlikely but if it did

2376
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,920
probably some sort of fabric glue um

2377
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,840
yeah glue is kind of hard on a fabric

2378
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,360
it never works fabulously well um but

2379
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:19,840
yeah

2380
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,600
fabric glue would probably be your best

2381
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,560
bet um

2382
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,360
yeah what was this have i gone through

2383
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:27,920
all of them

2384
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,199
printer allows but you might be able to

2385
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:30,719
make a frame similar to what's used with

2386
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:31,840
vacuum forming screen

2387
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,560
yeah yeah so like an embroidery hoop

2388
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,199
might work

2389
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:36,560
you can sometimes get square ones of

2390
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,239
those um but yeah a little frame you

2391
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:39,520
could stretch something over

2392
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,360
and even just clip it to it that would

2393
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,880
probably work quite well

2394
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,920
um yeah i'm using scotch blue um it's

2395
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,679
it's just like what a special one that

2396
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,040
has like this edge lock you don't need

2397
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:49,840
it it was just

2398
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,440
the one that they had at the store any

2399
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,120
scotch blue tape should work

2400
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,520
um yeah it's got to blue tape there's a

2401
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,320
good and

2402
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,840
i'm good in um yeah where are we at

2403
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,960
what have we got left yeah just

2404
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,320
questions comments things yeah you could

2405
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,760
print an embroidery frame i think there

2406
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,120
are some on thingiverse i haven't tried

2407
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,480
them before but i think i've seen them

2408
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,400
there before

2409
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,719
yeah give that a go um pop in any

2410
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:14,159
questions in the chat or

2411
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,560
unmute yourself and just chime in but i

2412
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,840
wanted to point you to

2413
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,120
some some extra resources and help

2414
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,920
um so i'm very involved in lots of

2415
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,560
communities

2416
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,800
um so 3d printing discord is the largest

2417
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,320
3d printing discord it's kind of like

2418
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,760
slack if you've never used discord

2419
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,760
before it's sort of like a chat platform

2420
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,120
you have lots of threads of conversation

2421
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,880
going on at once and yeah

2422
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,320
be happy to help you there with any of

2423
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,400
these sorts of techniques i'm also on

2424
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,360
twitter

2425
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,320
um and there's an article on my site so

2426
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,080
in the blog

2427
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,000
there is a full article with lots more

2428
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,159
words and there's also the slide deck

2429
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:49,840
that i linked to originally

2430
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,120
so um i will pop a link to those

2431
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:57,360
things into the chat

2432
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:01,199
so that's the article um and yeah

2433
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,960
it's a little bit a little bit older but

2434
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,040
yeah it's got the basic steps there so

2435
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,239
if you want to try this again

2436
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,679
and we haven't released this video yet
