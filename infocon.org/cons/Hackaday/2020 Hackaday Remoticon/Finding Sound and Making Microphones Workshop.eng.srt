00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,279
hello everybody

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,480
hello yeah

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,599
um so as um as mike

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,800
kindly just introduced us um i

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,359
am helen some of you may know me from on

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,439
from the old twitter and some of you may

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,160
not

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,279
um i make experimental instruments and i

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,080
write about them

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
i write for make magazine and i've

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,640
written eight books man this is our

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,760
night this is my ninth

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,680
this new one there it goes um and the

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,040
newest one that i'm writing

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,320
is my first one for adults yes which is

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,680
all about diy music hacking so

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,800
um finding sound and we're

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,600
making ridiculous instruments i've got

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,360
quite a few that i can show you

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,120
um at some point as well um

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,199
but also the point of today is to talk

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,920
about finding sound in our everyday

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,039
environments

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,600
um the noisy things that we can do and

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,079
robin

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,959
is my good friend and a music producer

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,400
as well so we're gonna

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
show you some of the things that you can

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,840
do with your

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,880
weird fans sound um and then

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,960
we're going to finish it off finish off

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,000
the the

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,119
workshop with making one of these

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,880
bad boys you may have got a slightly

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,119
eclectic hardware list

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,680
um it's not your it's not your usual

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,720
list of things

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,840
um that you'd be asked to um to make a

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,280
piece of electronics from

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,240
but this is a um an embroidery hoop

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,520
microphone

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,159
um that uses is basically humble and

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,840
mighty piezo

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,040
and that's suspended by elastic to help

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,119
the vibrations do some good things so

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,320
it's quite an attractive thing and we're

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
also going to make

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,960
one of these which is a pop shield which

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,439
helps

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,280
shield your microphone for some from

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
horrible sounds

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,479
so yeah we're gonna we're gonna make

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,000
make a microphone we're gonna do this

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
we're gonna shut and

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,360
make some some weird noises and we're

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,399
also gonna just

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,600
basically chat about music tech

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,038
and chat about sound hacking um

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,840
any questions that you have during we're

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,680
going to keep the chat window open

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,959
it is like a dream catcher mic um just

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,319
just thought of it like that

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,680
yeah um so if you've got any questions

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
or you want any clarification

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
or um or my favorite if you want to

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,519
share something that you've made or

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,760
ask for advice on your music tech

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,800
hacking

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,040
um please put questions in the chat if

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
you want to share something

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,440
um you can also okay

73
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,080
so what size plastic lid disc did we

74
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,519
need from the parts list very

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,160
engineering

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,040
question it just a rain a round piece of

77
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,280
plastic ours is cut from the top of the

78
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
yogurt pot

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,519
yeah um it's it's

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,080
whatever you've got i mean the piano is

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,840
50

82
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,959
yeah it's 50 mil as long as it's bigger

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,400
than the piezo yeah

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
so just has to act as a resonator so it

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,080
has to be bigger

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
because it has to have more surface area

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,840
yeah um but yeah you can you can play

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,800
around with that stuff

89
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,519
yeah i mean it's it's it's just um just

90
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,560
whatever you've got really

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,480
plastic circles should be between three

92
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,239
and five inches yes that's what i did

93
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:22,959
tell

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,879
that's what i told um sophie when she

95
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,959
asked me but you can also it doesn't

96
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,680
really matter

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,120
you can make it bigger if you want you

98
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,440
can more resonance yeah more resonance

99
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,799
how lovely

100
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,280
um all right so let's um let's start off

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,000
um

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,239
with mine's a little wonky does that

103
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,599
matter too much

104
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,760
your plastic lid thank you for the

105
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,480
clarification

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,180
it doesn't matter

107
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,500
[Laughter]

108
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,120
quite it's a little late for us here in

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,319
central european times yeah

110
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,879
mine was a little bit wonky as well and

111
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,560
what i did is i just heated it a little

112
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,840
bit with a lighter and then

113
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,120
straightened out a little bit and then

114
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
the tension will will will hold it and

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,959
then

116
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,879
hold it in place and can it be 3d

117
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,480
printed

118
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,720
i mean depends on the material can it be

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,279
stretchy tell a yogurt yes it can be

120
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,800
definitely any flavor yogurt is is okay

121
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,280
as long as it's not the flimsy like film

122
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,080
that won't work

123
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,280
no foil no foils

124
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,720
but it doesn't really matter the point

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,400
is that um

126
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
you can pretty much it's quite hacky

127
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,080
this whole thing is quite hacky

128
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,360
so um it you can use what you've got

129
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,680
basically i've not 3d printed anything

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,479
um i don't know i don't know if it would

131
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,520
work actually

132
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
no i mean what would you say it needs to

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,880
be flat yes

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,520
if you wanted to broaden your horizons

135
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,240
you could

136
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,759
also uh find an old biscuit tin

137
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,080
use the metal like aluminium or

138
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,280
something of that nature

139
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,720
from a biscuit tin or something like

140
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,560
that that's going to get you some really

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
good results yeah

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
as well um it's just you know obviously

143
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,520
this plastic suits

144
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,960
the aesthetic of this mic particularly

145
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,280
but

146
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,199
hey chuck some metal in there and you'll

147
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,720
get some great great sound

148
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,080
what we're looking to capture is the

149
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,560
vibration so anything that vibrates

150
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,600
or will happily vibrate is um is is

151
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,880
is good so um

152
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,199
let's start off with the idea of

153
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,800
feinstein because i think many people

154
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,919
wouldn't necessarily have

155
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,120
heard of found sound um

156
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
so um before before we go to that

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,960
basically that i like to start off

158
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,880
with um we can admit somebody here we go

159
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,680
um we'd like to i'd like to start off

160
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,160
with

161
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,600
a john cage quote um so john cage is an

162
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,960
experimental musician

163
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,479
um who is like the godfather of um

164
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,919
terrible noise sounds um but he's i'm

165
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:04,800
right

166
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
and he's famous for a bunch of different

167
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,080
compositions

168
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,639
um but he was also a um an electronics

169
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,680
experimenter and an

170
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,039
an instrument creator and a nice quote

171
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,680
that he's

172
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,039
that um that came from him um is that

173
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,160
there is no noise

174
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,080
there is only sound um so the thing that

175
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,800
i really like about about john cage's

176
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
work and about this kind of concept in

177
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,120
general

178
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,800
is that we have these preconceived

179
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,280
notions of what music is

180
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,759
of what noise is what is a pleasant and

181
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,199
pleasant sound

182
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,400
um but the reality is that all

183
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,680
music is made up um and all

184
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
instruments are inventions um and

185
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,759
throughout human history we've been

186
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,560
making

187
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,599
noises from rhythmic noises

188
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,479
to like vocalizations to creating

189
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,919
instruments like

190
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,080
um you know i went to the belen um the

191
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,360
berlin instrument

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,479
uh museum um a couple of weeks ago and

193
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,039
there was it was just like all full with

194
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,440
hundreds of different types of piano now

195
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,080
until

196
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,840
the um kind of like i guess like the

197
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,000
globalization

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
of western music before that became a

199
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,599
standard

200
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,160
you would see um so many different types

201
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,120
of regional

202
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,319
um variation in instruments even ones

203
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,440
that you'd consider

204
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,280
kind of like very traditional like the

205
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,240
the violin or the piano or whatever

206
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,759
now the the point is until 19 i think it

207
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,080
was 1955 i think it was common the exact

208
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,160
year but it was like around the 1950s

209
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,639
there was no such thing as

210
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,280
a global a right so 440 hertz wasn't

211
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,639
um wasn't an a until a group of dudes

212
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,840
in paris decided that 440 hertz

213
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,520
was an a at that time so music

214
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,240
and musical systems there's nothing like

215
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,919
this it's not like physics right

216
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,960
it's basically pretty much made up

217
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
um and there were a lot there were there

218
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,440
were a lot of people who would

219
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,360
make different types of instruments very

220
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,120
specific instruments

221
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,919
for specific use cases and throughout

222
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,400
the whole

223
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,879
of musical history it's only relatively

224
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,840
recently that

225
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,840
because an a is an a you have to have

226
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,400
like a piano need to sound like a piano

227
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,080
like all the way across the world

228
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,559
um which leaves a lot less room for

229
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,000
experimentation

230
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,519
i was speaking to this medieval

231
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,120
harpsichord um

232
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,719
expert um and and she was uh

233
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,000
shaking her fist at the um

234
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,399
so one of the one of my f one of the fun

235
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,360
things i've learned from

236
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,279
from from her was the harpsichord um

237
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,560
it's a very interesting instrument

238
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
instead it's like a piano except

239
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,240
it's plucked instead of hit with a

240
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
hammer um

241
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,880
and um the the hops are called fell out

242
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,200
of fashion for a political reason

243
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,560
um not for any kind of

244
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,080
musical reason it was just it was

245
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,839
associated with the upper classes of

246
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,680
france at a time when

247
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,839
it was kind of more during a girl to

248
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,399
behead the monarchy than it was to play

249
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,920
the instruments that were in their favor

250
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,399
so the

251
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,360
harpsichord was um something that fell

252
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,720
out of fashion just because of

253
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,480
um political reasons but um i think

254
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,519
there was like a thinning of the range

255
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,200
of musical instruments

256
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,080
um last century but one of the reasons

257
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
why music technology is so exciting to

258
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,320
me and other music

259
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,279
hackers like me and musicians who are

260
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,880
moving into music hacking

261
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,880
is that now with the birth with with the

262
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,440
microcontroller

263
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,320
movement like wood movement is overused

264
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,560
but let's say it here let's go wild

265
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,040
yeah okay so what with the whole like

266
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,240
microcontrollers

267
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,959
um and accessible electronics there has

268
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,519
been a

269
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,200
massive rebirth in these exciting

270
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,680
new technologies and exciting new

271
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,959
instruments that come

272
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,160
out of these technologies um so i think

273
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,399
at the moment there is a rebirth of like

274
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,920
the diversity

275
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,399
of music hacking which makes today a

276
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,200
very

277
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
exciting time to be somebody who's

278
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,360
experimenting with music

279
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
um and i think if there is time at the

280
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,680
end i will um go over some of my

281
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,320
favorite

282
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,800
microcontrollers for music if people are

283
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,320
interested in that because i've used

284
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,040
basically

285
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,920
all sorts of different um

286
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,120
microcontrollers to

287
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,600
make music with um and each of them has

288
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,680
their pros and cons but um i'd be very

289
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,160
very happy to talk about my favorite

290
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,279
microcontrollers

291
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,720
for music um

292
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,880
but before uh like but i digress so

293
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,440
that's why

294
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,959
i just wanted to talk about have a

295
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,040
little uh excited um

296
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,279
moment there talking about how how much

297
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,880
i am excited about the current

298
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,680
moment in music tech and music hacking

299
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,560
um

300
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,000
and one of the things that's really nice

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,959
is that our technology has become

302
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,880
simple enough for people who aren't

303
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,600
technologists to be able to use it

304
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,200
so robin's a great example in so

305
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,600
robin has been working with me the whole

306
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,560
summer um

307
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,839
and i've been teaching her about

308
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,200
different types of technology but

309
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,560
robin's background is in music

310
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,839
production

311
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,519
um but it's not like you have you don't

312
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,279
have to like be able to

313
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,240
use assembly now in order or like be

314
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,839
amazing at c plus plus

315
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,440
in order to make something that's

316
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,120
beautiful and moving and

317
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,279
and musical and i don't think that

318
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,320
journey

319
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,240
i mean you know robin's now writing code

320
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,760
in two plus plus and

321
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,200
but like that journey wouldn't have been

322
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,120
as easy or as um

323
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,160
as possible even five years ago no no

324
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,560
way

325
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,560
and our community has become more and

326
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,000
more and more open and we're sharing

327
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,279
more and more of these things so like

328
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,560
it's honestly a very

329
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,320
exciting exciting moment to be part of

330
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,920
um but we're not going to talk about

331
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,600
microcontrollers today or we're not

332
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,720
going to

333
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,880
um we're not going to focus on the

334
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,399
microcontroller today but we're going to

335
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,839
do like a super

336
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,360
low tech super fun entry-level

337
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,639
um um introduction

338
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,760
to find sound um

339
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,200
which is the idea um that you can go out

340
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,480
and you listen and you can find little

341
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,360
snippets

342
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,720
of sound um all around you um

343
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,760
do you want to talk about phones in a

344
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,240
little bit yeah sure um

345
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,360
so um thanks for that helen

346
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,760
i got pumped as well listening to you it

347
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,720
was great

348
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,320
um so um found sound

349
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,160
in essence um has just become this

350
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,600
collective name uh for um

351
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,560
oh i'm robin my name is robin hales

352
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,240
robin with a y

353
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,600
um so i'm a music producer i produce

354
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,160
music

355
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,959
um under and several different aliases

356
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,880
one which is white rabbit frequency

357
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
if you're a happy-go-lucky person it's

358
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,920
probably not the right music for you

359
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
and you'll see with some of the examples

360
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,200
we show you um

361
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,519
there's a bit of a dark twist but what

362
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,360
we want to show you is travelling

363
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,959
yeah but what we want to show you is how

364
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,959
uh transformational uh sound

365
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,079
noise can be and found

366
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,200
sound enthusiasts are basically a bunch

367
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,440
of people like helen and myself

368
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,880
who will go out into the world or even

369
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,360
stay

370
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,639
at home we can use our

371
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,680
phones we can use these small

372
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,560
little zoom recorders if you want to get

373
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,160
a little bit more techy

374
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,680
in your in your sound recording

375
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,600
um and we listen out for appealing

376
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,199
or maybe even not so appealing sounds so

377
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,560
it could be the sound of birds chirping

378
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,920
in the trees um it could be the rustling

379
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,040
of leaves

380
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,440
which when you pause for a second could

381
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,399
also be

382
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,560
a massive group of people clapping an

383
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,920
audience clapping

384
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,000
so sometimes we'll also see that there

385
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,839
are sounds that are synonymous with

386
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,199
other sounds

387
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,440
um and we can get a little bit clever

388
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,720
with that as

389
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,000
you know foley artistry really plays on

390
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,959
quite a lot

391
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,639
you know a lot of the sounds that you

392
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,199
hear in films and telly

393
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,240
you know when people are maybe punching

394
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
somebody or walking upstairs

395
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,800
very rarely is that the actual sound

396
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,839
that you're hearing

397
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:40,959
it's just a sound that you've been

398
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,360
programmed to hear by foley artists over

399
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,160
over

400
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,360
the years but back to finding sound

401
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,320
itself

402
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,320
so you know what found sound enthusiasts

403
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,720
have really started to promote is

404
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,600
finding these

405
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,880
sounds and then essentially

406
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,320
loading them into um some form of

407
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,760
software um a daw a door

408
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,399
as i will refer to it it's a digital

409
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,040
audio

410
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,320
workstation um like ableton light

411
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,839
or garageband for example um and then

412
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,560
they will

413
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,600
manipulate those sounds to be a

414
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,120
key component in a musical track or a

415
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,000
soundtrack

416
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,160
or whatever the purpose of that sound

417
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,839
experiment is

418
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,959
so that's just the basics behind

419
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,320
um what found sound um is

420
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,440
and why people do it um

421
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
so there's um so there's three tools

422
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
that we'd use for fine sound and there's

423
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,240
one which is

424
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,480
like a as robin said there would be like

425
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,720
a recorder of some kind i've got one of

426
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,279
these

427
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,519
low-end zoom recorders it's an audio

428
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,480
recorder

429
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,839
which is a little bit better than your

430
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,519
phone but you can also find some really

431
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,079
fun things

432
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,519
just with your phone so that's straight

433
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,600
up recording the sound

434
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,800
but then there's two other things that

435
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,600
you can use as well one of which

436
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,279
come over here oh yeah okay thanks

437
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,519
can you ask me the piezos as well in the

438
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,839
little bag

439
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,000
um so um so there's two things there's

440
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,800
one that fight

441
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,079
you can um use to um

442
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,320
to work with vibrations you can't really

443
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,440
see that because of my

444
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
rubbish recorder but i mean there's a

445
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,639
brightness down on it

446
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,800
there we are oh yeah okay so here we go

447
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,199
this is a piezo this is an unsoldered

448
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,880
piezo disc um if you get a

449
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,120
um many you know it's very very common

450
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,480
and very very cheap electronics

451
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,600
component

452
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,079
and what this does is it picks up or

453
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:42,720
emits

454
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,680
vibrations um and this is what we're

455
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,199
going to be using as the basis for our

456
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,480
microphone

457
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,240
but um you can also use this to pick up

458
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,560
some

459
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,920
really interesting signs um around so

460
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,040
um i um let's get one with a lead on it

461
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,839
that's probably more useful so you get

462
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,280
them pre-soldered and i would always

463
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,679
recommend you get pre-soldered piezos

464
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,079
just because i mean i'm a very

465
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,000
experienced solderer and i still

466
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,480
crack piezo discs like there's no

467
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,280
tomorrow so

468
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,359
if you don't yeah they're so fragile

469
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,039
they're very fragile

470
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,160
um so this is a this is a little one

471
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
and there's like a medium-sized one or

472
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,480
um we're using a giant one for our

473
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,760
microphone today

474
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,840
and but any of them will work really

475
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,520
like i mean those are the yeah so

476
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,000
david says how does the size of piezo

477
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,360
impact things

478
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,880
it doesn't matter if they're smaller

479
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,280
like it's just gonna work fine um

480
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,240
this this one would work fine as well um

481
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,360
just the bigger one

482
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
yeah i think it's just it's when it

483
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,679
translates into your game staging

484
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,400
um so basically when the sound goes into

485
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,280
a preamp

486
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,320
or an amp um you know you might have to

487
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,760
with a smaller one

488
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,160
up your gain staging so how much signal

489
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,400
is actually going into your amp you see

490
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,679
and then you alter the the volume itself

491
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,440
yeah i mean to be honest like these are

492
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,600
cheap little components

493
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
you are not gonna get like a high-end

494
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,960
beautiful microphone

495
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
you know um sound you know it's not

496
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,000
going to be like

497
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,400
one of these bad boys you know um

498
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,600
yes remove the plastic casing yeah so

499
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,039
the reason why the pso's have the

500
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,799
plastic casing in many cases

501
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,000
um is that you can use them also you

502
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
can use them the opposite way so they

503
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,960
can pick up vibrations but they can also

504
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,120
emit vibrations and if you

505
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,760
encase it in that plastic thing that's

506
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,480
just a res

507
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
that's just basically um it's a

508
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,400
resonator so essentially all it is it's

509
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,320
like in the guitar body an acoustic

510
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,840
guitar a violin right

511
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,440
it's not the body necessarily that's

512
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,120
making the sound but what it is is

513
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,280
picking up that sound and amplifying it

514
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,400
because it's the hole

515
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,919
essentially so all of the sound waves

516
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,480
are like um bouncing around inside

517
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,640
inside the body of the violin or the

518
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,559
body of that piezo casing and then it

519
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,400
comes out so the black plastic casing on

520
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
a pso is just to let it

521
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,559
act as a as a speaker but in this case

522
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,160
we're not using it as a speaker we're

523
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
using it as a sensor

524
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,240
essentially if you do need to solder a

525
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,840
bear piece or any tips on not cracking

526
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
them yeah absolutely

527
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,120
um i um you would i would never

528
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,160
apply um so do the outside one this

529
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,600
outside one is fine

530
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,280
like that you're not gonna mess it up so

531
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
basically it's just like smd soldering

532
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
in that you need to make a little

533
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,240
pillow of solder first you just

534
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,679
just the point of your soldering iron

535
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,400
should be on

536
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,200
the um crystal bit of the piezo for the

537
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,240
briefest

538
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,000
time possible so any excess

539
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,640
time on the um any excess time on the

540
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,919
crystal bit will crack it

541
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,160
i mean sometimes if you crack your piezo

542
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,200
it's still usable

543
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,400
so it's not the end of the world um but

544
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,240
i mean and also but always like my

545
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,200
advice is

546
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,320
literally just a needle tip

547
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,039
i would always use a yeah it is it is

548
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:03,919
visibly

549
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,919
visually obvious when it was cracked

550
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,919
yeah and sometimes it's just like a

551
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,880
little

552
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
no never screw no no no don't scrape the

553
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,240
top layer with the knife

554
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,280
never no no no

555
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,880
definitely don't scrape the top away

556
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,480
with a knife what you do

557
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,120
is you just like you drop a blob and

558
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,280
i'll do this later i will actually do

559
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
a down facing camera and i'll solder up

560
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,400
one of these

561
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
um so that you can see the way that i do

562
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,520
it i think there's enough

563
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,039
questions about this that and people

564
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,039
will be interested to see that so i will

565
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,360
i will do a little live soldering demo

566
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,799
later but i would say

567
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,080
use a needle tip so the least domain

568
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,720
of of contact with your soldering iron

569
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,400
that your soldering iron has with your

570
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,240
piezo the better

571
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,360
so make it nice and hot i would use flux

572
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,000
as well

573
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,919
um but it's not necessary um i would say

574
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,559
i am i would never i wouldn't

575
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,840
necessarily

576
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,640
use a um a lead free solder um

577
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,559
i truly try and use lead free solder

578
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,159
these days um

579
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,159
just because it's healthier um but for

580
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,919
something as delicate as a piezo i would

581
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,120
i break out my

582
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,039
normal leaded solder to be honest

583
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,080
because it's just too fragile otherwise

584
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,240
but the point of this all is like just

585
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,520
buy the ones with the leads on it

586
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,480
do yourself a favor these are the favor

587
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,000
buy the ones with the leads already on

588
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,880
it right you know

589
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,200
it doesn't cost you know a couple of

590
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,039
cents maximum is how much extra it costs

591
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,919
just buy a salesman with the leads on it

592
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,880
um

593
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,960
so um yeah so the piezo can pick up

594
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,640
vibrations right so the way that we use

595
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,080
this and fine sound

596
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
is um some of you may have seen my

597
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
twitter video where i froze one of these

598
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,280
bad boys

599
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,720
inside a giant ice cube and then i

600
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,400
listened to it so basically

601
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,159
as the ice cube melted around this

602
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,520
um although actually i dipped it in

603
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,360
latex first so it was waterproof

604
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,840
yeah um as as as the ice melted from

605
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,640
around

606
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,559
this you could hear it's like the

607
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,799
amplifications of the tiny cracks in the

608
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,760
ice or

609
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,400
the amplifications of like me pouring i

610
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,440
called some fizzy

611
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,840
i remember what it was cola or something

612
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,799
i think it was whiskey

613
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,960
it was whiskey yes you're right it was

614
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,000
whiskey then

615
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,240
cola and so you could hear all the

616
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,919
bubbles so it amplifies

617
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,320
sounds that are already there but the

618
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,280
curious thing about

619
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,240
piezos is you know like some things you

620
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,440
think are going to sound

621
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,360
amazing and then you hook it up to a ps4

622
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,799
and you listen to it and it sounds kind

623
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,320
of rubbish and some things

624
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
sound incredible so it's all about

625
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,360
experimentation

626
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,280
sometimes things work sometimes things

627
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,960
don't um

628
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,000
i've had really great results um with

629
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,559
ice and water and i do have i do have

630
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,200
some

631
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,640
ice here that i i'm gonna um dip into

632
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,720
in a little bit and some chord marty so

633
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,400
we can listen to it

634
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,400
um and um so had great success with

635
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,640
anything water-based is really fun

636
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,320
usually really nice

637
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,000
um anything with bubbles is really fun

638
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,840
to listen to you one of the best things

639
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,720
to listen to

640
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,360
is a slinky you know like that child's

641
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,039
toy that's like a big spring

642
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,039
anything that's a spring sounds

643
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,480
fantastic

644
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,960
and it sounds like especially these long

645
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,480
slinkies if you

646
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,120
move them a little bit it sounds like um

647
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,559
star wars like some kind of like

648
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,720
laser effect if you shake a slinky with

649
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,760
a piezo on it

650
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,080
the piezo will create this sound that

651
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,399
just goes

652
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,919
that was super fun um yeah so

653
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,440
anything spring based anything

654
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,679
water-based anything with bubbles

655
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,559
chain-link fences that's really fun um

656
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,080
but yeah basically you just go around

657
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,679
and you stick it on things and then you

658
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,320
make

659
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,240
you wobble it around and you can can see

660
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,080
if it sounds nice or not sometimes it's

661
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,120
a bust sometimes

662
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,840
it's awesome you can make your own

663
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,360
spring reverb and they will say the

664
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,919
question

665
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,640
the vegan vampires demo vegan vampires i

666
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,600
don't know who they are

667
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,279
use tonic water would that be

668
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,960
interesting

669
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,360
yes crank sturgeon crank sturgeon

670
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
is worth watching so somebody's just

671
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,279
mentioned said that crank sturgeon has a

672
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,080
great demo of

673
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,960
various signs using piezo contact monks

674
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,400
slinky was amazing

675
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,960
correct crank sturgeon is um

676
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,840
do you know who he is no it's such a

677
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,760
weird to me he's such a weirdo

678
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,320
and i love it and he's like this niche

679
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,440
youtube guy

680
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,480
and he dresses up like a a ray and he

681
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:32,960
makes

682
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,400
like a sturgeon yeah yeah

683
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,799
um so oh wait there we are someone's put

684
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,080
someone's dropped a link

685
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,960
fantastic thanks david so um so good

686
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,880
question lee wilkins do guitar pick up

687
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,240
mike's work in the same

688
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,279
way no they don't but they do also still

689
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,919
work so the piezos are for picking up

690
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,279
vibrations

691
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,960
um but the really cool thing that you

692
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,120
can also do is this is a really

693
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,320
cheap um um dual

694
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,000
and i can't remember what was underneath

695
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,279
this one but it's essentially it's just

696
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,039
a really cheap guitar picker i think

697
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,720
it's like four euros on ebay or

698
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,760
something

699
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,919
um and what you can do with this so the

700
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,240
the piezo picks up vibrations that are

701
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,679
already there and amplifies them

702
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,120
sometimes in like really interesting

703
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,240
ways

704
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,360
but um well while these do they these

705
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,679
pick up sounds that don't necess that

706
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,520
don't actually exist

707
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,840
and and because they what they're doing

708
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,640
is picking up magnetic fields right

709
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,440
so um something that not many people

710
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,240
know about me

711
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,679
is that my father was um

712
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,400
an electronics engineer in uh in the

713
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,600
during the cold war

714
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,039
he was a british electronics engineer um

715
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,919
and then and he used to make these what

716
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,320
they call

717
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,600
circuit sniffers right so

718
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,159
sorry all right yeah jumping and

719
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:52,960
dropping it

720
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,000
um so basically these are these are

721
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
basically they detect magnets and they

722
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,960
solidify

723
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,960
um magnetic fields right um

724
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,320
oh what just happened here oh that's

725
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,600
fine i think we can still

726
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,640
still see me at pin video here yeah

727
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,960
so basically um if you run electricity

728
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,240
through one of these

729
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,880
um so if you if you you can it detects

730
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,120
uh changes in the magnetic field so what

731
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,480
you can do in um

732
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,520
what my what my dad used to do um would

733
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,720
be to create

734
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,960
these circuit sniffers that work in the

735
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,559
same way as pickups and basically you

736
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:28,960
can

737
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,120
hear if there's electronics in the wall

738
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,799
right so if you're sweeping

739
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,320
a room for bugs back in the old days

740
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,559
um it was um it would be you could hear

741
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,080
if there was electronics on the wall

742
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,919
basically and the same

743
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,360
deal with um with you with this

744
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,799
for fine sound um is you can listen to

745
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,159
things that have electronics so

746
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,679
basically you can go right you can like

747
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,679
if you wanna you can something that's

748
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,279
always really fun is to listen to the

749
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,480
microwave

750
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,640
um so like it's something that's really

751
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,720
fun always really fun is to listen to

752
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,480
one's microwave

753
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,200
i was gonna say an atm yeah it's also

754
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,640
really cool to listen to

755
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,679
yeah yeah so yeah a lot a lot of good

756
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,039
times from an atm

757
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,200
funny looks but good good yeah yeah yeah

758
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,120
if you do the same side people like what

759
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,200
what are these people doing yeah um but

760
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,799
yeah so so you can listen you can

761
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,480
sniff your and you can also listen to

762
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,399
your laptop and you can listen to

763
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,120
anything that's

764
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,320
um electronic and using a guitar

765
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,240
a cheap guitar pickup and yes so

766
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,360
i really like this because you're

767
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,159
listening to literal electronics

768
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,320
so um but they're not it's not sonify

769
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,000
it's it's not sonified in a way that

770
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,399
would

771
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,200
would be normal um so those are the two

772
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
things that you'd normally use so

773
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,679
the three things that you normally use

774
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,840
to find sound are you recording things

775
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,919
from your phone or a zoom

776
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,120
um to um

777
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,399
piezos to listen to vibrations and then

778
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,679
um pickups magnetic pickups to listen

779
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,880
to to listen to your microwave

780
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,919
essentially

781
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,360
so those are the three major things that

782
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,039
people do with thank you and sound and

783
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,720
then what you do with that sound

784
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,360
um after you've gone and find it is then

785
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,120
you put all of these different sounds

786
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,399
all of the you know the

787
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,960
cool vibrations they're like weird micro

788
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,440
microwave noises atm noises or like

789
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,559
the rustling of leaves or

790
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,000
you know whatever you find that's

791
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,600
interesting on the street

792
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
um and you put them all together and you

793
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,080
can make a really interesting

794
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,240
very exciting kind of like soundscape or

795
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,760
you can you know use it in your

796
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,440
music making or you could just you know

797
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,240
make nice little beats

798
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,159
um could you use it with an

799
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,320
electromagnet to modulate the sound it's

800
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,679
picking it

801
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,960
yeah i mean it would just it would

802
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,720
create interference so yeah

803
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,919
yeah modulate it yeah and someone says i

804
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,919
love the resistor tattoo thank you it's

805
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,679
brand new

806
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,600
um i have not shown this to the internet

807
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,960
yet so yes my resistor tattoo exclusive

808
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,399
exclusive hackaday exclusive my first

809
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,520
and only tattoo um

810
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,840
so yeah shall we okay that's been we've

811
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,799
been talking for

812
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,720
for i am part of the resistance um

813
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,679
um we are we've been talking for 37

814
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,480
minutes

815
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,720
um i think the good thing now is does

816
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,799
everybody have

817
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,080
a piezo and

818
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,520
did everybody get we all have a piezo

819
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,320
has anybody and do we all have um

820
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,679
a um a little a way of amplifying

821
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,320
that so i'm i've got a guitar i bought a

822
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,960
guitar amp um

823
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,480
but i also did send a like if you don't

824
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,080
have guitar amp there's like really

825
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,799
small

826
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,880
guitar amps that i sent um but you can

827
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,919
also like just

828
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,120
make a preamp kit if that's your

829
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,440
is it safe to use your real mixer

830
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,960
any tips for getting them out of the

831
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
plastic without breaking them your amp

832
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,640
doesn't function

833
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,559
wow oh no okay that's fine um

834
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,760
so on the on the mixer question um the

835
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
signal that is going into your mixer is

836
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
not going to be

837
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,240
insanely strong but what i would suggest

838
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,760
is just making sure that what gain

839
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,520
staging you can do on your mixer so

840
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
keeping everything turned down and then

841
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,720
modulating

842
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,000
uh the the signal um from zero upwards

843
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,440
is gonna be your best bet rather than

844
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,039
blasting it first

845
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,240
yeah all right um and then yeah you

846
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,960
answered the amp

847
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,320
question i did indeed um so

848
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,080
i have about 20 minutes set aside

849
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,520
now um to

850
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,880
for people to go so this is this is

851
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,480
this is um one of the piezos i've got

852
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,000
um it's um this one is is designed it's

853
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,159
designed for a pickup so this does have

854
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,520
a plastic casing but it's not for

855
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,039
resonating

856
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,559
um i have usb sound cards no it needs to

857
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,039
be

858
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,440
unfortunately no it's not a sign card

859
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,559
situation you need an

860
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,919
amplifier um in order to take to turn

861
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,159
the signal from your piezo into an

862
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,919
actual sound

863
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,200
um but it's okay if you

864
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,679
if you don't have a working piezo um

865
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,120
what you can still do

866
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,440
is the the point of the next 20 minutes

867
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
was to really go um

868
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,440
on like a sand scavenger hunt to go and

869
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,480
find

870
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,279
things in your house or in your around

871
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,320
your desk

872
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,679
that have a different noise and

873
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,760
if you have assaulted if you have your

874
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,919
piezo that you can use that you can plug

875
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:38,799
into your amp

876
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,440
that's great if you don't you can just

877
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,720
go around with your

878
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,360
phone and find some interesting sounds

879
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,000
and the point

880
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,440
is just that we're going to show you how

881
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,080
to chop those signs up this is only like

882
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,640
a mini

883
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,000
a mini activity yeah the the big the

884
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,200
the big mic make um is is coming

885
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,960
is coming after this but it was just we

886
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,320
just really wanted to

887
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,480
get you to go and actually find some

888
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,760
sounds um

889
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,679
for a few for a few minutes and we'll

890
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,519
we'll set up some signs so that you can

891
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,039
you can hear some as well so

892
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,159
for example like this is a um this is

893
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,200
just one of these

894
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,039
but in in a plastic casing with some

895
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,240
sticky stuff on it

896
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,880
i'm gonna i can stick this on a balloon

897
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,360
um

898
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,200
and which i can then play with a piece

899
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,519
of string and we'll show that i'm gonna

900
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,399
put one

901
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,440
that's covered in latex inside a glass

902
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,679
with ice and which you can then which we

903
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:30,720
can then listen to

904
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,320
as well um just on the scavenger hunt um

905
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,000
thing helen i was just going to say to

906
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,480
everybody some places in your house that

907
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,760
are going to be your friends

908
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,320
if you wanted to have a fiddle around

909
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,039
would be

910
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,919
um the bathroom is great and so

911
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:46,640
porcelain

912
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,799
surfaces and things like that i've got a

913
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,720
really great amplification

914
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,039
um your kitchen if you've got any

915
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,039
appliances your kitchen's actually a

916
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,000
naturally very

917
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,880
noisy place um it really really is so if

918
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,720
you've got a blender for example we

919
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,200
could slow that down into a drum beat

920
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,880
uh you know your toaster microwave

921
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,960
you know not just for picking up the

922
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,559
waves but actually

923
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,679
the sound it makes um your kettle

924
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,080
so lots of things like that as well um

925
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,760
you know if you wanted to kind of

926
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,000
explore the orchestra that's hidden in

927
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,880
your um

928
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,919
in your flat or in your house yeah yeah

929
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:24,320
um

930
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,000
listen to your coffee right now so if

931
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,440
you haven't if you

932
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,799
yeah that's great if you haven't

933
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,720
pre-sold it because because

934
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,640
there's so many different um pso's that

935
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
you can get on online

936
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,559
and but if you haven't pre-soldered your

937
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,799
piezo and where's this plus one

938
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,240
davis question um are we supposed to it

939
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,399
does pre-active polarity matter no it

940
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,679
doesn't

941
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,200
um the piezo polarity does not matter

942
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,440
um what you can do i don't because this

943
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,559
is the problem with having an

944
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,720
online workshop i can't see what

945
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,840
everybody has

946
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,039
in front of them so i can't give you

947
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,200
individual advice on on what you're

948
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,480
showing

949
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,519
um but basically i imagine that so most

950
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,640
people will have

951
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,719
one of these pre-soldered piezos um and

952
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,399
the other thing that most people will

953
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,839
have is either one of these

954
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,399
or one of these the two different types

955
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,520
of jacks that you can get for audio

956
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,199
um so essentially on this kind of on

957
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,239
this

958
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,159
wrong camera on on this um this is the

959
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,560
the input jack and basically there's two

960
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,239
little holes

961
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,560
and you would solder one end of your

962
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,159
piezo

963
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,800
um to one of these holes and the other

964
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,280
one

965
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,839
to the other one it doesn't matter the

966
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,599
polarity doesn't matter

967
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,239
um so that would be just one of those

968
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,000
and then what you do is you put your

969
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,800
cable in this and connect it to your amp

970
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,159
and the other thing you might have is

971
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,359
one of these

972
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,960
a um a jack but what you do then is you

973
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,400
would unscrew this bad boy

974
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,839
um and here's one i messed up earlier

975
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,640
um but here we have um this this again

976
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:06,960
has

977
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,200
two um two places to connect your wire

978
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,960
in and that would just be the same thing

979
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,599
so the short leads um or should you

980
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,079
expect

981
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,520
extend it so basically with mine

982
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,640
um i would always extend the leads um

983
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
just because it's just such a pain

984
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,280
otherwise um but it depends like some

985
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:27,760
people

986
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,480
will get the pre the ones that um i

987
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,160
don't have one right here but like there

988
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,880
are a bunch

989
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,560
actually this this one will do so there

990
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,040
are a couple um

991
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,599
i think there are quite a few different

992
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,680
kind of pre-made versions particularly

993
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,960
if you look at like the

994
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,400
cigar box guitar community you can buy

995
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,560
um a piezo already um

996
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,440
soldered to one of these bad boys um so

997
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,800
you don't have to do any of that work

998
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,920
it's a little bit more expensive it's

999
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,400
like four

1000
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,960
or five dollars maybe um but depends

1001
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,760
what you're doing

1002
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,520
doing with it with the um

1003
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,640
with the this mic um i

1004
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,000
have um extended the leads

1005
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,359
here you'll see i've extended the leads

1006
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,440
and then i've got them going all the way

1007
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,200
down longer longer longer

1008
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,440
like that there you go yeah with one of

1009
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,400
these

1010
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,680
yeah so there's just the two wires to

1011
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,839
solder up

1012
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,839
there

1013
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,720
and then you can see on the inside let's

1014
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,440
just do that

1015
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,320
the beauty blogger trick there we go so

1016
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,240
there's two leads on the inside you've

1017
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,640
got

1018
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,200
um one soldered up to one and then the

1019
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,680
other one

1020
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,200
soldered up to the other there and then

1021
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,040
that just goes directly

1022
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,160
into my amplifier

1023
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,440
um so

1024
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,240
um we can do this if anybody is having

1025
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,160
problems with the soldering i can

1026
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,200
talk you through that as well um

1027
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,880
but what we'll do now is for those of us

1028
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,119
um should we do some demos of things

1029
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,400
that we can find

1030
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,359
while people are going um around and

1031
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,880
trying to find some noises

1032
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,000
uh demos in i don't like get um

1033
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,800
yeah like dunk mine yeah yeah let's

1034
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,960
let's let's listen to some stuff eh

1035
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,680
let me get a balloon so i'm sending

1036
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,119
people off now

1037
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,040
yeah well we'll we'll we'll be hanging

1038
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,480
around um

1039
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,000
like we'll be hanging around but like

1040
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,520
maybe for the next

1041
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,640
15-20 minutes um

1042
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,680
we're just gonna prepare some nice

1043
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,960
um nice signs for you all um if you've

1044
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,000
got any

1045
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,520
assuming just listening and filling an

1046
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,200
online cart that's what i imagine quite

1047
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,040
a few people were here to do is just to

1048
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,560
listen to us chat

1049
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,119
um and and make things if they if they

1050
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,240
want that's fine

1051
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,760
um if you have if you are just here to

1052
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,400
listen and you haven't got your supplies

1053
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,119
um especially if you don't uh if you are

1054
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:55,599
um

1055
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,359
if you're not like um let me just sit

1056
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,720
like that what am i doing

1057
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,400
um if if you um

1058
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,920
if you want to buy things that's the

1059
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,839
easiest just to have a little google for

1060
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,200
the cigar box

1061
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,040
guitar kits and you can normally get

1062
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,480
like a set of

1063
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,920
five piezos that are pre-soldered with

1064
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,640
like a

1065
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,560
one of these jacks that you can just

1066
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,320
plug something into and they're the

1067
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,760
easiest because they just arrive you

1068
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,560
don't have to solder

1069
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,000
anything you literally just plug it into

1070
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
your amp um and then

1071
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,400
you know you you go and have a nice time

1072
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,160
um listening to things so that's that's

1073
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,359
a nice option

1074
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,160
and one thing i would say is that when

1075
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,079
um

1076
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,800
did you key myself or amazon um well

1077
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,680
bear in mind

1078
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,280
like we're in germany so

1079
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,960
you know we don't we don't know like

1080
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,839
um what whatever you use i mean at the

1081
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:48,880
end of the day

1082
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,720
at the end of the day guys it's always

1083
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,000
gonna be

1084
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,760
give your money to amazon or give your

1085
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,920
money to your local electronics store

1086
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,480
so you know it's uh it's you know we

1087
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,359
just we just

1088
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,520
we just advocate do do what you can but

1089
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,640
yes you can find

1090
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,800
most of this stuff quite cheaply online

1091
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,200
using amazon or like ebay or whatever is

1092
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,000
cheap as well so

1093
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,920
how would i connect the piezo to a mini

1094
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
jack what do you mean by a mini jack you

1095
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,480
mean like um

1096
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
yeah i've got a future in the other room

1097
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,240
you mean like a um

1098
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,920
like not a guitar jack a headphone jack

1099
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,440
is that what you mean yeah yeah okay

1100
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,160
um it works exactly the same this is

1101
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,599
literally just because i've plugged it

1102
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,960
into my guitar jack

1103
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,440
um you can the the same you can get

1104
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,480
um these for anybody for the normal size

1105
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,119
ones as well

1106
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,599
as to how to connect it into an adafruit

1107
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,640
trellis

1108
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,200

1110
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,520
um i

1111
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,160
cannot help you with that but in terms

1112
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,760
of the wiring to a different size jack

1113
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,000
it doesn't matter it's literally just

1114
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,760
the size of the jack

1115
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,880
um all right oh another good thing to to

1116

time the ice was much better than um

1148
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,200
the sellotape yeah you can make a really

1149
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,640
interesting throat mic with all of these

1150

1173
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,560
thank you turn that right down

1174
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:55,839
send the game down

1175
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:09,839
there we go

1176
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,319
[Music]

1177
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,319
can you hear that oh yeah

1178
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,640
can you hear that wow that's really cool

1179
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,480
so i've just plugged in this is

1180
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,240
literally just a piezo it's just

1181
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,240
in a plastic casing

1182
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,839
um and you can

1183
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:37,760
you can start you can start to hear

1184
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,480
you can also hear

1185
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,760
can you hear them yeah that's crazy

1186
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,440
so that's literally just so it's picking

1187
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,240
up the vibrations from my throat

1188
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,960
which is a pretty interesting sounding

1189
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,720
um but let's put it inside

1190
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,839
down from there i like it it's good

1191
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,839
what's the echoey boom after the initial

1192
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,400
um impact cable oh yeah yeah it's the

1193
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,359
cable

1194
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,480
and when you put it in right

1195
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,240
oh you mean the impact when you're

1196
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,599
touching the piezo

1197
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,000
yeah oh it's just the reverb effect that

1198
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,560
we've got on

1199
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,119
yeah yeah oh the yeah

1200
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,319
the reverb so i'm using um

1201
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,200
a guitar a guitar this is dry this is

1202
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,920
this is

1203
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,760
dry you can hear that

1204
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,880
[Music]

1205
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,440
yeah so dry contact mics are very

1206
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,800
responsive to contacts correctly and

1207
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,000
then should we put the

1208
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
echo and reverb on to listen to the

1209
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,640
different signs

1210
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,480
and i'm just lightly tapping it there

1211
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,200
with my finger

1212
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,560
i wonder if this is waterproof it's

1213
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,240
probably not we can put it inside a

1214
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:08,880
balloon

1215
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,319
so the other so that's actually a really

1216
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,839
good thing so when you're working with a

1217
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:12,720
piezo

1218
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,200
um with um with any kind of water

1219
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,640
you obviously don't want to put the

1220
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,480
electronics thing straight

1221
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,599
in the water um

1222
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,480
which is um

1223
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,760
most revelatory um

1224
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,839
thing to say but the way that you can

1225
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:34,880
get around

1226
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,319
that is so i dipped mine in liquid latex

1227
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,800
and which works really nicely or you can

1228
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,640
just put it inside a balloon

1229
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,599
or a condom and those work really well

1230
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,400
as well

1231
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,760
so you'll often see piezos in water that

1232
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,880
have been

1233
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,000
um um have been

1234
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,720
have been coated in in in a condom which

1235
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,200
is then

1236
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,160
gaffer taped um round and round to make

1237
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,520
it waterproof so you can do all sorts of

1238
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,040
interesting things

1239
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,839
with those all right so we have a a

1240
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:08,800
working

1241
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,880
one of you all very nice

1242
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,160
um i'm gonna attach it

1243
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,640
get laid can you all hear that by the

1244
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,240
way like can you hear

1245
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,839
yeah you can hear that is it painfully

1246
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,079
loaded

1247
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,960
no all right good oh

1248
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,480
so let's listen

1249
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,800
to why is it so impossible to open

1250
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,240
sellotape

1251
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,759
let's listen to a bit of sellotape

1252
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,160
i wish i had a balloon i don't have a

1253
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,480
balloon

1254
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,520
so here's the piece pso

1255
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,000
um yes exactly bonnie so the sound is

1256
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,599
going through my guitar

1257
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,359
um which is down here um and

1258
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,880
um it's being picked up by

1259
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,400
this microphone which is just an

1260
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,720
ordinary piezo

1261
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,279
but you can

1262
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,720
attach this to a table it's difficult to

1263
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,480
do to demonstrate this and get the right

1264
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,800
nose as well and i'm just going to put

1265
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,839
this on the table

1266
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,240
huh attached oh yeah you can attach it

1267
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,040
to the wall

1268
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:34,319
attach it to my guitar there you go

1269
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,640
attach this to the wall is it funny to

1270
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,160
me now it might it might

1271
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,400
i'm gonna actually attach to my guitar i

1272
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,200
reckon that'll do

1273
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,400
i'm just gonna pull this guitar off the

1274
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,520
wall but it'll be worth it

1275
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,839
so

1276
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,240
well that's just not working

1277
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,319
but the english but you can make really

1278
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,000
interesting remains

1279
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,599
the principle remains the principle

1280
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,119
remains you can make some really uh

1281
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,960
thank you for your tape you'll take the

1282
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,280
advice there

1283
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,880
um so yeah you can you can attach it to

1284
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,040
this tape which is really fun

1285
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,160
it's stuck to my finger thank you

1286
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,520
all right i'll just watch you struggle

1287
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,800
because you never ask for help

1288
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,599
there we go all right there we go right

1289
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,920
okay

1290
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,079
ready yeah all right oh no

1291
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,160
i fell off there you go all right

1292
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,440
i just don't think it's gonna be it just

1293
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,319
doesn't feel short enough

1294
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:45,839
this also just stopped working

1295
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,400
completely

1296
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,720
the volume down on the far right hand

1297
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,480
side the volume is turned down

1298
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,240
oh my nose tender ah

1299
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,520
probably the cable well good

1300
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,400
technical fault

1301
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,839
i made a noise

1302
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,760
nightmare all right so

1303
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,119
hopefully um you've had some uh

1304
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,319
you've gone around and tried to find

1305
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,480
some noises and this is where it's

1306
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,319
really difficult for me because i can't

1307
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,079
actually see you or interact with you at

1308
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:30,960
all

1309
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,480
um but um

1310
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,839
that did exist so i think now we've got

1311
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,680
um do i spend like a little bit of time

1312
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,040
showing them what to do with the science

1313
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,480
yes sure if you want to show them how to

1314
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,400
slice it up we can share that screen

1315
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,640
right

1316
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:54,800
okay

1317
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,920
so i'm just gonna um uh

1318
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,040
show everyone how

1319
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,079
we can take those sounds um and then we

1320
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:04,480
can

1321
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,160
manipulate them so i'm just gonna take

1322
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,480
you very quickly

1323
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,960
and i'll try and do it as steadily as

1324
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,960
possible and i'm going to use

1325
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,000
ableton as the example

1326
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,040
um door for you guys so

1327
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,839
just going to share my screen

1328
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,760
here we go should be coming up for you

1329
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,040
all

1330
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,800
uh shortly if i can see a massive nods

1331
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,000
if you can see it

1332
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,240
that'll be really helpful cheers thank

1333
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,440
you

1334
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,880
so what we've got here guys

1335
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,440
um is a arrangement view

1336
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,559
in ableton you've also got session view

1337
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,720
which you'll be probably more used to

1338
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,920
seeing

1339
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,559
uh people tend to use session view a lot

1340
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:55,040
for

1341
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,880
uh triggering uh key samples and sounds

1342
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,079
um and that's you know a really great

1343
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,319
uh reason why people use ableton is

1344
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,280
because it's also

1345
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,319
for live performance however when

1346
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,359
we have a

1347
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,760
bit of audio that we need to work with

1348
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,800
we take it off

1349
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,680
the device that we've used so say we

1350
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,480
have

1351
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,839
a bit of audio that's a dot wav

1352
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,040
file for example and

1353
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,559
we can literally drag it

1354
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,240
from our desktop into an available

1355
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,040
audio channel so you can see right at

1356
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,800
the top that's what i've done here

1357
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,720
so this is um a cat purring

1358
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,480
uh so i'm just going to uh take you guys

1359
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,480
through this so just bear with me one

1360
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,960
second

1361
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,000
just want to move that down here lovely

1362
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,559
right so here's the cat pairing

1363
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,240
can you all hear that lovely happy cat

1364
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,000
great so what are all the fun things we

1365
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,800
can do with the cat pairing

1366
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,640
all right just going to try and move

1367
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,319
this down from here because it's really

1368
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,839
annoying

1369
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:18,000
right so what we do with this sample

1370
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,359
okay or the sound that you've gotten

1371
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,760
is we have to think what on earth is it

1372
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,280
that we actually want to do

1373
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,640
with this track so for me personally i'm

1374
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,520
thinking

1375
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,040
how can i make it into a dark trippy

1376
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,160
melodic soundscape that's usually how i

1377
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,720
approach fan sound um so i think this

1378
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,920
might at least be very

1379
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,240
interesting for you guys to see what i

1380
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,280
would do

1381
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,280
so that was the first audio track i

1382
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,040
showed you the one beneath that the

1383
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,800
second audio track

1384
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,960
you can see that i've got the same

1385
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,920
sample

1386
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,760
in there but i've done a couple of

1387
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,040
things to it

1388
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,440
if you look down to the bottom left-hand

1389
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,720
uh corner

1390
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,079
you can see that there's a sample menu

1391
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,520
that's come up and what i did

1392
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,200
initially was i have extended the sample

1393
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,319
so what does that do

1394
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,839
it slows it down right

1395
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,720
so it slows it down and then i also

1396
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,440
thought

1397
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,160
let's make this even more trippy let's

1398
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:20,880
add

1399
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,800
some echo and also because sometimes

1400
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,119
the samples that we record they might be

1401
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,559
a bit quiet

1402
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,040
i've also decided to use the glue

1403
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,000
compressor

1404
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,920
so adding some compression and bringing

1405
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,680
up the signal as well

1406
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,960
so what does this now sound like

1407
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,760
let me show you

1408
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,839
so let's do some live modulation shall

1409
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,839
we

1410
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:06,160
you hear that guys

1411
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,599
so you can see how

1412
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,799
you can see how we can then hear

1413
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:16,319
so many more sounds

1414
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:20,240
in this original sound the you

1415
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,839
it's so complex i love slowing

1416
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,880
down sound and as helen was talking

1417
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,599
about before

1418
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,000
we can tap into other dimensions of

1419
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,079
sound like different fields

1420
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,240
um we really start to see the

1421
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,319
complexities of how sound is actually

1422
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,119
made

1423
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,200
and just by slowing down sound we can

1424
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,160
actually really

1425
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,880
kind of create this universe and it

1426
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,359
really

1427
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,520
you you can get sucked into three to

1428
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,119
five hour sessions

1429
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,640
just building um amazing soundscapes um

1430
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,680
and what and what have you so this is uh

1431
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,640
how we kind of uh muck about with the

1432
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,520
cat's purr

1433
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,200
and then the last thing i want to show

1434
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,000
you as well which is a really cool uh

1435
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,760
thing that you can do um with uh ableton

1436
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,799
and you can use ableton lite as well

1437
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,839
um which is free um i don't think you

1438
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,119
can save your work

1439
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,079
but it's a really really great tool for

1440
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,000
you to use to just start like mucking

1441
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,799
about and

1442
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:22,000
maybe worth an investment but garageband

1443
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,440
is free and you can do

1444
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,559
similar types of effect modulation in

1445
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:27,760
that

1446
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,480
the next little bit i wanted to show you

1447
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,359
is just down

1448
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,240
um just down here basically i'm actually

1449
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,240
going to just quickly go back to session

1450
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,200
view

1451
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,920
um and just on to track four here now

1452
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,640
track four

1453
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,680
isn't an audio track it's a midi track

1454
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,160
um

1455
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,760
what's midi robin what's midi let me

1456
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,119
tell you

1457
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,799
so midi all right um

1458
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,720
do you know what i hate to destroy the

1459
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,160
illusion for those of you that don't

1460
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:56,559
know

1461
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,319
but it's not musical notes

1462
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,839
midi itself is basically

1463
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,599
um three categories of data

1464
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,240
essentially that's basically talking

1465
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,720
about

1466
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,799
how hard you want something to sound

1467
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,319
the actual value of the sound

1468
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,599
and the length all right so basically

1469
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,640
you have midi values assigned

1470
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,280
to the traditional notation system that

1471
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,559
helen was talking about

1472
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,920
earlier on uh thanks to those uh

1473
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,440
dudes in the 50s thanks that then got

1474
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,000
trans

1475
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,280
um translated um into midi i believe in

1476
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,319
the early 80s

1477
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,359
um as a language in essence to

1478
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:47,040
convey a musical notation yeah all right

1479
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,319
um so basically um why we've kind of

1480
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,520
switched to midi

1481
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,640
in this is because this little

1482
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,680
um thing in the bottom left hand corner

1483
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,040
is something called simpler now simpler

1484
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,119
is the uh is the baby baby sister

1485
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,640
to the behemoth ableton

1486
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,400
sampler which is a sort of a plug-in

1487
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,359
right an effects modulator and what we

1488
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,240
can do

1489
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,200
is we can literally drag our audio

1490
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,160
samples

1491
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,119
as we saw here so we can get take the

1492
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:23,920
sample

1493
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,280
you see me dragging it dragging it

1494
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,119
dragging it and i can just drop it in

1495
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:27,760
there

1496
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,880
all right so dropped it in there already

1497
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,079
go to session view back to track four

1498
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,160
um and then basically just kind of

1499
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,000
arming that

1500
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,280
set this off and record and so you can

1501
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:41,599
see

1502
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,400
now what i'm doing is i've highlighted a

1503
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,920
section

1504
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,520
so you can see there you can highlight

1505
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,680
your section so i've chosen that section

1506
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,480
there

1507
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,559
it's gonna move you all up there again

1508
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:53,599
um and then

1509
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,599
let's just uh make it a little bit more

1510
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:56,640
fun there we go

1511
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,839
right now what we can do is we can now

1512
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:00,720
turn this little

1513
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,559
uh this little sample by using our keys

1514
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,440
on our keyboard

1515
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:14,480
oh yeah back to the low

1516
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,319
so i've turned our cat yeah

1517
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,880
get down

1518
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,480
so you can see how

1519
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,640
we can we can basically take this one

1520
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,520
sound

1521
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,799
and we've now created a synthesizer

1522
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:34,079
of that sound okay you using things like

1523
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,000
simpler and sampler you can basically

1524
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,640
create

1525
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,880
your very own found sound synthesizer

1526
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,400
um and it's really really really cool um

1527
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,359
and it's something uh really accessible

1528
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,640
really easy

1529
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,160
um to be able to get that creativity

1530
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,119
um with your hacking abilities and

1531
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,280
that's what helen had kind of

1532
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,079
um or very much should i say touched

1533
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,760
upon at the beginning and that is

1534
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,880
you know uh finding that um uh

1535
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,280
additional focus onto creativity once we

1536
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,559
do the cool stuff

1537
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,160
on how we can actually create a

1538
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,079
beautiful product

1539
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,359
um of music of musicality as well um and

1540
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,720
that's what i really love

1541
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,160
about all the skills that i've been

1542
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,920
learning with helen over the past few

1543
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,880
months

1544
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,480
yeah i mean the electronics part of this

1545
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,240
playing sign is actually very small it's

1546
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:24,799
um

1547
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,319
it's just one of the number of tools

1548
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,760
that you can use to find these things

1549
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,359
and then start playing with and

1550
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,799
there's also a whole bunch of different

1551
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,799
samplers that you can use

1552
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,440
online and on whatever phone system

1553
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,040
you've got or whatever operating system

1554
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,240
if you have you can find different

1555
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,280
samples to play

1556
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,079
like basically if you if you google um

1557
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,920
sampler piano you'll be able to find

1558
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,640
something

1559
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,160
that you'll be able to plug all your fun

1560
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,920
samples that you find in if you don't

1561
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,960
have ableton

1562
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,280
yeah um but it's also it's a great tool

1563
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,640
if you are getting serious

1564
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,119
um about making um about making any kind

1565
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,480
of tracks or anything you do need to

1566
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,640
start using something like ableton

1567
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,440
and you know like i said um you can uh

1568
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,520
you can download it for free

1569
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,079
um and you can you can have a mess about

1570
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,400
on them on a limited version as well i'm

1571
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,960
not unable to representative don't worry

1572
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,079
just as as as a music producer it's um

1573
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,839
you know something that i use quite a

1574
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,920
lot i also use pro tools

1575
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,599
um uh i have used logic um

1576
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,400
also fl studio formerly known as fruity

1577
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:24,880
loops

1578
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,559
also um a really um uh decent door

1579
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,839
uh so you know the the sky's the limit

1580
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:32,480
really

1581
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,680
um but in regards to you know uh

1582
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,000
how quick we can you know muck about

1583
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,799
live

1584
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,640
you can see how quickly that was for us

1585
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,240
to do all right

1586
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,359
cool let me switch back over yeah

1587
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:48,640
no worries showing us that

1588
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,079
and then i'll show you how to make this

1589
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,559
um simple the simple make i don't know

1590
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:53,359
how many of you

1591
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:58,160
actually bought the um the workshop

1592
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,319
um i should use that term

1593
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,039
no no we do

1594
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:20,960
so let's show you how to make this um

1595
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,200
this lovely microphone so i'm just going

1596
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,640
to go through each of the different

1597
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,520
steps i don't know

1598
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,960
who's going to be following along or

1599
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,720
who's not but i guess this will be

1600
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,920
recorded

1601
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,960
so um so

1602
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,240
if you're not making it now if it's

1603
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,839
something that you want to make make

1604
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:36,640
making noise

1605
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,680
later on you can absolutely do

1606
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,839
this all right so here we go

1607
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:46,559
here is the finish this finished piece

1608
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:47,039
so

1609
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,680
if you've got a piezo with your

1610
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,359
pre-soldered wires

1611
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,520
and when you're purchasing a piezo as i

1612
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,880
said um

1613
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,799
i personally this is the smallest one

1614
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,400
sorry this is my thing so this is the

1615
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,880
smallest piezo mic that my electronics

1616
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,160
my local electronics

1617
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,680
store sells and then um

1618
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,119
the biggest one here and this one's a

1619
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,559
50 millimeter a 50 millimeter one again

1620
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,680
they both came with pre-soldered

1621
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,079
leads which is what i would recommend if

1622
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:21,839
you're not a soldering

1623
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,520
person if you don't have a soldering

1624
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,680
iron just go online and

1625
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,599
purchase a um purchase a pre-soldered

1626
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,760
kit if you just search for

1627
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,559
um cigar box guitar then you'll be able

1628
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:35,280
to do

1629
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,280
that so all you need to do is once

1630
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,599
you've got your two piezos

1631
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,720
there we are um yeah this this project

1632
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,640
will work with any size piezo i bought

1633
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,400
a really big one mostly because i

1634
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,839
thought it was really funny

1635
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:50,880
um and it was just it just looked nice

1636
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,240
but you can use you can use like a

1637
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,599
little one as well that would work

1638
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,359
perfectly well

1639
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:58,240
so what you need to do is um if you

1640
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,400
don't i'm gonna just admit sophie though

1641
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,440
yeah

1642
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,200
so if you don't already um have your own

1643
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,640
um piezo pre-soldered what you're gonna

1644
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,160
need to do

1645
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,359
is get two leads of wire

1646
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:16,640
and so two bits of them electronics wire

1647
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,359
and strip the ends of each of those

1648
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:20,079
leads

1649
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,359
um you then need to tin the ends

1650
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,480
of those leads of wire

1651
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,000
and then apply each um and apply each of

1652
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,319
them

1653
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:31,680
starting on the outside one and then

1654
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,599
going onto the inside one

1655
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:36,720
to your piezo do this extremely

1656
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,920
carefully and buy

1657
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,240
multiples because they can and do break

1658
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,039
as i said

1659
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,359
earlier so once you've soldered up your

1660
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:44,880
piezo it should

1661
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,920
look like this i would recommend

1662
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,760
when you're doing that adding little

1663
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,039
pillows of solder

1664
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,480
onto the base that you're using before

1665
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,880
you add your wires on so that you can

1666
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,920
just add

1667
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,400
the briefest touch of heat from your

1668
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,760
soldering iron

1669
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,880
in order to be able to connect those

1670
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:05,440
wires

1671
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,119
and these are quite fragile as well

1672
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,280
these kind of connections

1673
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,839
um so once they are soldered on i would

1674
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,520
always recommend adding some strain

1675
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,920
relief which i will come on to

1676
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,760
um so once you've got those soldered on

1677
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,000
i'm going to assume that everybody

1678
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,920
has got something looking a little bit

1679
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,359
like this okay so your your pre-soldered

1680
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:28,240
wire

1681
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:33,759
um what you need to do then is take some

1682
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,039
things falling down um take some um

1683
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,039
take some of this end piece off here

1684
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:42,720
what we need to do is if you

1685
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,240
have one of these it's like so get some

1686
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,359
wire strippers and strip off

1687
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,680
approximately you know like a little bit

1688
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,480
extra

1689
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,839
wire so we've got what like

1690
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:56,240
half a centimeter so i i would because

1691
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,200
we're going to be attaching this to

1692
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,400
another wire

1693
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,280
so go on ahead and like strip a hole so

1694
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,760
you've got like a centimeters worth of

1695
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,319
bare

1696
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:07,440
wire showing all right so you've got two

1697
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,799
pieces of these leads

1698
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:12,400
with two pieces of bare wire um

1699
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,160
two pieces of one centimeter long bare

1700
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,039
wire you then once you've got that extra

1701
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:17,359
bit

1702
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:18,640
stripping i can see that somebody's

1703
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,359
making along so i'll um

1704
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:22,799
a good so somebody's stripping that's

1705
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,359
good i'll pace myself to this person

1706
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:28,480
who is um so once you've got those those

1707
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,359
wires stripped um go ahead and get some

1708
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:33,119
ordinary

1709
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,280
um i've just used it's like quite thin

1710
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,200
gauge i cut literally i don't know what

1711
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,599
what gauge this wire is it's just

1712
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,960
random electronics bench wire

1713
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,039
and we use a different system and in

1714
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:46,319
this country anyway i don't know what a

1715
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:47,520
wire gauge

1716
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,720
means but just your ordinary electronics

1717
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,280
wire

1718
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,200
i would highly recommend that you use

1719
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,960
braided wire so

1720
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,880
um the different types of wire you get

1721
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,880
like solid core and braided

1722
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,280
a solid core is as the name would

1723
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,079
suggest

1724
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,520
has a solid core um one single strand of

1725
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,240
wire

1726
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,119
and but braided has um lots of smaller

1727
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,640
pieces of wire

1728
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,240
braided together okay so solid core

1729
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,319
is solid um but basically braided wire

1730
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:19,839
allows you to do this so it's

1731
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:22,000
much more flexible okay so that

1732
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,440
flexibility

1733
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,079
um is is more convenient for us but it

1734
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,599
also means that when we're

1735
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,160
plugging and plugging these um these

1736
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,520
things that the

1737
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,520
it's got a little bit of flexibility so

1738
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,520
that it's not so brittle

1739
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,960
and the things with solid core wire

1740
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,000
um oh yeah so

1741
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,280
okay yeah thanks adam um so basically

1742
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,640
yeah you want you want to have

1743
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,720
a nice thin one my favorite actually is

1744
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,280
that adafruit silicon coated

1745
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,079
wire especially for um but that's kind

1746
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:54,480
of

1747
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,920
quite pricey for a project like this

1748
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,520
where you need like a really long

1749
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,359
piece of wire so yeah any kind of

1750
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,799
braided wire

1751
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:04,079
so you then would go on ahead and

1752
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:06,960
um join those two pieces of wire so so

1753
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,599
what i've done here

1754
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,480
is you join those two pieces of wire to

1755
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:12,799
the

1756
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:17,599
end of your um

1757
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,799
to the end of your piezo and

1758
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:23,439
um i've also put some heat shrink on on

1759
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:25,279
my soldered edge but basically yeah

1760
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,238
you what you want to do is is and take

1761
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:29,759
take the ends of this

1762
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,920
um when i'm joining two pieces of

1763
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,238
braided wire because this is braided

1764
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:37,600
um i um would normally um

1765
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:42,400
just wrap one around each other and then

1766
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,120
and then just to keep it stable in my in

1767
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,520
the grips of my crocodile clips

1768
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,120
um i will then um then tin

1769
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,359
one of the um pieces of braided wire and

1770
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,560
then heat it up while they're together

1771
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,158
so you're essentially

1772
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:59,120
it's mechanically connect so it's

1773
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,759
mechanically connected because you

1774
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:05,198
wrapped the two um ends of

1775
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:07,198
the wire around each other already but

1776
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:08,880
then you are

1777
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,880
just adding the glue right so it's never

1778
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,359
good to use solder as a structural

1779
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,839
piece of you know it's not structural

1780
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,120
integrity right where

1781
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,600
we're just using it as glue and for the

1782
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,759
two pieces of wire that are already

1783
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,080
wrapped around each other okay so you

1784
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,600
should always try and do

1785
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,000
and the mechanical mechanical with the

1786
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,880
wires

1787
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,479
and then you just just little double

1788
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,319
glue the solder should not be

1789
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,560
important to your the structure of your

1790
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,000
your wire bending

1791
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,479
and then i've put just to keep it neat

1792
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:40,000
um i have put

1793
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,198
um i've put um some

1794
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,158
heat shrink um around this which is just

1795
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:46,560
um

1796
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,600
plastic tube that you put on top and

1797
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,080
then you

1798
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,920
heat it up with a lighter and it wraps

1799
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,198
around you could just use

1800
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:55,199
electrical tape or anything that's going

1801
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:57,040
to stop the two

1802
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,600
bare pieces of wire from touching each

1803
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,239
other

1804
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:01,520
because if they do that we're going to

1805
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,520
have a short

1806
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,640
circuit in parallel what do you mean

1807
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,239
mike you're saying in parallel we're not

1808
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,320
we'll we're literally all we're doing is

1809
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,560
there's no there's no parallel or

1810
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,000
is this you just attaching one lead

1811
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,719
of your piezo to a wire and then

1812
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:21,440
attaching

1813
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,199
the other lead um to

1814
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,520
another wire so all we're doing is

1815
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,760
extending

1816
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,199
extending this so same lead on each one

1817
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:33,520
to

1818
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,320
red to red i mean

1819
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,080
i mean like i've just done two black

1820
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,600
wires because it doesn't matter which

1821
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,880
way range you put there

1822
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,640
which way round you connect it it's just

1823
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,080
that they have to be separate from each

1824
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,440
other like the red is just

1825
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,199
a wire color in this case it doesn't

1826
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:48,719
mean anything

1827
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:51,840
um but

1828
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,560
it's an unbalanced technology uh so i

1829
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,199
have

1830
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,360
matthew i haven't told you you're

1831
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,400
skipping ahead

1832
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,640
and i will tell you how to connect it to

1833
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,320
this it's just i don't have a sec

1834
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,480
um i just was showing you one i made

1835
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,480
earlier it's all good don't worry

1836
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,600
um so hopefully by now and i'm

1837
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,360
looking at some other people who are

1838
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,719
doing this that yes you

1839
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,960
and that it seems like this is about

1840
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,800
enough times you have been able to

1841
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,800
extend these long

1842
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,480
wires from our piezo disc

1843
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,000
um then depending again what you

1844
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,199
um what you bought and so you can either

1845
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,480
have a jacks

1846
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:34,000
or you can have so this is like the the

1847
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,920
male jack and then this would be the

1848
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,280
female jack it doesn't

1849
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,320
matter which which one you've got as

1850
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,400
long as we've got some way of

1851
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,120
plugging in the two wires this is the

1852
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,440
two wires from the piezo

1853
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,040
needs to have some way of plugging it

1854
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,800
into your amplifier

1855
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,440
whether you use an input jack like this

1856
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,120
and then use a normal guitar cable to

1857
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,560
plug it into

1858
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,880
works exactly the same as as one of

1859
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,560
these so i'm just going to show you

1860
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,880
um one of these things

1861
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,760
so this is just inside of the guitar

1862
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,239
cable this is a mono

1863
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,760
and what it has is it's got um

1864
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,679
two pieces of metal inside the guitar

1865
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:21,120
cable so guitar jack and you've got

1866
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,760
um one which is the ground this longer

1867
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,320
one here is the ground and on some

1868
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,960
piece on some different uh brands of

1869
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,400
guitar cable

1870
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,199
uh sorry guitar jacks you might not find

1871
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:33,600
you might

1872
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,080
find that the ground has not got a

1873
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,440
little hole to help you

1874
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,719
solder um which is okay you can you can

1875
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:41,040
make

1876
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,960
do with what wrapping the wire around

1877
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,640
and then like soldering soldering the

1878
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,600
whole thing kind of

1879
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,640
to itself but um i

1880
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,719
um i personally just prefer the ones

1881
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:51,679
with the holes because they look a

1882
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,040
little bit neater

1883
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,199
um but what you can do is um you can

1884
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:56,960
just make do with anything really so

1885
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,120
um yeah so then we've got one one on the

1886
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,480
inside here so this like

1887
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,520
this side here is attached to to one

1888
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,440
side of my piezo

1889
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,040
and then the other side here is attached

1890
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,760
to the other side of the piezo

1891
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,800
with a little bit of solder

1892
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,320
and if you have got one of these jacks

1893
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,640
it's a similar story um in that it has

1894
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,440
two little lugs with holes on them and

1895
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,080
then you connect one side of the piezo

1896
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,040
to one of these holes and the other side

1897
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,480
of the piezo

1898
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,400
to another one of these holes all right

1899
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,599
um so a couple of questions um

1900
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,199
so blah blah blah and find out the hard

1901
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:44,159
way

1902
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:45,840
that you need to put the sheath over the

1903
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,600
wire before soldering the one quarter

1904
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,320
inch jack

1905
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,560
i've done that so many times yes you do

1906
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,239
need to do that that's a good point

1907
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:55,360
um so when you

1908
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,159
when you solder on this your quarter

1909
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,480
inch as you americans call it to quarter

1910
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,679
inch

1911
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:04,640
jack and if you've not put on your

1912
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,920
little sheath

1913
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,000
before then you're not going to get it

1914
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,199
on afterwards

1915
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:12,239
it's just like um

1916
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:13,360
[Music]

1917
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,600
heat shrink wrapping you never remember

1918
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,840
to put it on before you sold it

1919
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,280
um before you sold it yeah um so

1920
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,520
yes that's fine i mean by the way it

1921
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,480
would still work

1922
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,080
without the sheath on it as well it

1923
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,920
might look a bit more hack then

1924
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,640
a little bit hackier but that's okay

1925
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,159
this is hackaday

1926
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,360
um so i have a soup can lid or a clear

1927
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,560
plastic disc

1928
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,679
about the same size oh nice nice size

1929
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,280
super candid is one preferred um

1930
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,120
oh yeah i reckon the soup can lid would

1931
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,800
be cooler and we chose

1932
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,360
plastic because it's um this is actually

1933
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,719
a project from the book

1934
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,800
that robin and i've been doing together

1935
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,000
um and

1936
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,880
um we it just looks it's easier to

1937
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,560
photograph isn't it so you can see

1938
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,600
everything here um so

1939
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,400
yeah um how long should the wires be so

1940
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,760
um the wires need to reach from wherever

1941
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,120
you're going to be singing

1942
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,880
um or making noises um to your amplifier

1943
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,719
like so mine is around like a meter and

1944
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,719
a half i think but

1945
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,960
you know it's it's fine like whatever

1946
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,719
yeah basically

1947
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,600
um and how long are the wires we're

1948
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,800
adding to the piezo we've already

1949
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,159
covered that

1950
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:33,679
have i seen this type of piezo

1951
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:36,880
with pads on them

1952
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,239
where's this have you are you

1953
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:43,120
showing me i am i can see bob hello bob

1954
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:43,840
um

1955
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,199
let me open up oh no i've never seen

1956
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:50,400
one of those types of piezo

1957
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,600
oh that's weird no no no

1958
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,960
let me unmute you hang on and me jonna

1959
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,120
and let me pin you let me pin you up why

1960
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,800
can't i mute you here you are

1961
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,760
oh i'm muted now i'm on youtube okay so

1962
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,440
there you are so you can show

1963
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,760
so you're a knife spotlighted bob what's

1964
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,480
up

1965
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,360
what are these what these piezos i don't

1966
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,199
know i found it in a drawer crash space

1967
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:13,920
and i thought hey

1968
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,560
i should try that i've never used one of

1969
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,199
those

1970
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:19,199
but i i did one and it's it's working

1971
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,040
it's interesting brushing my face

1972
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,440
that's really interesting um so i'm

1973
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,159
guessing

1974
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:27,360
i can't see i'm guessing the the crystal

1975
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,800
surface

1976
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,000
must be um not complete underneath the

1977
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,440
one of the sides

1978
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,360
oh yeah nice headphones bob they're

1979
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,760
really cool um yeah well if it's working

1980
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,520
great um i've just never

1981
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,719
never seen i've never seen those um

1982
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,960
but you know i do live on a different

1983
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,640
continent so

1984
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,600
um all right um yeah i mean i guess they

1985
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,840
were the same so piazza's with pads

1986
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,600
how long did you say blah blah blah just

1987
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,960
soldered one up great i

1988
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,040
think that a lot of people have um

1989
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:03,040
managed to um am i back on the screen

1990
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,560
then who you are

1991
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,719
so um a lot of people have managed to

1992
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,080
solder up

1993
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,760
their piezo on one end with the

1994
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,199
jack on the other this is great hooray

1995
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:19,840
um so now you've managed to solder

1996
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,400
the core part of your experiment and

1997
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,520
before you start making

1998
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,000
it into a microphone and which we're

1999
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,280
going to show you how to do now

2000
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,239
um or you know the embroidery hoop but

2001
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,679
you can

2002
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,400
use the same thing that you've done to

2003
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:34,800
um

2004
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,239
do any kind of like fine signed

2005
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:37,840
experiments that we're talking about

2006
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,960
before

2007
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,280
um around the through the water or

2008
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,239
through whatever

2009
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,679
um but to make it into a microphone what

2010
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:47,440
we're doing is we're adding a

2011
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,880
um a circle here um to

2012
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,560
um oh yeah

2013
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,480
yeah so we're adding a circle here which

2014
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,719
we're then gonna suspend with an

2015
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,760
embroidery hoop um which is going to

2016
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,480
then act as a resonator so it's going to

2017
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,120
pick up

2018
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,760
the sounds from our voice a little bit

2019
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,560
more

2020
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,239
and also it's just going to look really

2021
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:11,960
cool it looks like one of those like old

2022
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,120
1940s

2023
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,159
radio microphones i think so

2024
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:18,719
the the thing that i've done here is and

2025
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:20,960
so you've taken this yogurt pot lid

2026
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,480
or or tin can or lid or

2027
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,679
whatever it is that you've got and we're

2028
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:27,520
gonna you need to prepare

2029
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,239
the plastic disc or whatever disc it is

2030
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,159
that you've got

2031
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:35,600
so um i just use a scalpel tube sorry

2032
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,560
um i just use a scalpel to cut off the

2033
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,199
raised edges of a yoga pop lid but you

2034
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:43,440
can use anything you can scavenge as

2035
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:43,840
long

2036
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,480
as the plastic isn't too flimsy tin

2037
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,880
would probably work really well as well

2038
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,000
um but whatever you are using

2039
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,480
um is as you need to place your piezo in

2040
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,239
the center of your disk

2041
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:59,760
and then use a pen without sticking it

2042
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,880
down just use a pen

2043
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,920
to mark a couple of holes for strain

2044
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,960
relief

2045
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,400
and so this is what i've done here and

2046
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,239
this is like this is a great tip just

2047
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:09,280
generally if you're

2048
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,880
if you're doing anything with um

2049
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,199
electronics that is quite flimsy like

2050
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:13,600
this

2051
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,840
is as i say like it's quite difficult

2052
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,840
like it's really easy to like

2053
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,080
um for these soldering joints to come

2054
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,600
off so what i've done

2055
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,480
is i have marked before i've drilled it

2056
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,199
now but

2057
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:27,840
i've marked three spots to provide

2058
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,800
mechanical strain relief so that when my

2059
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,760
wire is moving around or like the

2060
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,520
microphone is moving around

2061
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,560
and any of that friction that movement

2062
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:38,880
is

2063
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,600
is being stopped at these points right

2064
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,360
so by the time it gets to here it's

2065
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,280
super stable right so that's like that

2066
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,719
mechanical

2067
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:50,159
strain relief and what i did here is

2068
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:51,040
like when it was uh

2069
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,560
so you basically place you place your

2070
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,520
disc or your pso on your desk then you

2071
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,080
mark

2072
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,400
two holes is fine i just did three i

2073
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,080
can't remember why but i did

2074
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,600
um and then when you've marked those

2075
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,159
take the piezo back off again and then

2076
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:05,040
just

2077
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,840
because this is quite a thin plastic oh

2078
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,400
i used

2079
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,480
um just a drill to do this because it

2080
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,840
was on my workbench anyway but you can

2081
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,280
also just like bash through it with a

2082
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,159
skewer

2083
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:18,000
or you know like a knife or whatever

2084
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,920
you've got like it's a piece of plastic

2085
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,679
you can make a hole in it without

2086
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:23,920
professional equipment but yeah so

2087
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,520
that's actually a very important step is

2088
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,080
to

2089
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,440
make and sure that your um

2090
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,800
plastic and or tin disc has

2091
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,920
at least one um

2092
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,679
method of mechanical um

2093
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,800
strain relief so and once you

2094
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,440
have um oh you also it's important there

2095
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,320
is to remove

2096
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,480
any rough edges especially if you're

2097
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,440
using

2098
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,199
um especially if you're using um

2099
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:56,560
metal um obviously metal edges

2100
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,000
and plus the soft little plastic coating

2101
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,040
on your wire and they're going to have a

2102
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,800
pretty bad time together

2103
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,840
so just make sure that um any

2104
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,960
holes that you make in your resonator

2105
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,000
circle um eyes nice and smooth

2106
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,239
nice and smooth out so that you don't

2107
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,560
cut your wires on them or cause it

2108
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,239
you know like a terrible short circuit

2109
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,080
or something um

2110
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,760
so yeah once you've got your holes

2111
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,400
marked just drill them out

2112
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,480
um and i guess you know what

2113
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,760
we should have threaded it through

2114
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,040
before we soldered this on

2115
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:38,880
oh well um so that was

2116
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,280
we'll put that in the show notes um

2117
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,320
because obviously you're gonna need to

2118
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,000
thread it through

2119
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,040
um well anyway

2120
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,080
sorry about that um yeah so you can

2121
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,040
either

2122
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,280
not bother with the mechanical holes um

2123
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,719
or actually you could just poke them

2124
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:56,400
through and like stellar tape it on the

2125
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,480
other side if you've already done this

2126
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,080
everyone you know you're soldering or

2127
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,520
you can just like um

2128
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,320
re-solder your jack once you've threaded

2129
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:04,960
your

2130
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,560
um threaded jaw wires through

2131
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,000
so yeah basically when you put your

2132
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,320
holes you thread your wires through

2133
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,600
and add this back on um

2134
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,960
and then you've got yourself um oh yeah

2135
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,560
and that's i should say also you need to

2136
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,120
stick

2137
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,120
your piece so it's threaded through you

2138
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,960
need to stick your piezo onto your

2139
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,360
plastic lid okay

2140
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,560
um and the way that you do that um

2141
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:33,360
is i'm just using a piece just like a

2142
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,639
one piece of

2143
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:38,000
um sticky tape like sellotape um i think

2144
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,880
a flat piece the important thing is it's

2145
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,320
stuck down on

2146
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,280
this side right so the face of your

2147
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,120
piezo

2148
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,280
um which is where the wires are the face

2149
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,159
of your piezo

2150
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:53,520
needs to be on in contact with your

2151
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,719
resonator

2152
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,840
disc okay and you'll still get a sign

2153
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,120
the other way around but just won't

2154
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,880
be good like

2155
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,040
um yeah so you need to stick it down

2156
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,080
face down on your disc

2157
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,280
um nice and secure there

2158
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:17,760
um yeah so there's that bit there

2159
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,840
soldering there we go

2160
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,120
um i mean i don't think there's much

2161
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,639
more to explain about how to

2162
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,120
stick a piezo onto a piece of plastic

2163
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:29,920
just as long

2164
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,080
as um yeah it's the side that you've

2165
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,000
soldered right

2166
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,840
um so the adhesion mat up so it's fine

2167
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,840
yeah so basically what you're doing is

2168
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,000
you are using a piece of sticky tape

2169
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,040
um to um stick

2170
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,719
your piezo piezo side

2171
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:53,040
down onto your piece of plastic okay

2172
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,600
it doesn't i mean i would put it right

2173
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,560
in the center

2174
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,880
yes um because that's going to get the

2175
01:23:58,880 --> 01:23:59,600
best

2176
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,840
resonance um

2177
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,159
yeah yeah so basically this is just held

2178
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:10,159
on by a piece of sticky tape

2179
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:12,320
and it's stuck down on this side so the

2180
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,199
sticky tape is

2181
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:16,480
here okay so the

2182
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,719
the the piazza that's the important

2183
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,880
thing is to stick that down

2184
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,719
on the resonator in the middle

2185
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,960
yeah yeah that's a good point and all

2186
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,960
that that's there so the sticky tape

2187
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,000
here i've used quite a

2188
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,920
wide piece of sticky tape because we

2189
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,320
want all of the edges nice and securely

2190
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,280
stuck down

2191
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:39,199
so basically the more contact your piezo

2192
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:43,440
or contact mic has with your resonator

2193
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,360
the better result that you're gonna have

2194
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,679
okay again you know it's still a hacky

2195
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,360
microphone so don't obsess over these

2196
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,280
things but like the more you can get it

2197
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,000
to stick

2198
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,600
down and the better it's gonna have

2199
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,480
if my thing is already a circle that has

2200
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,800
a lip is that okay or remove the lip i

2201
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,199
would

2202
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:04,560
remove that lip um partially because

2203
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:05,840
we're gonna have to

2204
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,719
um clamp it on using our binder clips in

2205
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:09,600
a minute

2206
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,120
so all right

2207
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,800
so um i'll give you a little minute as

2208
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,920
a few of you who are doing this live um

2209
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,360
and are catching up

2210
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,639
but i think um quite a few of you

2211
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:30,000
have managed to get to

2212
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,320
um the soldering and sticking phase

2213
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,040
which is great

2214
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,600
so i don't have any questions so far or

2215
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,639
are we

2216
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:39,679
are we all on board with um

2217
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:43,199
with this attach attach this to a piece

2218
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:44,480
of

2219
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,440
thing add some mechanical relief and

2220
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,679
then attach the other end

2221
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:54,560
to the um to your jack

2222
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,719
is this the right side let me let me try

2223
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:59,360
and find your um

2224
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,360
where are you here you are i find you

2225
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,639
hang on one second

2226
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,719
let me open it um that hello

2227
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,600
um that looks right so how is that stuck

2228
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,239
dying

2229
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:13,679
onto you i'm gonna unmute you

2230
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:17,040
um it's double-sided tape

2231
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,920
is this is it am i seeing through

2232
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:20,560
something

2233
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,480
no so that's the that's the one that's

2234
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,719
the wrong side that it's stuck on to

2235
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,000
so the double-sided state tape um

2236
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,080
so basically your um your piazzo this

2237
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,400
this like the the white the bit with the

2238
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,520
wire on it

2239
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,639
that should be connected to your

2240
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,920
resonator so face down so the more

2241
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:45,040
face so basically is this this is the

2242
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,960
uh this is the wrong wrong side

2243
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,520
essentially so this is where the tape is

2244
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,960
and then this side um so basically it's

2245
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,480
the opposite to what you've done

2246
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,679
so if you just flick your flipper upside

2247
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:58,239
down

2248
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,880
i'm excited to hear your tin lid though

2249
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:01,280
um

2250
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:05,600
and then oh what just happened

2251
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,000
you just magic squares i didn't mind it

2252
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,159
square right

2253
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:14,960
okay all right

2254
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,320
so sean said so which bit white bit is

2255
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,400
face down to the plastic yes

2256
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,440
um and then charlene i'm gonna scroll

2257
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,520
through and find you

2258
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,800
let's have a look let's have a look

2259
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,960
yes that looks perfect

2260
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,280
very nice and that's so you've stuck it

2261
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,120
down hello

2262
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,679
so you stuck it down on that side

2263
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:40,320
perfect

2264
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,440
that's exactly correct um you get an a

2265
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,920
plus um that's amazing can i have a look

2266
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,280
at the other side again

2267
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:50,080
look at that that's looking tight i know

2268
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,719
and you've got it all ready

2269
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:54,719
and you've got the sheets on wow look at

2270
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:56,159
this nice

2271
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,960
okay that's perfect well done good job

2272
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,600
everybody good job well done all right

2273
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,960
so um

2274
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,960
so it looks like when i'm ready then to

2275
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,800
move on to the next

2276
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,320
step um

2277
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,719
so we have um this is actually the most

2278
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:16,880
difficult but it's just tying elastic

2279
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,080
correctly um let me just

2280
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,840
so what we're doing with this let me

2281
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:29,199
just get this out of the way

2282
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:32,239
here we go so

2283
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,679
we are now ready to move on to

2284
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:38,800
the creation of the embroidery hoop part

2285
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,920
of it so you're gonna need to get your

2286
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,760
embroidery hoop and you're gonna need to

2287
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,440
so you should have an embroidery hoop

2288
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,560
and eight

2289
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,520
binder clips builder clips whatever you

2290
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,400
call them

2291
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,239
um little paper clips essentially so

2292
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:53,679
what i'm doing here

2293
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:56,719
is i've got my four large

2294
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:00,000
paper binder clips and i've put them

2295
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,760
at quarters around so this is the top

2296
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,080
and then i've put that just placed them

2297
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,679
at four quarters

2298
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,120
around here i'm actually going to do it

2299
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,360
with you 10 22

2300
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,800
yeah 20 past seven 22

2301
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,840
20 plus seven exactly yeah so four four

2302
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:18,639
quarters

2303
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:21,040
so i'm gonna share the pain i'm gonna

2304
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:21,760
snip this

2305
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,440
off because i'll do it with you and

2306
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,480
do one side with you

2307
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,920
so um so you should have then once you

2308
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,760
clicked on your four binder clips

2309
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,679
um you should then have we're then gonna

2310
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:36,880
clip on we're gonna

2311
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,679
then attach the four mini binder clips

2312
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:41,760
using elastic and the four mini binder

2313
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,360
clips are what are going to clip

2314
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,400
on to our um uh

2315
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,400
it's going to hold our piezo in place

2316
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,920
but it's going to be um

2317
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,800
held in place and in between this so

2318
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,320
what we do is you're going to take

2319
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:58,000
your elastic i've got some elastic cord

2320
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,320
you could also use elastic

2321
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:07,840
bands or this whatever

2322
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,280
good and there's quite a lot of people

2323
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,080
who seem to

2324
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,000
have been making it work that's really

2325
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,120
awesome i'm really happy

2326
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,639
that it's working for so many of you

2327
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:18,639
that's really really cool

2328
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:20,480
um so what we're going to do this is

2329
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,840
just some elastic cord you can use

2330
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,520
whatever elastic you've got

2331
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,080
and just snip off a little bit and so

2332
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,199
i've got

2333
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:30,080
what's this like 20 centimeters we're

2334
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,520
going to be adjusting this so don't

2335
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,719
imagine that you're gonna

2336
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:35,040
um so this will take a little a little

2337
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,239
while to get right

2338
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:39,040
so what you do is you're gonna take your

2339
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,080
elastic

2340
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,480
um and you're gonna push thread it

2341
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,440
through

2342
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,480
one bit of your binder clip right

2343
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,679
like this so ignore that here we are so

2344
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,679
basically it's gone through the end with

2345
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,360
the binder clip a little bit of elastic

2346
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,320
here

2347
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,639
um and then what i'm going to do is take

2348
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,960
my mini binder clip

2349
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,600
and i'm going to just stand up so you

2350
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:02,000
can actually

2351
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,520
see me do it um i'm going to

2352
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,560
um thread it through the

2353
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,320
um the um

2354
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:16,000
arm of the little binder clip

2355
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,679
so it's like they're both on the same

2356
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:19,520
piece of elastic right so you've got the

2357
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,280
big binder clip

2358
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,760
um which has got the elastic looped

2359
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:24,480
through it

2360
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,920
and then you've got the little binder

2361
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,840
clip which is also

2362
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,199
looped through and then what i'm just

2363
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:30,960
gonna do is just tie

2364
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,080
a knot in the elastic okay

2365
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,280
so you've got this uh

2366
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,639
essentially just a loop a loose

2367
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:43,760
a loose loop um of

2368
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,920
the one going through the arm of the big

2369
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,600
binder clip and then going through the

2370
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,520
arm of the little binder clip

2371
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,760
all right then what you're going to do

2372
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,159
is take another piece

2373
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:58,080
of elastic

2374
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,440
it's like another piece of elastic and

2375
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,440
i'm not being precious about the tying

2376
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,400
of the knot because

2377
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:03,520
the thing is like you're going to have

2378
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,920
to tie and re-tie this several times in

2379
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,840
order to be able to get the correct

2380
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,840
thing so then you're going to take so

2381
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,440
this is looped on here

2382
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,679
hooray um i should have worn a light

2383
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:14,960
color top so you could see

2384
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,199
everything um and then we're going to do

2385
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:18,560
the same for the next

2386
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,760
for the next side so we're going to loop

2387
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:26,239
loop this next binder ring arm over

2388
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:30,159
e so basically the next one over same

2389
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:30,960
again

2390
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,280
and then we're going to do then we're

2391
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,280
going to use that

2392
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,199
we're going to loop it onto the same

2393
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:40,080
loop of this of the mini

2394
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,360
of the mini binder clip okay so i'm just

2395
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,639
going to tie that up and i'll show you

2396
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:46,880
what i've done

2397
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,000
so you should now have

2398
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:52,000
[Music]

2399
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,120
and i have a fairly deformed looking

2400
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,320
two loops here we are so

2401
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,040
there this little mini binder clip is

2402
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,320
attached

2403
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,639
to this one and then to this one so

2404
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:06,239
there's like a little elastic

2405
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:09,440
cord bridge and you want to do the same

2406
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,320
thing and we'll we'll tighten it up in a

2407
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,000
minute but that's that's basically one

2408
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,760
done you want to do the same thing all

2409
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,719
the way around

2410
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:19,920
okay so here we have here's one i

2411
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,520
prepared earlier

2412
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,960
um here is exactly the same thing so the

2413
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,040
two big binder clips are holding in

2414
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,920
suspension a mini binder clip

2415
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,639
there's another one same like that and

2416
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,080
the same like this one and here's the

2417
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,679
one i just did yours is going to look a

2418
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,199
bit more like this because it's a little

2419
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:38,239
bit flabby

2420
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,080
and so what we're going to need to do is

2421
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:43,440
make sure so once it's all attached

2422
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:46,320
you can just spend some time taunting

2423
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,880
your elastic right so i'm like okay well

2424
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,560
this is this is too tall so i'm just

2425
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,560
gonna have to snip

2426
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:55,120
i'm just gonna snip this and re-tie it

2427
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,040
to somewhere where i think it's gonna

2428
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,760
have a little bit more torchness so i'm

2429
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,120
gonna do that now and then you do on the

2430
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,719
other side so

2431
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:04,639
this normally takes like a little minute

2432
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,800
to just make sure that your elastics are

2433
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:07,199
all

2434
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:08,800
kind of sitting the way that you want

2435
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,520
them to sit and but once you've

2436
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,760
got them all nice and taut you're pretty

2437
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,120
much ready

2438
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,600
so i'll give you i'll just um i'll do

2439
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,199
this one here but i'll also give you a

2440
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:20,880
little bit of

2441
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:24,480
time to work on your elastic

2442
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:27,360
elastic stuff

2443
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,760
and you'll see here now like again so

2444
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,280
that's looking a little bit better but

2445
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,040
you can also see that

2446
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,440
this side is much longer than this side

2447
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,760
so i've just re-trimmed this one

2448
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,199
so i'm going to spend some time

2449
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:45,040
uh i'm going to cut a little bit off of

2450
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,040
this one there so all i'm doing

2451
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,159
is um

2452
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:53,840
snipping and snipping

2453
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:57,199
the knot off and then re-tying the knot

2454
01:34:57,199 --> 01:35:00,960
is all i'm doing so some questions

2455
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,719
curious if bulldog clips are

2456
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:04,159
mechanically critical

2457
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:06,000
or holes around the edge of the circle

2458
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,280
would work

2459
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,199
um well as long as there's something

2460
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:10,480
suspending it

2461
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:13,199
so basically it just like the holes

2462
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:16,320
around the edge of the circle

2463
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,239
would also work but the thing is if it's

2464
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,880
if if it's around the edge of the circle

2465
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,639
and so this is actually um not connect

2466
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:28,000
so this is like um the critical

2467
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,280
thing is the this needs to be kind of

2468
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,040
suspended so that if you

2469
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,040
hit this there's some kind of shock

2470
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,600
absorption as well

2471
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:40,400
um but yeah actually the original

2472
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,560
version of this we were doing it with um

2473
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,840
one of those loom circles

2474
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,679
um which you know works fine as well but

2475
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:48,880
like i just think this one

2476
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,880
looks cooler it kind of reminds me of

2477
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:55,360
the 1940s radio mic so it's stronger

2478
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,719
yeah and you're only going through

2479
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:02,639
one arm of each clip yep

2480
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,639
yeah so um one arm

2481
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:10,400
so each clip only goes through one arm

2482
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,119
and but that one arm on each clip will

2483
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:14,080
be attached

2484
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,639
to we'll have two pieces of elastic

2485
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:17,119
right

2486
01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:19,280
so the big bulldog clips will each have

2487
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,040
two pieces of elastic

2488
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,360
on each side i'll show you what it looks

2489
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:24,480
like in a minute

2490
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,600
going to a small two different small

2491
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,040
clips um and then

2492
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,320
each small clip

2493
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:38,080
similarly will go so here we are um

2494
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,920
so again here we are this this is me

2495
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,840
kind of tying and re-tying

2496
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,480
i'm going to try and add i'm going to

2497
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:45,119
try and

2498
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:46,960
reduce this a little bit now but yeah

2499
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,320
it's just a question of tying and

2500
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:48,960
re-tying

2501
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,320
all the elastic do you think non-elastic

2502
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,280
string could work

2503
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:56,560
if it's taut enough probably

2504
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,320
i don't know you know i used on mine

2505
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,480
what did you use the jewelry

2506
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,360
the clear jewelry elastic stuff so it's

2507
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:03,840
not as

2508
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,400
elasticy but it's got a little bit of

2509
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,199
bend to it yeah that works really nicely

2510
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:12,639
yes so um rob you probably all just

2511
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:15,040
heard that but robin has used um like

2512
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:15,440
the

2513
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,760
elasti not elastic but it's like a

2514
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,400
little bit of give yeah

2515
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,360
so you could even like use um yeah you

2516
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:24,639
could use anything as long as it's got a

2517
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:25,600
little bit of give

2518
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,320
to make sure it's nice and taut yeah if

2519
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,119
there are rubber bands the right size

2520
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:33,280
yeah yeah we could use the right size

2521
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,760
rubber bands as well

2522
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:39,040
um snapping with the bands yeah yeah but

2523
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,800
yeah exactly they'd be a bit more

2524
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,119
brittle so this is getting there

2525
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:45,440
i need to reduce this a little bit more

2526
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,480
as you can see

2527
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,719
as you can see like so this this is not

2528
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:50,960
in the middle so we need to make sure

2529
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,480
this is the bit that takes the longest

2530
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,639
time right it's making sure that

2531
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:58,000
these are approximately gonna hold your

2532
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,360
ring in the center okay um

2533
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,560
but again like i'm just going to show

2534
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:03,840
you because in case this is like

2535
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,040
sometimes that people get a little bit

2536
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,800
confused so you've got

2537
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,639
one binder clip um

2538
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:12,800
with one arm of the binder clip the

2539
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,679
large binder clip goes to this

2540
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:18,800
small one and this small one and ditto

2541
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:19,360
so you've got

2542
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,840
four mini binder clips held in

2543
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:22,800
suspension

2544
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,239
by four maxi binder clips all right

2545
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:28,400
i'm just gonna finish off this bit of

2546
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,840
string and then i'll show you how to

2547
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,760
hook it up how is everybody's string

2548
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:35,199
going um it just takes it takes a little

2549
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:36,960
bit of trial and error to get this

2550
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,480
um to get this bit right just a little

2551
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,400
bit of snipping and retying to make sure

2552
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,520
it's nice and

2553
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:48,480
and even yeah

2554
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:55,440
i've got a miley cyrus song in my head

2555
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,000
it's driving me crazy

2556
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,440
no it's um party in the usa terrible

2557

01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:13,840
what you call it go

2561
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,679
uh yeah

2562
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:20,560
all right so let's snip these off this

2563
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,280
looks about right

2564
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:28,639

01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:55,840
um so when you are plugging in your

2651
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:56,719
microphone

2652
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:59,119
um don't make sure that the both volume

2653
01:43:59,119 --> 01:43:59,840
and the gain

2654
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,880
are turned right yes

2655
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:06,960
right right right down down down

2656
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:16,400
also guys it's an unbalanced signal

2657
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,390
it's an unbalanced signal

2658
01:44:19,390 --> 01:44:21,199
[Laughter]

2659
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:24,159
sorry stop it

2660
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:27,360
um base basically you don't have you

2661
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,199
don't have your three different points

2662
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:32,880
um um all neatly uh being wide and with

2663
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,639
a align like polarity um so basically

2664
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:38,880
you've got a lot of signal going in and

2665
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,800
it's not balanced so basically

2666
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,440
start your gain off really really low

2667
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,880
and your volume

2668
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:48,000
or else you are going to

2669
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,280
um waste your monitors or your speakers

2670
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:52,560
or what have you and even if they're

2671
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,480
really cheap it's just not worth it

2672
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,719
and also it's really crap to listen to

2673
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:58,159
on the ears

2674
01:44:58,159 --> 01:45:01,520
um yeah all right cool so that's that's

2675
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:02,800
the make um

2676
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,040
we've got a couple of minutes left so if

2677
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:05,920
you've got any

2678
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:10,000
questions about this please slam them in

2679
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,239
um but we're also gonna spend a couple

2680
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:14,159
of seconds talking to you back

2681
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:17,679
yes this is the um it's very quick make

2682
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:19,760
and it's an accompanying mate to this

2683
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,360
at this time there's no sense yeah just

2684
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,839
turn it down

2685
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,360
um it's pretty loud though huh it's a

2686
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,800
pretty cool little microphone it sounds

2687
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,159
quite nice

2688
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:32,560
i really like it i've i actually this is

2689
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,760
this is no joke

2690
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,080
i've actually done um some vocal

2691
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,760
recording on a couple of tracks using

2692
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:38,719
this microphone

2693
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:41,119
really yeah it's to be honest with you

2694
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:43,440
people pay a lot of money to do lo-fi

2695
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,280
recordings and this has a really

2696
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,719
beautiful

2697
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:50,000
low-fi um result um

2698
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,239
and if you do use a little bit of echo

2699
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:53,600
and a little bit of reverb

2700
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,639
it's just beautiful and you can also use

2701
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:58,639
it to actually pick up sounds from

2702
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:01,360
instruments not just your voice um and

2703
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,199
it also does really really uh cool

2704
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:04,159
pickups um

2705
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:05,920
for those as well and it's good for

2706
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,600
at-home recording

2707
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,600
it is it's a great little great little

2708
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,040
microphone i was very happy when it

2709
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:11,679
worked

2710
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:13,440
um i'm going to spend a couple of

2711
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,360
seconds talking about this this is the

2712
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,480
um the accompanying pop shield and so

2713
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:19,520
all this is

2714
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,880
um is another embroidery hoop

2715
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:26,080
um that i have um unscrewed

2716
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:28,480
and then on the inside i just put the

2717
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,360
toe of

2718
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:32,800
a pair of tights um onto it and then

2719
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,520
just tied

2720
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,840
a little a little knot at either end you

2721
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,199
can't really see that because it's so

2722
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:38,719
dark but essentially it's just

2723
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:41,840
some tights tied over a piece of um

2724
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,679
the inside ring of an embroidery hoop

2725
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,360
and then you put it back in

2726
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:48,960
and what a pop shield does um is

2727
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:52,159
it stops um all the sibilance so like

2728
01:46:52,159 --> 01:46:52,840
when you

2729
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,840
um when you speak into

2730
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,840
or sing into a microphone some of the

2731
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,040
words that some of the

2732
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:02,080
sounds that you say um create like a a

2733
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:02,480
pop

2734
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:05,760
effect like the the like a p is a really

2735
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:06,880
good one so p

2736
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,800
and it'll go it'll make this horrible

2737
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,480
sound um and this will

2738
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:11,600
kind of stop it i should have got you to

2739
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,040
explain that because like your knowledge

2740
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,600
of this is much more than mine

2741
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,199
that's the actual audio producer but you

2742
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:18,639
nailed it yeah

2743
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:22,159
i did it that's my uh that's my amateur

2744
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:24,800
knowledge of what a pop shield is

2745
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:28,159
at the end of the day you know um

2746
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:31,119
it helps you especially with microphones

2747
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:31,920
like this

2748
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,480
and with condenser microphones

2749
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:36,000
especially like this one

2750
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,040
here this is a condenser microphone all

2751
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,080
right with its own

2752
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,080
shield with a prep shield so condenser

2753
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:44,159
microphones come with pop shields why

2754
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:46,400
is because we use condenser microphones

2755
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,679
to pick up

2756
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:50,800
uh lower signals all right so

2757
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,000
um good work everyone wow i'm seeing

2758
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,840
lots of people waving their microphones

2759
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,040
at me this is really awesome i'm going

2760
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,480
to show you charlie and let me

2761
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:00,480
take you to charlene charlene here we

2762
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,639
are oh beautiful oh wow

2763
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,080
it's so nice i love the yellow flash

2764
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,639
does it work

2765
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:11,280
does it work i'm gonna i'm gonna end me

2766
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:12,719
i i

2767
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:16,840
didn't buy batteries for this guy

2768
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:19,840
so

2769
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:29,040
one of those but it doesn't turn on so

2770
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,199
and yeah i'm going to use them with that

2771
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:32,480
have you got the type that has got a

2772
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:32,880
little

2773
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,280
handy belt clip on it if you look at the

2774
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:37,040
back of your amp it's got a little belt

2775
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:37,360
clip

2776
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:41,199
there those these little amplifiers

2777
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:44,000
are you see them everywhere in sound

2778
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:44,800
hacking

2779
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,560
circles because they are the cheapest

2780
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,840
nastiest

2781
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:49,520
little portable amplifiers you can get

2782
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,400
and i just think it's a little

2783
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,520
marshmallow

2784
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,199
yeah yeah yeah but those ones are like

2785
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:55,520
12 euros yeah no no these ones are like

2786
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:56,800
12. they're so great

2787
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:00,800
and i love the belt clip hilarious

2788
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,840
yeah absolutely

2789
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,760
love it good job i'm gonna i think

2790
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,040
there's quite a few people who've

2791
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,280
um who have made them i'm gonna skip on

2792
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:12,080
to you thanks for showing oh look here

2793
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:14,719
floor with your beautiful zoom

2794
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:15,360
background

2795
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,920
very atmospheric yeah you win yeah yeah

2796
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,199
it has

2797
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:20,639
i like it and you've tied it up with

2798
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:22,400
piece of ribbon as well

2799
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:26,559
nice that looks great is it working

2800
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:29,599
yeah it's actually old stocking uh that

2801
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:32,320
i cut up into this

2802
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:33,920
i don't have any rubber bands i'm gonna

2803
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,760
test it out

2804
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:38,719
yeah life

2805
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,199
yeah david yours will require quite a

2806
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:42,719
lot it will require quite a decent

2807
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:44,560
amount

2808
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,400
you need to like just increase the

2809
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:51,440
yeah i know i feel like we're putting

2810
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,199
you on the spot here

2811
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:54,560
so mine's not using that much

2812
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,080
amplification just because i'm putting

2813
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:56,639
it through

2814
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:58,800
my proper marshall guitar round like

2815
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,040
it's a proper guitar app so it's down

2816
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,119
quite low but with the cheaper

2817
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:05,280
amps you're going to need it's

2818
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,280
essentially taking some very small

2819
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:09,520
electric signals and turning them into

2820
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,280
signs so you are going to need to

2821
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:14,239
whack up that that sound i'm kevin yeah

2822
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:15,040
again

2823
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:18,159
staging it game stage before before

2824
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:20,719
before you're up in the volume yeah if

2825
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:21,599
you can

2826
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:24,080
that's great um did you manage to make

2827
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:25,679
you made it made a noise

2828
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:29,040
right flow yeah

2829
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,360
it it's working but uh it's just very

2830
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:32,639
loud there's a lot of feedback so i

2831
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:33,599
don't know

2832
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:35,280
you have to play play with the game

2833
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,880
settings before you play

2834
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,679
volume um yeah it's just a question of

2835
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:40,960
of playing with the different

2836
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,400
and playing with the game playing with

2837
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,000
the amplitude and then

2838
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,239
moving away from the speed yeah yeah

2839
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:47,760
that's true

2840
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,520
yeah if there's a lot of if there's a

2841
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:51,199
lot of feedback

2842
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:52,800
and let's put me here so if there's a

2843
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,719
lot of feedback you also might want to

2844
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:55,280
try

2845
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:58,000
moving your microphone away from your

2846
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,080
amplifier

2847
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:03,599
um i guess that that was um

2848
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:07,119
pre-gain max yeah so basically um

2849
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:09,040
yeah and you move your microphone away

2850
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,320
from your amplifier if you're getting

2851
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,360
quite a lot of feedback

2852
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:14,800
um but uh yeah that's awesome so

2853
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:18,000
um it's 22.59 here

2854
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,520
in berlin it is 11 o'clock almost

2855
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,960
um i hope you all have um

2856
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,040
had some fun um learning about how to

2857
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,199
make some noise with piezos and electric

2858
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:32,639
um magnetic pickups and so on um

2859
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:35,840
there's um i would recommend um where is

2860
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:36,800
it

2861
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,520

you're interested in this kind of thing

2863
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,040
um called handmade electronic music by a

2864
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,800
guy called nicholas collins

2865
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,560
and that's a really great one and this

2866
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:48,480
is pure electronics

2867
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:51,599
stuff this is a lovely one um and oh

2868

a lot about different types of

2893
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,280
microcontrollers but there are some um

2894
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,440
analog makes in there

2895
