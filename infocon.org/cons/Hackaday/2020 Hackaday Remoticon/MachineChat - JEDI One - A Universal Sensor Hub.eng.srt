59
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
i know last year i missed it but

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,520
i had like three or four straight years

61
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,440
of workshops so it's

62
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,239
awesome to be back so today we're gonna

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,440
have a little fun

64
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,280
um hopefully everyone's got your

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,160
hardware um

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,000
we actually shipped um two different

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,599
boards to customers so we have the

68
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,599
sparkfun esp32

69
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,000
but some people got the the adafruit

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,200
hazard board

71
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,720
for this demonstration today they're

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,800
going to be exactly the same so

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,640
don't worry if you got if this camera

74
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,959
shows red and you got the black one so

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,000
no issues so i hope everyone has

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680
their solder station fired up and

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
warming up so

78
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
before we dive into that i'll bring up

79
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,160
the fun little

80
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,840
spreadsheet so share

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,159
so i put this link in the chat window

82
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,920
all the files for today will be easy to

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,760
find i even put a link

84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,480
to document here for helping and find

85
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,120
some of the other documents

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,879
but yeah we'll just kind of start with

87
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,720
the presentation for today

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
we are going to be using an awesome tool

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
called jedi one it's from a company

90
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,159
called machine chat

91
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,200
they're ex-elentronics guys and they're

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,400
it's an awesome iot application so

93
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,560
bring up a nice little slide it is a

94
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
binary that can run on windows

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,120
mac or linux and you can also run on the

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,280
raspberry pi or the beaglebone

97
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,959
for today we're going to spend a lot of

98
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,040
time with the raspberry pi 4

99
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,239
but this also works great on the

100
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,239
raspberry pi 3. i haven't tried the

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,200
zeros but i'm

102
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,840
sure it works but it's an awesome

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,560
dashboard

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,879
for connecting sensors so for today

105
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,360
we're gonna do some soldering so

106
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,239
everyone got this

107
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,599
dallas one wire sensor

108
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,439
we're gonna cut about two inches from it

109
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,239
so we're gonna actually switch this this

110
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,120
presentation

111
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,159
is available on through emoticon it is

112
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,200
right here

113
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,480
i'll just bring it up real quick

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,040
and i'll just actually link this in the

115
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,480
chat so stop the share

116
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,720
and throw it in the chat and with a

117
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,238
couple questions about recording um it

118
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,620
is being recorded so

119
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,759
[Music]

120
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
so we're going to switch back to the

121
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,840
soldercam and i'm going to try go full

122
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,040
screen with this

123
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,400
so you all get to watch me

124
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,460
solder live

125
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,159
[Music]

126
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,840
and then share and then you're going to

127
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,199
play if the switch's camera still get

128
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,840
the right one

129
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,240
there we go we're live and that one

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,840
changes so perfect

131
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,080
so we're going to be soldering now guys

132
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,960
so we

133
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,840
first grabbed the little connector for

134
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,759
the dallas one wire and

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,600
a nice little crimper and we're just

136
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:11,840
going to cut two inches from it

137
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,840
so you should have about yay

138
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,919
i should mention if you have any

139
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,360
questions please type them in the

140
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,080
workshop

141
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,160
so i'll split the wires in two so we're

142
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,600
gonna stick the white one on the one

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,720
side

144
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,039
and the black and red on the other this

145
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,240
is just going to help support them

146
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,600
then we're going to take the little

147
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,160
resistor the 2.7 i'm sorry in a lot of

148
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
the docs it said 4.7

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,280
that was a little typo but at least the

150
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,360
part number was correct so this is going

151
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,000
to go between

152
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,960
3.3 and pin number 13 which is right

153
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,759
here

154
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,639
now on the adafruit board it does say

155
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,280
13.

156
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,639
it's it's also called a12 but it is

157
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:04,960
still

158
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,720
13. so we're just going to connect those

159
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,479
two 3.3

160
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,840
so kind of bend them up a little bit so

161
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
it'll stay

162
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,720
and then we want to push the white wire

163
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
into a pin 13. and this is where if you

164
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
cut it a little short so it wasn't two

165
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:35,840
inches it doesn't really work

166
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,340
there we go so the white one is in and

167
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,520
[Music]

168
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,919
we're gonna push in the red one into 3.3

169
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,380
volts

170
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,880
[Music]

171
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,880
and these wires are pretty small so

172
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,960
these these both of them will fit and

173
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,479
they stay in pretty good

174
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,240
so now we're going to flip it over so

175
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,960
i'm going to pull it out of the device

176
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,080
and we're going to solder those two

177
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,820
connections

178
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:14,230
[Music]

179
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
and sorry i pretend to be a full-time

180
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,000
slaughter person but i'm not so

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
we're going to see how bad of a mess we

182
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,039
can make but

183
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,479
i'm sure a lot of you are way better

184
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:31,840
experts at this so here we go

185
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,680
there we go that one's nice grab the

186
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:45,520
other one

187
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,879
that one's nice and good so we'll flip

188
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,680
it over and stick in the ground wire

189
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,540
[Music]

190
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,840
and this step-by-step guide is in the

191
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,039
pdf so

192
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,400
don't worry so the ground wire doesn't

193
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,160
have a resistor in it so it's going to

194
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,540
be

195
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,000
[Music]

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,319
a little looser so just be careful when

197
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,639
you flip

198
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,560
okay it'll stay in there for a moment

199
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,639
and then flip it back over

200
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,759
[Music]

201
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,600
so ground is right there

202
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:34,000
[Music]

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,839
hopefully i fell through

204
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,279
this is so tricky when you're looking

205
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,640
between the camera you're not actually

206
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,399
looking at the board

207
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,920
so we have all those connections to make

208
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,680
now i'll just trim it up

209
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,900
so i'll take my tweezers

210
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,029
[Music]

211
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,560
there we go all nice and clean so all we

212
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,080
did was

213
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,959
solder it up the ground through 3.3 with

214
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,720
the other side of the resistor

215
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:23,839
and pin 813 or 13.

216
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,360
we had someone else that needs to be in

217
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:37,839
the room we'll just submit them

218
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,080
so now that we have that connected and

219
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,010
all soldered up

220
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,200
[Music]

221
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
all nice and i'm going to stick this in

222
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,800
a little jig so i have a little

223
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
adapter here i'm just gonna stick this

224
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:04,000
board in there

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,820
rob i'll help admit people okay perfect

226
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:13,890
[Music]

227
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,399
okay that's installed

228
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,160
and sticker for labeling that one

229
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,720
so now let's work with what we've done

230
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,360
as i've installed it right here and we

231
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,000
have the raspberry

232
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,079
pi and so the other option is you can

233
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,959
actually just

234
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,360
solder on connectors and we're going to

235
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,480
stick this board right here

236
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,320
[Music]

237
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,330
so it has the exact same wire setup

238
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:52,759
[Music]

239
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
so what we need to do is install we're

240
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,600
gonna install linux on the raspberry pi

241
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,050
so grab a micro sd card

242
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,290
[Music]

243
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,680
and what we're going to do is going to

244
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,839
share the screen again

245
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,040
it's on the web browser i'll put a link

246
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,690
to here

247
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,000
[Music]

248
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,320
this is the link side to text to all the

249
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,480
project there's download mirror here

250
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,640
so i'll grab this file and i'll throw

251
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,590
this in chat too

252
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:37,039
[Music]

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,920
so for today's workshop i'm just using

254
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,000
raspberry pi os which is buster and i

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,839
just put a clone of this on here

256
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,519
it is the exact same version that you

257
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,200
can get from raspberry pi dot org

258
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,580
so downloads

259
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,639
[Music]

260
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,480
so it is this version it's raspberry pi

261
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,399
32-bit os with desktop

262
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,000
i didn't want to overload their servers

263
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,399
so feel free to download it from here

264
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,959
so i'll start the download i've also

265
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:03,680
mirrored

266
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,200
etcher for linux windows and mac

267
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,760
so on this machine is a pc so let's grab

268
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,839
that

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,399
[Music]

270
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,079
and i'm going to switch this to desktop

271
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:16,750
view

272
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,639
[Music]

273
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:25,839
or the screen there

274
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:39,839
so it's going to start etcher

275
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
and i'm a little worried about

276
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:53,839
everyone's downloading though

277
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:06,160
sorry's downloaded from here too so

278
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,680
hopefully everyone is downloading those

279
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,360
files right now

280
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,440
um if you have pre-installed um just

281
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,040
please wait we're going to basically go

282
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,800
through the pi setup that way everyone

283
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,399
has

284
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,639
the same working environment that way we

285
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,720
can try to mitigate as many bugs as

286
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,680
possible

287
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,360
but if you have a version of raspbian

288
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
with the desktop that should be fine

289
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,290
it's a 32-bit version

290
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,200
[Music]

291
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,839
so we're about 30 seconds left on the

292
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,600
download

293
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,440
um if you don't have a raspbian os if

294
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,680
you have linux such as debian or ubuntu

295
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,760
on the 64-bit version would also work

296
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,360
for what we're trying to do

297
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
but for today we figured it'd be kind of

298
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,880
fun to have everyone

299
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,000
program an iot project on a pi while the

300
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,440
machine chat was also running on the

301
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,760
same pie so it's kind of a

302
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,959
cool way to do iot okay

303
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,839
it is now done so i'll go back to share

304
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,079
screen

305
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,639
it is complete so we're going to go file

306
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,320
flash from file

307
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,199
and there is my downloads open select

308
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:09,839
the target

309
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,880
we have our sd card select

310
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,079
and then flash and then command

311
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,839
prompt came up so everyone missed that

312
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,320
but we are now flashing the micro sd

313
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,720
card

314
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,760
with the latest version of debian for

315
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,279
the raspberry pi

316
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,120
i know not everyone has fast internet so

317
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,639
this might take a little bit but

318
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,160
we'll just kind of go through it quick

319
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,959
and show you all

320
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,839
the default setup

321
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,720
and this is recording so we'll be able

322
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,839
to view it later again

323
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
uh let's go cancel this one that way

324
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,839
don't take all the bandwidth

325
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,000
and so that links that too has all these

326
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,839
again the project files the download

327
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
mirror

328
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,839
there we go now it's validating

329
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
um

330
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,639
okay that is done so we're going to

331
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,480
switch views

332
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,160
new share and we're going to go to the

333
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:51,839
frame grabber

334
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,160
[Music]

335
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,759
and i'll just take a moment as the frame

336
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,919
never comes back up um i've switched

337
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,799
basically to the pi

338
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,240
and it's coming there we go we're seeing

339
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,359
the pi boot

340
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,280
i'll switch to the overhead to make it a

341
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,839
little bit easier

342
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,919
up the pie just rebooted again so it's

343
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,840
just um

344
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,240
so i actually am using a 4k um pi frame

345
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,520
grabbers what i'm actually using

346
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,039
so it's made by elgato so the pi is now

347
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,559
up and running

348
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,080
and the first thing you want to do is

349
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,000
make sure mark down your ip address we

350
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,840
are going to be using that for the rest

351
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,200
of the training so

352
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,120
on this one i have a little note about

353
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
[Music]

354
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,360
which one it is yep we are on the elgato

355
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,880
let's switch to the obs

356
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,000
one there we go now we can see

357
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,100
i can see my hand

358
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,559
[Music]

359
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,480
so make sure to mark down uh write down

360
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,160
what i p address you have in this case

361
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,600
i'm 1.210

362
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,080
hence the sticker on the pi so click

363
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,679
next

364
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,480
and i'm not in the uk so let's do united

365
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,919
states

366
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:43,840
english and we're in center north dakota

367
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:56,080
i'll add a password

368
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
and the screen is fine for this one

369
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,400
we're going to skip the network

370
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,559
[Music]

371
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,840
and then next

372
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840
[Music]

373
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
and i was a good update but i actually

374
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,840
did it

375
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
uh

376
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
um

377
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,919
yeah that's my particular i have a

378
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,280
backup sd card we're just going to

379
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,690
switch it out

380
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,319
[Music]

381
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,480
don't want to make this whole video rely

382
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,919
on my network speed so we're going to

383
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,120
switch in

384
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,158
the backup card that already had that

385
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
pre-installed

386
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,029
[Music]

387
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
uh

388
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,120
so now we're going to go back to the the

389
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,000
workshop view

390
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,369
[Music]

391
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,880
share um back to the screen

392
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,880
so we've soldered the board we're gonna

393
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,840
do a software setup

394
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,120
so we installed raspbian or booted the

395
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,680
pi

396
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,840
[Music]

397
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,280
now we're going to use this version of

398
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,840
arduino if you go to arduino doc

399
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
cc

400
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
so we're gonna we've got the linux

401
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,559
version and the 32-bit and

402
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,640
why is arduino so slow right now

403
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,559
[Music]

404
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,280
might be because we're streaming um this

405
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,340
is also mirrored

406
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,240
[Music]

407
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,480
it's right here i'm going to copy this

408
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,520
into the browser on

409
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,680
the raspberry pi

410
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,880
[Music]

411
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,240
so i'm going to stop the share and

412
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,679
you'll be able to see it from this

413
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,000
so i'm also running synergy on here to

414
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,440
make it a little easier

415
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,280
but we're going to download arduino

416
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,569
[Music]

417
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,200
well let's run let's see if it comes up

418
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:55,840
down let's hear

419
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,760
so on their software download there we

420
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,640
go

421
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,360
so we are using the linux arm 32-bit

422
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,000
that comes right

423
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,440
here yep i'm using someone else i'm

424
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,520
using synergy to actually move the mouse

425
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,640
between my

426
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,919
windows and my raspberry pi however

427
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,919
it doesn't work when i'm sharing this

428
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:20,960
the grabber so

429
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,480
yep it's version 1.12

430
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:37,840
i've had the license for years

431
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,080
so we're going to go back to

432
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,600
[Music]

433
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:51,840
the camera

434
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,279
i wish zoom would actually tell you what

435
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,200
camera you're on there that's the one i

436
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,440
want

437
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,080
[Music]

438
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,520
so now that we've downloaded arduino on

439
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:13,760
the

440
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,480
raspberry pi we're gonna on turret so

441
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,279
tar

442
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,159
xjf and then it's under the downloads

443
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,110
and arduino

444
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,360
[Music]

445
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,760
is it

446
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
yep

447
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,919
yeah so my tars

448
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,799
extract full and then view so we're just

449
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,799
extracting arduino and then i had saved

450
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,400
some extra links in here too in case we

451
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,360
needed to remove

452
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,159
the files so i'm going to bring up that

453
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,240
links.2 document that i shared earlier

454
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:29,840
all this extracts so links to

455
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,159
so we have for installing arduino we're

456
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:38,720
going to add

457
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,600
esp32 support so we can actually program

458
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:57,840
these boards

459
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,600
so go into arduino i know we had a

460
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,880
couple of

461
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,480
other engineers were talking earlier

462
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,080
this morning on the chat about this

463
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,520
wasn't working on some version of

464
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,480
raspbian

465
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,320
but on somebody's raspberry pi 32-bit os

466
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,520
and we could just start arduino and so

467
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,600
by default it's arduino

468
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,520
but we want to add support so you go to

469
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,840
file preferences

470
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,600
and i always like to enable compilation

471
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,279
so i can see what's going on but we want

472
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,320
the esp32 support

473
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,000
so we're going to copy that and put it

474
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,039
in the boards manager

475
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,880
and i forgot this keyboard i stitched

476
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,559
the pi the left control actually doesn't

477
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,039
work

478
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,520
so ctrl c and that's why it was

479
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,559
there we go let's remember that for

480
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,840
today then tools and then boards

481
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,000
now to board manager since we added that

482
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,279
new

483
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,760
option it'll actually search the json

484
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,130
file

485
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,559
[Music]

486
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,720
so now if we type esp32

487
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,680
the esp32 target will come up in a

488
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,009
[Music]

489
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,840
moment

490
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,760
it's a fun one you're always doing a

491
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,679
live demo

492
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,690
what is it doing

493
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,600
[Music]

494
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,240
let's check that preferences again

495
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,039
no that's right

496
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,080
there we go so we're gonna install usb32

497
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,919
version 1.04 it's

498
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,799
a little old their git repo has a lot

499
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,760
more support but

500
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,240
for today this works perfectly fine so

501
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,200
this is going to install

502
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,840
all the packages tied to the esp32

503
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,159
and while this installs i'll also show

504
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:45,840
that in the document

505
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,679
so in this we have her installing it

506
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,880
there's the link how we installed it um

507
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,039
we are going to add another library

508
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,399
that's still installed in the background

509
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,559
so let it go and we're also going to add

510
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,399
the dials temperature and one wire

511
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,559
support to arduino so

512
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,960
we've got four different libraries ota

513
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,600
support

514
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,120
um arduino json dallas one wire

515
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,760
dowel temperature and one wire so on my

516
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,039
pi it now finished

517
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,158
so we're going to switch back to that

518
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
camera

519
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,799
i wish zoom you could actually tell it

520
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,320
select the device and that

521
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,360
is close one more

522
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,360
yeah zoom just gives you a master button

523
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,680
there we go that's the one we want

524
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,640
[Music]

525
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,660
so the esp32 is installed

526
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,240
[Music]

527
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,960
now this over the air library i have a

528
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,840
zip version of it

529
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,520
and all you need to do is under sketch

530
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,000
include library and then add zip library

531
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,120
and of course we gotta download it and

532
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,000
i've also included

533
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,159
a copy of that right here so

534
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,120
esp third of webot master so we're gonna

535
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,240
download you

536
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,640
let it download and now we're gonna

537
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,840
check the downloads folder and there it

538
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
is

539
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,200
so now we have ota support for the esp32

540
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,880
we're going to add a couple more

541
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,960
libraries so manage libraries

542
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,120
[Music]

543
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,000
the first one is arduino json we're

544
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
going to use that library to simplify

545
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,120
some of our software

546
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,440
as far as sending data to machine chat

547
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,790
from the esp32

548
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,679
[Music]

549
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,880
it's not a 100 required library but when

550
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,559
you're doing json

551
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,360
manually it helps out big time so

552
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:04,000
install you

553
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
next we're going to add dallas one wire

554
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,290
support

555
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,880
[Music]

556
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,960
and there's a lot of one wire drivers

557
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,399
this is the one that i just

558
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,080
happened to use the first time and it

559
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
works

560
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,440
and it helps actually spell temperature

561
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:23,750
right

562
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,119
[Music]

563
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,720
so someone's asking on the chat where

564
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,080
it's available again

565
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,559
so if you go on this link file i have a

566
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,880
direct download here

567
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,519
it's in the chat window i posted a link

568
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,679
to all these files it's essentially

569
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,880
the files list right here of the project

570
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,559
page on hackaday

571
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,440
and the otas right here and it was i

572
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,640
basically cloned

573
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,760
a zip repo of the git repo and i'll add

574
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,080
the

575
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,960
git repo later so we're going to add

576
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,600
dallas one wire support which is 390

577
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,679
and it's going to ask about one wire and

578
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,010
we also uninstall that

579
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,549
[Music]

580
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,760
so what i'll do is i'm going to throw

581
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,960
this in chat again just for everyone

582
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,480
and we'll just stop it for a moment

583
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,240
while i throw it in chat

584
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,480
so here's all the files again

585
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,240
try to make it as easy as possible for

586
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,790
everyone share screen back to the camera

587
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,960
[Music]

588
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,799
two three four five and it's

589
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,600
that one perfect

590
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,080
so now that that's installed um also

591
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,960
download

592
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,200
all the labs for today the remotion

593
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,960
esp32 we're going to get that ready

594
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,039
and then finally there's two files at

595
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,840
the bottom this is machine chat jedi one

596
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,320
for

597
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,640
the raspberry pi and then for a standard

598
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,360
linux

599
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,559
pc um this is 64-bit only i have not

600
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,480
tried on 32-bit so i don't know that

601
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,559
works we had that chat come up earlier

602
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,360
today

603
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,679
and yeah i just don't have a 32-bit x86

604
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,679
machine anymore

605
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,000
so we're going to download this one

606
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:25,840
so open the new tab

607
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,440
so we're going to first we're going to

608
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,600
do is show you what we downloaded

609
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,720
so we're going to unzip the machine chat

610
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
project

611
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,360
and that creates the bin and readme what

612
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,679
i'm going to do is

613
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,880
start jedi one machine chat we're going

614
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,799
to use the service

615
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,080
and then install it so that way it'll

616
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,120
start up on every

617
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,279
uh reboot and then we're going to start

618
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,279
it

619
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,960
so now if you go to your web browser

620
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,040
and just do localhost 9123

621
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,918
which is the default on port we'll get

622
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,359
our jedi instance

623
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,520
and it's as htop running

624
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,839
so jedi 1 is on here

625
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,040
i keep forgetting that left control

626
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,480
doesn't work anymore

627
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,879
the default username password is admin

628
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,800
and admin

629
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,239
so i'm just going to log into it and

630
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,678
basically create the first user

631
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,918
so admin

632
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,239
and we come up with the good old ules

633
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,839
i just accept and new password i'll call

634
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,480
a password

635
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,599
and then it asks a bunch of security

636
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,480
questions first car

637
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,839
see delorean

638
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,200
pet's name ralph

639
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,720
high school school

640
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,930
and then save

641
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,760
[Music]

642
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,200
and then we log in for the first time

643
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,400
and now i gotta remember what password i

644
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,930
did i was pretty sure it's password

645
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,400
[Music]

646
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,040
so this is the default interface we have

647
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,599
the home

648
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,520
dashboards where we can create data

649
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,200
views

650
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,720
system views and right now we're not

651
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,240
sending any data

652
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,880
but i just wanted to show basically this

653
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,190
fired up for the first time

654
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,480
[Music]

655
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,440
so this is the general layout and while

656
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,200
this runs we're just going to go

657
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,640
and actually start programming the usb

658
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,560
32 now

659
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,720
so let's go to the downloads we've also

660
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,200
downloaded all the projects

661
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,839
so we want to unzip a remote

662
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,320
control and in this we have five

663
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,920
projects lab one through five

664
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,040
so we're gonna bring up the arduino

665
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,500
again

666
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,880
[Music]

667
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,640
let's put this full screen it's right

668
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,400
now set up for the uno

669
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,520
for everyone who got boards today it's

670
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,079
the

671
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,760
you can use the same board so we're

672
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,280
gonna go to board or choose the esp32

673
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,640
and we're gonna go down here for the

674
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,720
adafruit esp32 feather

675
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,960
now there's a get commit to add support

676
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,640
for the sparkfun board

677
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,760
but as of 1.04 it doesn't actually it's

678
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,520
not in here so that's why we have to use

679
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,599
the adafruit feather

680
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,280
even on the sparkfun board so we're

681
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,680
using the same board for everyone

682
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,480
and i'm going to switch to the overhead

683
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,760
and i'm also going to plug

684
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,920
in this device so i got the usb cable

685
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,720
and we're going to plug you in

686
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,280
so now we should see a com port so go to

687
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,839
port

688
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,520
and then usb 0.

689
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,260
and in arduino go to file and then open

690
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,680
[Music]

691
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,599
go to the download directory which was

692
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,839
pi downloads

693
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,599
emoticon and then lab one and lab one

694
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,880
is just i'll close this one and bring

695
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,839
this one up

696
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,280
lab1 is just an ota demo

697
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,599
for this lab i set up the ssid and

698
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,000
password the same on my network

699
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,880
so when you bring up the lab 1 make sure

700
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,839
you change

701
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,079
your ssi and password to what your

702
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,320
network would be looking for

703
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,119
and all this demo does is basically it

704
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,320
fires up and just

705
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,480
has the over-the-air update looking for

706
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,560
it

707
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,240
so it's a really simple demo i've also

708
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,880
added mndns for this

709
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,180
so let's build it

710
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,480
[Music]

711
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,400
and if you have a raspberry pi 3 this

712
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,320
will take about twice as long

713
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,640
this is a raspberry pi 4 i think four

714
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,440
gigabits

715
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,400
per gigabyte model

716
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,280
for everyone running linux x86 it's

717
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:05,680
there

718
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,118
are they already done compiling so

719
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,280
but for this workshop because i'd be

720
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,520
pretty cool that you could program on a

721
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,079
pi

722
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,280
your esp32 projects while running

723
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:32,320
machine chat on the pi at the same time

724
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:47,839
i'll just make this a little bigger

725
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,839
um

726
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,720
the first time you build it nothing's

727
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,040
been cached so it's

728
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,800
on further rebuilds it'll be a lot

729
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,060
faster but the first one a little bit

730
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,880
[Music]

731
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,839
slow

732
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,900
there we go lincoln

733
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,340
[Music]

734
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,560
so i built it now let's program it sadly

735
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,079
this is going to rebuild parts of it but

736
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,880
it won't take as long

737
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:25,839
because he's in all the cache libraries

738
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,140
so now it's programming it serial port

739
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,160
[Music]

740
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,599
now i should have had the serial monitor

741
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,040
open before i did this but we'll just

742
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,599
let it

743
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,680
flash program and hit the reset button

744
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,000
later

745
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,760
so it wrote all the data let's go to the

746
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,720
serial monitor

747
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,560
[Music]

748
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,079
change it to a baud rate that makes

749
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,160
sense for this lab

750
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,520
i'm just going to hit the reset button

751
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,990
on the esp

752
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,800
[Music]

753
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,079
so it's coming up connect to the wi-fi

754
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,960
and we have our address and so i re

755
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,400
pre-tested these that's where the 312

756
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,599
comes from

757
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,520
so if we go to 312 8080 and then webo

758
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,640
io iot

759
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,720
[Music]

760
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,839
see this is the pre-link i set up

761
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,560
so here we go

762
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,119
now what we can do is in arduino

763
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,599
if you go to sketch you can export a

764
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,720
compiled binary

765
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,400
so this will take a little bit to build

766
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,040
again but it'll give us a binary that we

767
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,839
can actually upload

768
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,839
now open this folder so we can see

769
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,640
what's going on if we go to downloads

770
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,359
here's the labs lab one so it created

771
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,839
this binary

772
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,119
so if we go to the web browser again and

773
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,130
then choose file

774
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,400
[Music]

775
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,000
and downloads

776
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,400
one and then the bin and then open it

777
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,680
and we click update we can actually

778
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,760
watch it and it is actually reports in

779
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,100
the serial term at the same time

780
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,520
[Music]

781
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,200
so when this gets done this should

782
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,860
reboot

783
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,159
[Music]

784
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,800
there we go reboot it and of course it's

785
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,920
the same program so it's

786
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,240
hard to prove that actually rebooted but

787
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,680
it did because we're gonna move on to

788
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,880
lab two and

789
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
we're gonna add something different so

790
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,400
if we go back to lab one

791
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,440
and now we're gonna open lab two so we

792
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,500
want lab2

793
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,680
[Music]

794
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,160
so in this lab we're enabling the

795
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,760
internal temperature sensor

796
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,359
this is something i didn't know until

797
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,960
earlier this week that a lot of these

798
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,640
esp32s actually have an on-dye

799
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,319
temperature sensor it's not that

800
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:58,960
accurate

801
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,680
but it works for we want so first thing

802
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,079
to do

803
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,119
is add the ssid and password again in my

804
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,640
case my demo wi-fi network for today

805
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,960
and we're just gonna is it the only

806
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,240
change yep just the

807
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,599
wi-fi so we're going to build it so all

808
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,040
we've added to this project is

809
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,720
essentially i'm reading the internal

810
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,920
temperature sensor and we're going to

811
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:27,839
report it over the serial port

812
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,960
i should say all these labs are on

813
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,119
github too so

814
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,640
if you want to access them later or see

815
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,040
changes as we fix other things up

816
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,839
they're pretty much always available

817
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,599
what's up for remote con esp32 the demo

818
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,119
is right here i was tweaking them late

819
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,400
last night

820
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,000
but you just find them under ewiki

821
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,839
machine chat

822
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,520
or if you follow me on github already

823
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,680
you probably saw that i uploaded them so

824
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,560
this is lab2 and we have okay it's built

825
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:36,640
now we want to export the binary

826
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,520
there we go now we go back to the

827
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,920
browser

828
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,800
and just refresh this we're in 312 and

829
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,079
want to make sure you can see the serial

830
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,599
term at the same time so i'll choose

831
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,800
file

832
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,400
for this we're going to use lab2

833
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,359
[Music]

834
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,480
and open and then update and then switch

835
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,599
to that one

836
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,920
so we have what's nice ot actually says

837
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,839
the file name here too

838
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,400
so when this reboots we should have a

839
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:18,560
report of the hyundai temperature sensor

840
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,560
so i was connecting to the wi-fi i got a

841
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,599
connection

842
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,319
there we go so this is what i've been

843
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,079
seeing so far it's not the most accurate

844
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,680
temperature sensor but it gives us some

845
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,480
data

846
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,640
if you blow a fan or get a worm

847
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,960
so you've got a question yep i'm using

848
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,820
usb0

849
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,839
[Music]

850
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,200
oh yeah that's a good question how do

851
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,880
you find the page for

852
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,440
um the overlayer update it's if you get

853
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,640
as long as you get the serial port it's

854
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,000
right here so this will actually work

855
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,680
too you can just copy this

856
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,720
let's see control c

857
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,359
control v and then that'll work

858
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,720
i didn't wasn't trusting this would

859
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,000
actually work on my network but it seems

860
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,280
to i just

861
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,040
hard coded the ip address

862
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,440
um if you're not sure what usb port it

863
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,280
comes up in linux you can always

864
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,800
hit the message and in our case our usb

865
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,079
when we plugged it in became

866
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,400
devty 0.

867
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,610
[Music]

868
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,960
so the bin file is when you export it's

869
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,800
always from the project location

870
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,000
so when i when we unzip the

871
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
project files we have lab1 lab2

872
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,280
when you hit the export it it's relative

873
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:43,359
to the ino file

874
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,960
and then we had someone had a timeout

875
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,000
if there's a timeout um just hit the

876
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,680
reset button on your esp32

877
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,319
and then try again to reprogram it i

878
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:56,960
know

879
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,160
some of the boards are always a little

880
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:58,990
picky but

881
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:02,680
[Music]

882
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,079
so enable this

883
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,110
we're going to move on to lab three

884
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,319
[Music]

885
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,119
lab three adds the dallas one wire so

886
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,000
with lab three

887
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,330
we now have the dallas one wire enabled

888
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:21,680
[Music]

889
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,680
we want to enable our password and ssid

890
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,950
save it so a little more code

891
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,440
[Music]

892
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,640
and then we're going to print out the

893
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,200
one wire

894
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,760
oh yep so the command for d message is

895
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,400
just a

896
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,820
d m e s g

897
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,599
[Music]

898
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,640
and then you'll get the div i don't

899
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,160
remember what the proper term for it is

900
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,079
and then some people are asking master

901
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,760
only has i know files um there's

902
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,800
cat there's actually two downloads

903
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,000
so if you go back to the files um

904
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,839
this is all the project files the remote

905
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,440
con esp32

906
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,559
the web ota is just a library to add

907
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,240
over the air support

908
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,119
it's not an official um arduino project

909
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,880
yet so you can't search for it in the

910
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,400
libraries you actually have to use the

911
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,599
github version

912
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,520
and download the zip so that's why i

913
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,240
just provided this version

914
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
um in arduino there's another one i

915
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,839
haven't played for too much but i've had

916
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,599
a lot of good success with this library

917
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,119
that's why i chose it for today

918
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,680
so back to lab three all lab three does

919
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,960
is enable

920
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,880
the next sensor so we're progressively

921
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,760
we have a default esp32 we add the over

922
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,160
the

923
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,880
update support in the first lab we add

924
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,000
the first temperature

925
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,839
next lab we add the one wire temperature

926
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:48,240
sensor

927
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,920
and then the next lab we're going to add

928
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,440
the json

929
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,680
encoding and finally the last one is

930
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,480
going to send the data to machine chat

931
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,680
so if you want to cheat you can just

932
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,720
jump to a lab 5.

933
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,160
the idea with this was we could go

934
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,079
progressively through um adding more

935
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,400
features but

936
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,000
the code's pretty much the same for all

937
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,240
of them

938
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,359
for lab five make sure you change this

939
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:18,640
to what your raspberry pi

940
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,960
actually is though in my case i 190 1681

941
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,720
210 that came up on the first time you

942
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,400
booted the raspberry pi but you can also

943
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,920
find it by just doing

944
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,359
sudo if config minus a and just look at

945
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,960
the first entry

946
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,520
so sudo if config minus a and there's

947
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,440
the ip address of my raspberry pi

948
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:45,440
which will come in handy for five

949
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,079
yep um by default this is a remote con

950
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,720
esp320 file is only ino you need to

951
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,680
build it

952
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,440
when you build it the bin file is

953
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,800
created so

954
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,440
if we go back to the lab folder here so

955
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,000
we just did

956
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,040
lab three and it's just an il file

957
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,680
if you go to lab two there's the bin so

958
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,960
if i go back to my lab

959
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,800
three and say sketch export compiled

960
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,000
binary

961
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,950
it's gonna start building that bin

962
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:15,669
[Music]

963
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:27,839
compiling sketch

964
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,319
there we go it finished building go back

965
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:38,558
to lab three and now the bin file exists

966
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,839
so

967
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,680
yeah try yeah try a different usb port

968
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,800
or

969
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,319
sometimes it's a different cable i know

970
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,040
we shipped off fresh cables with these

971
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,480
but sometimes you never know

972
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,800
let's see go back to i got a camera

973
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,000
right in front of my monitor so this is

974
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
kind of fun to view

975
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,319
back to this reload and i'm going to

976
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,440
upload lab

977
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,839
3 over the air

978
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,960
and then open i want to have that ready

979
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,359
and then

980
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:23,839
update

981
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,839
um

982
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
um the python script that is used to

983
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,240
program the esp322

984
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,119
should stop it so in the id if you click

985
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:47,920
the upload

986
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,839
it should force a reset

987
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,240
i know on some of the early esp32 boards

988
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,319
it would lock up

989
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,079
so this is now running we have our

990
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,440
temperature so if i

991
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,200
grab the temp sensor and hold it for a

992
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,720
little bit

993
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,300
these ones take a little bit to go

994
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,499
[Music]

995
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,630
or my hands are really really cold

996
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,599
[Music]

997
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,160
there we go 71.6 it's coming up but

998
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,280
these are meant for

999
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,319
underwater so it takes a lot to get them

1000
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,319
to move with just your hand

1001
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,599
there goes 17.5

1002
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,480
so now moving on to lab four

1003
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,599
so file open

1004
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,400
so lab four we're taking that same

1005
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,079
data now that we've had done for a while

1006
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,559
the esp32 and the one wire

1007
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,079
and we're actually creating a json

1008
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,720
string out of it and this arduino json

1009
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,359
makes this really easy

1010
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,480
word six lines of code it was

1011
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,640
lots of lots of shifting and mess

1012
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,870
so we're gonna basically create a json

1013
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,240
[Music]

1014
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,170
so go up here enable my wi-fi point

1015
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:10,880
[Music]

1016
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,480
and then save

1017
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,240
start building and we're also going to

1018
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,920
print the json data so you can see what

1019
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,200
the data looks like when it's going to

1020
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:29,839
be going over the ethernet in lab 5.

1021
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,160
so between labs three and four this is

1022
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:43,839
all we really added

1023
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,839
um

1024
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,680
the other thing to check um for people

1025
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,119
are having problems connecting try

1026
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,960
changing this speed down

1027
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,559
because you have the port which will

1028
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,720
usually be usb0

1029
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,319
but sometimes i've had luck bringing

1030
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,000
this down to four six or twenty three

1031
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,880
hundred

1032
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:25,839
because ninety six about is pretty fast

1033
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,550
okay you're down to 11500

1034
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:30,859
[Music]

1035
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,599
the other thing you might want to check

1036
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,520
double check your solder points

1037
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,880
so i got a couple different boards here

1038
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:53,839
where's another one

1039
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,440
[Music]

1040
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,200
so i would double check um

1041
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,119
oops so 13 if it's too close to the usb

1042
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,640
but double check to make sure it didn't

1043
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,520
bridge

1044
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,040
because i know that one might cause some

1045
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,559
issues

1046
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,839
and then you got three volts on the

1047
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,200
reset

1048
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,119
so right here you got the three volts we

1049
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,960
use for the uh

1050
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,640
the pull up and then the resets right

1051
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,079
next to it so double check that one if

1052
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:35,839
there's a bridge

1053
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,839
i know i had problems on those right

1054
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,000
next to 13 is 12. i had problems on 12

1055
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,680
of one wire so

1056
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:49,170
double check that one too

1057
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:52,489
[Music]

1058
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,480
okay this is done building it's a little

1059
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:03,839
sketch and now we're going to export it

1060
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,839
um

1061
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,960
so that is built so if i go to lab four

1062
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,400
we'll have

1063
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,740
the bin file now so i'll go to

1064
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:35,200
[Music]

1065
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,330
let's grab lab4

1066
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:40,750
[Music]

1067
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,040
and then update and then where are you

1068
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:59,839
there you are

1069
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:13,040
and now we have our pretty data we're

1070
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,079
this is what we're going to be

1071
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,400
transmitting to machine shot

1072
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,880
and you could do this as serial prints

1073
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,920
and

1074
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,960
a whole bunch of slashes in your string

1075
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,920
struct but

1076
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,500
arduino json makes it nice

1077
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,000
[Music]

1078
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,760
so we're going to jump into lab 5

1079
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,359
then we can start sending data to the

1080
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:36,960
board so

1081
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,839
lab 5.

1082
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,119
so on this one we want to enable our

1083
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,680
wi-fi credentials again

1084
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,720
and we want to enable the host

1085
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,119
so this is the raspberry pi that i have

1086
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:56,480
in the lab that's running jedi

1087
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,720
the same one that we're demoing through

1088
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,760
so if you look at

1089
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,319
suit if config again 192.168.1 to 210

1090
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:09,200
and you can also verify it by going to

1091
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,799
let's change this from localhost to one

1092
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,240
put an unlock on 192. 168. that one is a

1093
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,720
210.

1094
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,200
that'll be some other random thing in my

1095
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,040
network

1096
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,310
let's put a zero on it

1097
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,240
[Music]

1098
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,760
zero doesn't work on this keyboard

1099
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,820
that's what happens when you grab a junk

1100
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:34,199
[Music]

1101
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,839
keyboard

1102
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,839
same issue i want check the permissions

1103
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:51,839
of

1104
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,000
um

1105
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,799
make sure you have dialogue access i'm

1106
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,960
thinking

1107
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,440
so look open add to group and make sure

1108
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,160
your user

1109
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,079
has access to dialogue that gives you

1110
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,559
access to dev ttdy0

1111
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:11,680
and that might be

1112
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,000
[Music]

1113
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,760
just a just a hunch because i think

1114
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,599
python uses it but it could call it a

1115
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:17,980
pseudo

1116
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:21,260
[Music]

1117
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,720
so this is saved

1118
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,480
so here's where we're sending the data

1119
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,160
so when we're connected we're going to

1120
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,200
create a client

1121
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,079
http we're going to grab the host and

1122
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,910
we're going to send the data right here

1123
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:41,270
[Music]

1124
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:47,839
and so build

1125
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,880
and while it's built i'm going to jump

1126
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,520
into jedi one and show you that

1127
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,040
i'm not cheating so we're going to go to

1128
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,040
data storage

1129
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,240
and then manage data

1130
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:15,040
we got a little bit 11-7 when was that

1131
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,920
i'll delete that

1132
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:23,680
so data storage i think i didn't clean

1133
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,440
out this compute this raspberry pi

1134
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,119
perfectly when i was

1135
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,040
so managed data okay we have no data

1136
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,540
perfect

1137
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:32,659
[Music]

1138
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,920
i still have lab 5 on this esp32

1139
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,440
when i fired up the first time so it

1140
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,839
sends some data to machine chat

1141
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,760
there we go it was built now let's

1142
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,079
generate the binary

1143
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:25,839
so you can use web ota

1144
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,760
yeah it's it's slow to compile the pie

1145
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,160
[Music]

1146
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,160
the idea one of the big ideas was that

1147
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,520
we could all

1148
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,040
so that worried about it have a windows

1149
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,720
linux or a mac machine we just all do it

1150
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,040
on the pi

1151
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:47,969
[Music]

1152
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,799
so there we go we have the binary

1153
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:56,720
so we want 312

1154
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,450
and we want lab5

1155
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,600
[Music]

1156
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,720
and then open and we want to make sure

1157
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,680
that's available then click update

1158
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:21,839
so we're sending in lab 5 over

1159
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,559
so let's connection network where's

1160
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,640
now we have a new response http response

1161
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,480
200 so

1162
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,480
if you use the http lookup table you'll

1163
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,559
see that means it actually transmitted

1164
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,079
and everything's working good so if we

1165
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,440
go to the web browser for jedi one

1166
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,200
and hit refresh and go to data storage

1167
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,960
[Music]

1168
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,640
and manage data storage we should have

1169
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,400
data down so there

1170
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,960
are two variables one wire temp and esp

1171
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,079
temp

1172
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,720
so using we're gonna go straight to the

1173
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,470
dashboard and create a data view

1174

01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,720
so this is what i love about machine

1176
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,359
chat just click add chart

1177
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:18,740
this will be internal

1178
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,039
[Music]

1179
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,559
temp i should just really throw this

1180
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:30,160
keyboard away

1181
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,839
and we'll just use a line chart for

1182
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,359
today

1183
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:36,240
so we can easily pick the source uh

1184
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,920
we're doing it from workshop lab

1185
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,160
five and actually go over that too in

1186
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,440
the lab five

1187
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,160
so that we're actually sending as a

1188
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,440
variable that we created

1189
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,200
so jedi id this is how you can define

1190
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,160
different devices so if you have

1191
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,039
multiple

1192
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,920
things sending data so this is workshop

1193
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,520
esp32 from lab5

1194
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,200
and then from the properties we got two

1195
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,680
options we got the esp32 or one wire

1196
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,480
but we want the sp32 these are in

1197
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,000
fahrenheit and we're sending data like

1198
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,880
crazy so let's just refresh

1199
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,119
and there we go there's our data of the

1200
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:16,080
internal temp sensor

1201
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,079
[Music]

1202
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,920
and we can look at the other one this is

1203
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,319
the

1204
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:27,839
one wire

1205
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,400
let's just change this to lab5 property

1206
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,000
the one wire unison f

1207
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,400
and then we can let's create 175.

1208
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,160
we could do some crazy things less than

1209
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,799
60. oh man zero key doesn't work on this

1210
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:52,839
[Music]

1211
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:55,039
keyboard

1212
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,119
so it's a really nice interface to make

1213
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:58,559
different rules

1214
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,640
and then we can move on into a system

1215
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,140
view

1216
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:05,200
[Music]

1217
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,400
select the gauge is a nice one

1218
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,000
so if you're watching like a gauge in

1219
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,520
the like

1220
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,240
say your pool outside right now in

1221
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,200
northern minnesota

1222
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,960
that's pretty much we're done for that

1223
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,640
but

1224
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,930
and so one wire units are f

1225
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:25,049
[Music]

1226
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,920
so this allows you to put a background

1227
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,440
on here i

1228
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,119
didn't pre-download any files but

1229
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:36,079
essentially you take a jpeg or anything

1230
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,880
look up um

1231
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:51,400
gyarado lane

1232
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,650
[Music]

1233
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,119
this will probably fail we're going to

1234
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:05,839
do it anyways

1235
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,480
so definitely not the scale but let's

1236
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,680
say the sensor's right here on the house

1237
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,000
um why do we use ota when everything is

1238
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,960
through usb

1239
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,000
um just to make it was a cool thing that

1240
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,319
i

1241
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,839
found like oh this was an awesome way to

1242
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:35,440
do esp32s

1243
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,039
you could program it through the serial

1244
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,880
port on every lab but

1245
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,680
for a lot of these sensors it's outside

1246
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,319
somewhere

1247
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:46,000
you don't always want to go to it

1248
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
once you start doing ota it's like it

1249
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
just makes things easier

1250
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,720
[Music]

1251
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,960
so this is the system view

1252
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,839
[Music]

1253
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,520
so this is a dashboard you can create

1254
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,960
for users just to log in

1255
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,680
and see quick of the data because not

1256
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,720
everyone wants to see

1257
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,359
you know by the second data

1258
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,720
and you can actually create rules um

1259
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,319
this is a nice dragon drive let's call

1260
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,319
it um

1261
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:21,920
pool protect

1262
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,839
say the so we're gonna look at the

1263
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,280
condition so this

1264
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,510
we want the one wire temp

1265
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:31,599
[Music]

1266
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,570
if it's less than or equal to

1267
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:35,520
[Music]

1268
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:43,839
and then some number

1269
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:47,200
and then you create an action usually

1270
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,400
these actions are

1271
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,839
whether email or sms

1272
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,520
correct if you hit the one um in arduino

1273
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,200
if you click this one it'll program and

1274
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,480
upload it yep so you don't have to go

1275
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,130
through the ota

1276
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:05,680
[Music]

1277
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,930
so we can save this

1278
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:09,359
[Music]

1279
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,799
as far as notifications you can set up

1280
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,559
email and sms

1281
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,319
um if you use email make sure you use

1282
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:17,600
the gmail um

1283
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,719
app password i didn't write one down but

1284
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:25,839
it's it's pretty easy

1285
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,880
yeah thanks daryl for that yep or in the

1286
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,560
case of one of my esp32

1287
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,238
it's kind of frozen in the pool right

1288
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:35,520
now so you kind of can't get to it

1289
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,640
it'll be nice of that ota but if you

1290
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,560
have a bunch of sensors in your

1291
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,319
industrial environment ot is pretty nice

1292
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,600
but if you're at your desk you can

1293
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,560
program more usb

1294
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,319
so we can actually add more users and

1295
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:53,040
different users have different abilities

1296
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,520
you have two roles user admin you can

1297
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,960
make it so people could just view your

1298
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,439
data

1299
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,520
or admin they can pretty much delete

1300
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,120
everything

1301
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,439
you can define your data storage for how

1302
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,960
long you want to keep it

1303
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,640
and they have some nice debugging for

1304
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,120
diagnostics

1305
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,158
but the rules are the nicest thing so

1306
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:13,040
workshop

1307
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,920
you can enable and disable them there's

1308
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,279
other ways of doing data collects

1309
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,439
i've mostly been playing with http but

1310
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:20,640
you can actually do

1311
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,319
python scripts here too under the custom

1312
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:24,960
plugin

1313
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,839
so you can actually have this read a

1314
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,759
bunch of local sensors

1315
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,520
daryl and the machine chat team have a

1316
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,920
bunch of awesome blogs showing how to

1317
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,839
plug in a bunch of bme280s

1318
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,839
and other temp sensors right into the pi

1319
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:49,839
and make it

1320
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,320
and home assistant integration um is

1321
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,480
there a python script for that

1322
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,960
yep i've the video will be i believe

1323
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,960
magenta said they would be on youtube at

1324
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:16,960
the end and it'll be hosted again so

1325
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:30,239
so go back to this

1326
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:33,280
so add another chart

1327
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:45,840
yeah we did the gauge already

1328
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,000
so you do a lot of different

1329
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,570
customization with these different

1330
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:07,160
[Music]

1331
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,840
charts

1332
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,000
so when you compare your the the gateway

1333
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,280
and what the code you actually have to

1334
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,800
send to it it works

1335
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,440
really nice it's pretty simple all we're

1336
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,880
sending to it is essentially

1337
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,520
some json

1338
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,320
and then you can view these we don't

1339
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,239
have a lot of data but you can actually

1340
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:57,120
view this by

1341
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,080
all the data over time so this one's

1342
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,640
only been running for a little bit

1343
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:05,329
[Music]

1344
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,880
so you can actually zoom into the past

1345
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,320
yeah if we go here there's not a lot of

1346
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:23,840
data because there's nothing yesterday

1347
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,199
yeah if i run this a little bit more we

1348
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,960
can see more i can actually bring up

1349
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,280
another one that i have run in so we can

1350
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,430
actually see a lot more data

1351
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:39,689
[Music]

1352
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,480
[Music]

1353
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:51,839
3.104 i think it's 104.

1354
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,320
i'm going to switch to my other computer

1355
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,520
so i can do this a little easier

1356
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,440
[Music]

1357
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:19,679
so screen share and basic there we go

1358
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,380
screen and then share

1359
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:28,640
[Music]

1360
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,920
get this one and then password manager

1361
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,239
to the

1362
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,270
data collectors

1363
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:40,549
[Music]

1364
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,320
oh yeah this one is not connected

1365
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,000
anymore this was a

1366
01:13:48,000 --> 01:14:01,840
sam iot board nine one

1367
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,340
so this one is this is the backyard pool

1368
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:12,960
[Music]

1369
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,880
and that's always in the wrong spot so

1370
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,090
we could look at

1371
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:19,390
[Music]

1372
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,840
apply

1373
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,640
okay so people are asking how about lab

1374
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,600
five again

1375
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,040
so we could review data this was

1376
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,960
beginning of the month and we could zoom

1377
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,800
in into different times

1378
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,080
so when you have lots of data it's

1379
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,520
really nice to look at here you can see

1380
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:43,820
how

1381
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,520
[Music]

1382
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,000
things changed over time and of course

1383
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,440
of today's demo we've only been running

1384
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,120
for a little bit so we don't have a lot

1385
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,880
of data to work with so i just

1386
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,360
switched over and then we had someone uh

1387
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,920
jri is asking about esp32

1388
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,120
um double check that you changed

1389
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,470
um

1390
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:04,320
[Music]

1391
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,400
well i'm going to bring up the gift

1392
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,440
version

1393
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,960
that you actually added your server

1394
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:15,440
so in lab 5

1395
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,800
you want to make sure you change the

1396
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,440
demo wi-fi for the ssid and password but

1397
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,320
you also change

1398
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,440
the host and make sure you

1399
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:29,678
disable that let's switch back

1400
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:39,839
if i switch to the capture

1401
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:53,840
let's switch to

1402
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,920
and get to the right camera there we go

1403
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,750
so jri when you're looking at lab five

1404
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:12,159
[Music]

1405
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,520
so you change the ssid and the password

1406
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,159
but you also need to change the host

1407
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:20,239
and so you have the ip my case this

1408
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:23,520
computer is 192.168.1.210

1409
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,719
and leave the port 8100 you can actually

1410
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,560
change the machine chat but

1411
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,640
for by default state it's that and so

1412
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,239
when i look at the raspberry pi

1413
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:36,480
and do sudo if config minus a

1414
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,520
the address of this computer is 192 168

1415
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,800
1.210

1416
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,120
so verify that on your pc and make sure

1417
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,480
these are the same

1418
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,839
so change these this little bit

1419
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,719
and then you can verify quickly in

1420
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:53,920
machine chat

1421
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,280
that you're actually getting data by

1422
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,159
looking at the data storage

1423
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,239
manage storage data and then if you

1424
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:01,840
start seeing some data here you know

1425
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,239
instantly you have it

1426
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:06,000
for people that are worried about where

1427
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:16,480
their data is stored

1428
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,159
top of my head remember it's thickest

1429
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:31,839
metrics so switch through it

1430
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,440
everything is stored locally in

1431
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,280
non-binary form

1432
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,440
so if you're worried about your data it

1433
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,480
is stored locally

1434
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,920
you got time timestamps on it and it's

1435
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,110
not encoded randomly

1436
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:51,478
[Music]

1437
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,400
yep there's two ports so um port 9123 is

1438
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,960
what the browser uses 8100

1439
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,920
is the data transfer port and if you

1440
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:02,960
look in jedi one

1441
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,480
so i'm using port 9123 to connect over

1442
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:11,280
ethernet to get this view if we go to

1443
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,920
the data storage or data collectors and

1444
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,180
then click edit here

1445
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,880
[Music]

1446
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,040
here's where the 8100 comes from so it's

1447
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,440
actually looking on port 8100

1448
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,880
you can change this so if you were to

1449
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,560
change this here make sure in the lab

1450
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,840
you update 8100

1451
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,560
i guess at this point do we want to open

1452
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,239
it up for audio questions

1453
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,960
or more check questions or try to think

1454
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,679
what we want to do

1455
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
because we got about a half hour left or

1456
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,560
20 minutes

1457
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,840
so there's a question about um licensing

1458
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,159
um

1459
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,239
the two pricing points um have a limited

1460
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:11,199
number of devices

1461
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:14,320
um machine chat has plans for

1462
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,440
a per um beyond that so it's kind of

1463
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,400
just to get you jump

1464
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,719
jumping and started

1465
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,320
and what's nice about the raspberry pi

1466
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,520
pricing if you look at it it's about

1467
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,679
half of the x86 and you get about half

1468
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,199
the number of devices

1469
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:32,560
and i'll actually run um let's see i'll

1470
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,840
log in over

1471
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,280
um i can actually show you how much

1472
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,120
resources this actually take and it's

1473
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:51,840
pretty small

1474
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,120
there we go i mean arduino uh we better

1475
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,640
kill arduino though we can actually read

1476
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,000
the other things going on

1477
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,400
so i'll kill you kill that one

1478
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,159
but this is a raspberry pi 4

1479
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:14,719
with 5 12 or 4 gigs of ram

1480
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:16,320
and chromium is running too so let's

1481
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,280
kill that

1482
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,800
i also got one there so it's very little

1483
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,719
resources

1484
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,040
point eight on the beaglebone black with

1485
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,800
um only five hundred twelve to make a

1486
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,320
single

1487
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,639
core it's about the same point something

1488
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:33,360
in memory

1489
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:47,839
it's very little resources

1490
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,080
i should mention on this too so this in

1491
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,600
this lab demo we're doing this is

1492
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,280
technically one device sending multiple

1493
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,239
data points

1494
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,719
so you could add easily so right now

1495
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,239
we're using

1496
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:06,080
yep response code 200 there you go

1497
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,040
gerald you got it working

1498
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,400
oh that's crazy usb 3 was actually the

1499
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,040
issue too

1500
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,520
so in the licensing um in the raspberry

1501
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,320
pi um

1502
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,560
with not paid for it this is one device

1503
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:29,840
even though it's multiple data points

1504
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,400
and so the free version has up to four

1505
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,560
devices monitoring number users two and

1506
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,840
two rules

1507
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,280
but if you ever designed your own

1508
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,520
dashboard for iot it's it's

1509
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,880
just going to start sending data to

1510
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,960
machine chat and they'll just start

1511
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,400
figuring out what to do with it so as

1512
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,080
long as it's consistent data

1513
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,400
there's plenty of rules for changing

1514
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,520
data types

1515
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,199
they're doing lots of nice development

1516
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,360
so i'm really looking forward to see

1517
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,800
what this application will be down the

1518
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,040
road

1519
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,719
and the lowest power device i actually

1520
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,840
had working on this was the mega

1521
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,120
48. i haven't been able to get the uno

1522
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,560
to work and send data the

1523
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,159
wi-fi stack was just a little too big

1524
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,239
but if you have some really low power

1525
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,690
8-bit microcontroller sending data to it

1526
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:36,840
[Music]

1527
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,840
easily

1528
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,040
so go back to the screen

1529
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,840
so we did machine chat did the setup we

1530
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,000
did all the labs

1531
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,639
it works for the gui with the gui

1532
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:11,199
there's

1533
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,199
endless configurations you can do i just

1534
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,199
want to have if you have any questions

1535
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:15,760
um

1536
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,080
my email forum otherwise we had

1537
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,639
let's bring these up so the

1538
01:23:21,639 --> 01:23:23,440
forum.digikey is where we

1539
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,360
do that's pretty much where i spend all

1540
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,520
day now answering questions

1541
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,440
the classic ewiki which a lot of people

1542
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,240
remember me from

1543
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,480
[Music]

1544
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,480
and then all the labs from today

1545
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,879
[Music]

1546
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,280
so i'm just gonna throw up the thank you

1547
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,239
slide and then we'll still ask for

1548
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:44,960
questions though

1549
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,840
i want to make sure we at least did that

1550
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:54,560
so there's a lot of things coming with

1551
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,719
this um one of the cool ones i want to

1552
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:58,159
try and figure out is bluetooth there's

1553
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,840
a lot of bluetooth sensors it'd be nice

1554
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:00,639
to

1555
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:01,900
get it on both sides working

1556
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:06,880
[Music]

1557
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,080
because wi-fi is a little bit bigger

1558
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,600
stack of bluetooth there's some cool

1559
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,720
devices coming down the road

1560
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,400
[Music]

1561
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,679
um i know mqt is on the roadmap of tom

1562
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:16,960
and that's definitely what i'm looking

1563
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:17,810
forward to too

1564
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:21,760
[Music]

1565
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,000
yeah i was i converted a couple mosquito

1566
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,880
demos to

1567
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,040
tcp just to make it work for me chain

1568
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:31,840
chat so yeah

1569
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,560
actually we got actually that's a good

1570
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,840
question for daryl when are we going to

1571
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,360
do events back and forth darryl

1572
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,080
yeah i should mention we got darrell

1573
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,360
miller one of the machine chat

1574
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,679
developers on the chat with us too so

1575
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:51,040
we should unmute you hey hi sorry

1576
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,360
no i'm unmuted good yeah so there's

1577
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,960
actually um

1578
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,000
in about two months ago we

1579
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,560
released the ability to not only have

1580
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,080
notifications via text

1581
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,239
and email but you can also have an

1582
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:05,199
action

1583
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:08,320
a custom action so you can basically

1584
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,560
have it go off and run a

1585
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,199
python script or a c program or whatever

1586
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,920
your fancy is on the raspberry pi

1587
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:19,199
and uh you know you can actually

1588
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,520
turn lights on or off indicators send

1589
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:24,080
messages

1590
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,320
so that works well there's some examples

1591
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:30,080
up on the support side of how to do that

1592
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,760
yep it could be another fun one to do

1593
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,679
daryl's have it talk back and forth for

1594
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:37,840
the esp32 blink some lights and like

1595
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,800
the perfect next workshop yeah yeah

1596
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,520
like i mentioned you robert i'm i'm

1597
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,440
fooling around with laura so i have some

1598
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:48,639
applications i want to

1599
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,560
want to do with laura so we'll be

1600
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,320
posting that info when

1601
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,480
when i have that ready yes that'll be

1602
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,760
great for a lot of

1603
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,600
areas where they have tons of devices in

1604
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,000
the field low data bandwidth

1605
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,760
you want to see it i always think about

1606
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,600
the gas the gas pumps

1607
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,639
in the out in north dakota or in texas

1608
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:09,840
to use laura

1609
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,719
just saying thank you for everyone for

1610
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,920
joining us i know i wish we'd all be in

1611
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,360
like we did all the years past in

1612
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,120
pasadena and be

1613
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:30,080
just soldering all night and just

1614
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,000
testing different ideas

1615
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:32,880
it's kind of sad we have to do this

1616
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,280
remotely but we should all be doing the

1617
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,000
solder challenge

1618
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,040
now actually

1619
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,719
if we hadn't been able to do this i

1620
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:42,719
wouldn't be able to attend so i'm

1621
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:45,360
grateful that there was a remote option

1622
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,360
unfortunately it's everyone's option

1623
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,159
yeah sadly it's everyone's option but

1624
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:52,239
maybe we could add virtual to the the

1625
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:55,040
regular workshop magenta

1626
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,920
yeah definitely i think um i think

1627
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:58,800
there's

1628
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,480
a lot of ways we'll be able to expand

1629
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,159
sort of accessibility for

1630
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:03,840
future super cons now that we've done it

1631
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,520
we have no excuse right

1632
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,880
exactly and then some of us are running

1633
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,080
around to all the

1634
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,520
volunteers and helpers and helping

1635
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,800
people it's like oh and then virtually

1636
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,080
how do you do it but

1637
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,880
right no i think you guys did an awesome

1638
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,239
job thank you

1639
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:21,360

in the bin and like oh there's my old

1650
