[Music]

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,200
thanks for tuning in

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,519
uh to emoticon i know it's a little bit

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,040
different than we've ever done anything

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,639
before but i think it's going pretty

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,599
well so far

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,360
and uh i like the fact that we're uh

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,039
we're actually getting people in

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,119
from all over the world i think uh i

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,480
think we heard somebody from brazil

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,320
before so that's nice

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,800
um this is the introduction of modular

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,199
synthesis using vcv rack with jonathan

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,160
foote

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,320
uh i'm dan maloney i'm a staff writer

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,679
here at hackaday i'm going to be

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,880
uh mc moderator um

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,399
uh kind of person for for this uh period

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,000
um as far as jonathan goes uh his bio

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
here says he's a recovering scientist

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,120
which i can relate to being one myself

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,200
lapsed musician which i can't relate to

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,160
because i

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,559
don't have any musical talent whatsoever

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,160
and an electrical engineer from san

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,920
francisco

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,600
understanding the principles of analog

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,079
synthesis helped him study for his phd

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,600
in signals analysis

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,120
one of his qualifications for running

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,199
this workshop is that he has played with

32
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,040
analog since he has played analog

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,560
synthesizers in front of paying

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,840
audiences so he's got

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
us all beat most likely so everybody

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,119
welcome jonathan foote and we'll get on

37
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,000
with the

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,320
show

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,479
hi everybody i'm john um thanks for

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,159
coming i'm really stoked you could join

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,040
me here

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,080
um couple things before we start um

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,720
uh first of all no pressure but if you

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,320
want to share your video just

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,880
just to see everybody who's here um the

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
hackaday people have made this nice

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,360
community

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,640
and it's been so tough in this um in

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,799
quarantine just to feel like you're with

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,399
other people so here we are with other

51
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,119
people

52
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,680
and a big thanks to dan a big thanks to

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
sophie and the hackaday team

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,439
everybody for putting us all together in

55
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,119
the same place

56
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,320
um and um uh another

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,439
uh uh another couple things i'm coming

58
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,360
to you from san francisco

59
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,479
and uh uh my neighbors are very keen on

60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,479
fireworks so as the um

61
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,479
as the sun goes down we might hear some

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,919
explosions in the distance that's

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,959
totally normal

64
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,400
and uh probably to be expected um

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,720
and also i know it's been a long week

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,840
for a lot of us

67
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,560
um if for any reason you're not

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,480
following it i'm talking too much it's

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,239
not interesting it's not boring you have

70
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,840
a party to go to maybe you're just

71
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
burned out and need a nap

72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
you can peace out at any time there's

73
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,080
zero shame

74
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,480
okay a lot of this is pretty technical

75
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,200
and i

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,720
realize if you're just kind of out of

77
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,200
brain cells for the moment

78
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,680
so um if there are questions you can ask

79
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
them in the chat

80
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,440
i've dropped a couple things in the chat

81
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,800
i'm going to be driving this thing

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,959
called vcv rack you can download it you

83
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,959
can follow along or you can just watch

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,000
me i don't know what's going to be

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,720
easier

86
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,920
or less taxing or more fun maybe if you

87
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,760
understand the principles you don't even

88
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
need me like as long as you understand

89
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
there's vcv rack you can download it and

90
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,800
play with it and

91
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
um they're probably some tutorials on

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,440
youtube that are better than me

93
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
so um it's all good all right

94
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,080
um with that let's get started

95
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,800
okay um i'm just gonna share my screen

96
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
with vcv rack i'm gonna make sure we can

97
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
all hear the noises that are going on

98
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,480
i have a couple slides i'm gonna be

99
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,159
bouncing to back and forth but mostly

100
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,360
we're gonna see vcd rack

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,799
um okay let me see if i can

102
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,080
play the button push the buttons here

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,760
first thing you need to know is you need

104
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
to select an audio output and you do

105
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
that through this menu here on the right

106
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,640
let me zoom out

107
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,879
control so you can see all the way on

108
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,599
the right here

109
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,680
almost on the way on the right is the

110
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,720
audio output

111
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,200
and you need to select your devices and

112
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,480
here i'm using my speakers

113
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,720
okay all right so if you've got vcv

114
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,360
running and um it is now using the

115
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,799
keyboard

116
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,280
on my laptop or on your laptop or on

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,840
your

118
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,480
system as a musical keyboard if you

119
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,239
press z

120
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
you should get a note okay so

121
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,600
um that's the basics that's

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,639
that's kind of how it works um and uh

123
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,160
we're gonna learn about what all these

124
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,919
little knobs and um

125
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,600
switches and these wires do

126
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,520
all right so um this is a uh

127
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,000
this is a way of generating music that's

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
called subtractive synthesis

129
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,440
and um let me just switch to a um

130
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,880
to a slide for a second here

131
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,280
okay

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,080
all right so um i think we're all kind

133
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,000
of got an engineering bent or maybe

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,680
a little kind of um technical uh

135
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,560
have our technical hat on so um this is

136
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
kind of a block diagram

137
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,400
of what we're seeing um or will be

138
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,120
seeing

139
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,639
in the um in the vcv rack okay we have a

140
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,600
keyboard which

141
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
generates a control voltage the control

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,199
voltage and i

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,160
apologize for all the um acronym solid

144
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,600
but that's just how this thing

145
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,160
is this is how it works um so um

146
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
vco stands for voltage controlled

147
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,199
oscillator

148
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,759
and this generates a tone that you

149
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,960
operate on with the

150
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,520
filter it's the also voltage controlled

151
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,039
so it's called a voltage controlled

152
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,919
filter

153
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,000
and then this goes into a voltage

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
controlled amplifier which can make it

155
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
make it louder or softer and all these

156
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,000
things are controlled by control

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,759
voltages which are generated by

158
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,639
different things

159
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,039
like a low frequency oscillator this

160
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,960
generates a control voltage to control

161
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,120
the the audio oscillator

162
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,280
and these are envelope generators also

163
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
called adsrs for attack

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,680
decay sustain and release and we'll talk

165
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,120
about all these

166
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,039
one at a time so let's start with the

167
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,960
voltage controlled oscillator

168
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,599
and so i'm going to switch back

169
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,360
okay and so you can see corresponding to

170
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,000
that

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,440
block diagram we have the voltage

172
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,199
controlled oscillator the vco

173
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,360
here and this is going into a voltage

174
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,960
controlled frequency

175
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,759
uh sorry voltage controlled filter the

176
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,000
output of that

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
goes into an amplifier in the mixer and

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,919
the output of that goes to your speakers

179
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,280
or to your audio device or your

180
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,120
headphones so you can hear them

181
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,639
okay so let's zoom in on the

182
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,880
voltage-controlled oscillator

183
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,199
okay

184
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,240
let me see okay so this has a number of

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,520
knobs and dials to the big knob and um

186
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,039
i need to apologize here um in that

187
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,160
this program um when um

188
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,400
uh when i'm adjusting a knob the pointer

189
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,680
disappears so it's not

190
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,360
obvious what i'm doing so i'm going to

191
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
try and make it very obvious

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,319
what i'm poking at when i poke at it so

193
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,039
right now

194
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,039
i'm just going to play a note and i'm

195
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,319
going to change this

196
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,080
frequency knob and you can hear how this

197
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,199
changes the frequency

198
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,240
turn it up turn it down but we'll just

199
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,880
let it sit in the middle there um and

200
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,039
here's a fine frequency adjustment

201
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,080
does the same thing but

202
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,090
this is good for tuning

203
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,529
[Music]

204
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
once again i'm adjusting the fine knob

205
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,000
here

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,319
all right and these things here these

207
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,800
are now wires these are patch cords

208
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,360
um in the old days if you these are

209
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,919
exactly like um analog synthesizer patch

210
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,120
cords except analog

211
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
synthesizer patch cords every problem

212
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,800
you've ever had with your headphone

213
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,599
patch cords

214
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,440
you can have these multiplied by the

215
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,280
number of patch cords you have

216
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,160
they go bad they go wonky sometimes they

217
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,840
don't work sometimes they don't plug all

218
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,360
the way in

219
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,639
but here and uh when you're doing analog

220
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,800
synthesizer you almost always run out of

221
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,960
patch cords but here these are infinite

222
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,479
and these are um these are

223
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,400
they're perfect they never go bad they

224
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,960
always work

225
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,479
so um these are jacks

226
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,400
on the bottom here these round double

227
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,960
circles here the white ones are input

228
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,599
jacks

229
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,080
and voltages go into them and the black

230
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,719
ones are

231
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,599
output jacks you can't this won't let

232
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:37,919
you

233
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,599
connect two outputs together because

234
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,599
usually nothing good happens with that

235
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,800
on an analog synthesizer um

236
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,320
that's not the case you can definitely

237
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
plug two outputs together and that's not

238
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,920
recommended

239
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,839
i should say that if you're interested

240
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,519
in analog synthesizers

241
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,240
this is a great way to get started with

242
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,120
this program

243
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,160
um if you're interested in eurorack

244
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,720
synthesizers in particular a lot of

245
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,519
eurorack

246
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,160
manufacturers make um

247
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
versions software versions of their

248
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
modules that you can drop

249
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,080
into this and um and uh experiment with

250
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,839
okay so i should mention that these are

251
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,839
all kind of modules that are all

252
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,399
um kind of standalone things and you can

253
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,160
mix and you can match them

254
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,959
and you can plug and you can unplug them

255
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:27,440
um

256
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,959
so right now this is the output of the

257
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,519
um voltage-controlled oscillator the

258
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,360
oscillator going to the input of the

259
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,000
frequent

260
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,480
of the filter so this is just this thing

261
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,920
this patch cord right here

262
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,240
and you can grab it and i can unplug it

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,600
and if i unplug it

264
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,880
nothing happens if i play a note there's

265
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,040
no sound coming out because we have not

266
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,360
taken the output we've broken this so

267
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,720
when you're doing this

268
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,360
uh it's very easy to get to a point

269
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,920
where

270
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,800
um nothing's working no sounds are

271
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,519
coming out

272
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,200
not the sounds you wanted to are coming

273
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
out so you do have to spend a little bit

274
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,079
of time

275
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,279
with your debugging hat on um if you're

276
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,480
a computer programmer

277
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,399
or your electrical engineer you're used

278
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,079
to working like like this with your

279
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,279
debugging hat on

280
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,959
if you're not that may take a little

281
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,360
getting used to but um

282
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,640
here's a pro tip um uh at least during

283
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,720
the workshop if you ever get stuck

284
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
and things aren't working like you want

285
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,000
to you can

286
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
basically pull the rip cord go up to the

287
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,120
file menu

288
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,440
um say new and this will just regenerate

289
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,839
that

290
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,120
basic patch that it started with

291
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,320
and that will make sure that you undo

292
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,920
any changes that you made all right

293
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,120
so um let's hook up that patch cord

294
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,000
again so click

295
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,240
on the sawtooth and can just drag it to

296
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,839
the input of the filter

297
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,279
and that's now connected again so

298
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,800
hopefully when i press a key i'm going

299
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,240
to press the z

300
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,800
we have a note here and a couple

301
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,000
switches here

302
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,320
this is analog digital the digital gives

303
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,120
you a little

304
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,920
cleaner digital looking waveform what's

305
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
really cool is it this is hooked up to

306
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,600
the oscilloscope here so we can see the

307
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,800
waveform

308
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,519
and um you can see the the frequency

309
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,320
change

310
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,000
the peaks of the waveform will get

311
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,519
closer together if we increase the

312
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,399
frequency

313
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,600
if i hit q that's an octave up so

314
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,720
that is double the number of um of

315
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,079
uh waves per time so that's twice the

316
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,560
frequency

317
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,839
all right so if i wanted just to get a

318
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,490
little um

319
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,920
[Music]

320
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,120
vibrato in here i could just play

321
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,360
and i could take this fine thing i could

322
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,450
just wobble that

323
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,640
[Music]

324
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,079
just get a little vibrato going in there

325
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,720
okay but let me introduce you to the

326
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,600
beauty of

327
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,399
control voltages and this is bob moog's

328
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,600
basic innovation

329
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
realizes that anything that you can turn

330
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,880
with a knob

331
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,959
you can turn with a control voltage and

332
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,000
a lot of all these

333
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,200
um modules uh create control voltages so

334
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,600
let's

335
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,200
add a um a what's called a low frequency

336
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,040
oscillator and this is a little module

337
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,000
that gives you

338
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,200
an uh a changing uh

339
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,360
voltage output which we can use to

340
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,639
control the voltage controlled

341
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,519
oscillator

342
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,800
so we can use it to control the

343
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,480
frequency of that to give it a little

344
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,519
vibrato

345
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,680
okay so i'm going to zoom out and i'm

346
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,880
going to show you

347
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
um how to add a module what you do is

348
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,600
you right click and this gives you a bit

349
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,279
i'm going to do this it's going to give

350
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,800
you a big menu

351
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,959
of all the possible modules that you can

352
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,279
have now these are the stock modules

353
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,279
if you go to vcv rack and you make a um

354
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,519
you make an account there's hundreds if

355
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,760
not thousands of other modules including

356
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,839
custom modules including modules that

357
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,360
look like other people's

358
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,440
um uh hardware eurorack modules that you

359
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,360
can actually spend money on and buy the

360
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,920
hardware and hook them together

361
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
okay so i'm going to add a voltage

362
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,959
controlled oscillator which is

363
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,120
the um i'm sorry the low frequency

364
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,720
oscillator which is here kind of in the

365
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,320
middle of the top

366
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,760
top thing so i'm just going to click on

367
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,680
that and that's put it down

368
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,120
on the bottom of the rack because i'm

369
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,519
zoomed out here

370
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,040
all right okay so this has a number of

371
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,320
control knobs too

372
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
and this um uh this the voltage

373
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
controlled oscillator is primarily for

374
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,560
audio

375
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,839
um audio uh range signals and the low

376
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,600
frequency oscillator is for lower

377
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,240
frequency

378
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
you can see how fast it's going it's

379
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
blinking this pseudo led

380
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,639
by how fast it's going and it's also got

381
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,399
a frequency knob i can turn it up and

382
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,440
you can see that's

383
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,000
blinking faster or or make it slower

384
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,839
okay so what i'm going to do now is i'm

385
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,199
going to patch this

386
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,440
so the low frequency oscillator is

387
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,480
controlling

388
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
the frequency of the vco

389
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,240
and it's got an input here called fm for

390
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,760
frequency modulator

391
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,720
modulation so i'm going to take the um

392
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,600
sine wave output of this

393
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,199
yeah actually let me i'm going to use

394
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,680
the square wave sqr stands for square

395
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,560
wave

396
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,160
output and i'm going to hook that up to

397
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,800
the frequency modulation input

398
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,639
okay and now when i hold down a key

399
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,639
nothing's going to happen until i turn

400
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,920
up this knob

401
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,040
which patches this control voltage input

402
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,120
to the actual frequency generation

403
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,519
stuff so if i'm going to give that a

404
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,399
little bit of a

405
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,079
a goose there take it off from

406
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,880
seven or eight o'clock where it was and

407
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,959
you can hear this

408
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,639
now changing the frequency

409
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
and it's doing it at a square wave so

410
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,399
it's doing it in discrete

411
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,680
um one zero uh increments now i can

412
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,719
increase this and get a larger change of

413
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
frequency

414
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,839
all right that's a good european siren

415
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,600
sound right there um

416
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,839
uh and i can also change the frequency

417
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,600
of the low frequency oscillator using

418
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,639
this knob down here

419
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,160
so so you just hear what that sounds

420
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,839
like faster

421
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,630
slower

422
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,279
[Music]

423
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,360
all right so um this is the fundamentals

424
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,639
of

425
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,639
voltage control synthesis where you can

426
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,880
use all these modules and a whole bunch

427
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,440
of them

428
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,000
and you can use the output of a of a

429
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,040
audio frequency oscillator to modulate

430
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,639
the frequency of another

431
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,720
audio frequency oscillator and that is

432
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,399
um that gives you some really

433
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,120
interesting

434
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,320
um um

435
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,399
frequency modulation sounds um

436
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,480
for instance i'm now going to change

437
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,680
this uh actually

438
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,199
before i do that i'm just going to turn

439
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,959
that i'm going to look at the various

440
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,680
outputs

441
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,000
of our voltage controlled oscillator so

442
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,399
right now this is a sawtooth

443
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,399
and you can see on the scope here and

444
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
let me zoom in a little bit

445
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,800
is this okay people um people seeing

446
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,759
things is this

447
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,160
too fast too slow people still with me

448
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,000
and once again if this is boring or too

449
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,199
much of me yakking

450
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,959
feel free to peace out at any time

451
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,279
i think it looks good so far okay good

452
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,399
good

453
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,240
um and we'll take a break um uh

454
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,880
uh in about 45 minutes and i'll i'll

455
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,639
take a couple little breaks so if people

456
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,000
are just playing along

457
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,240
uh you can uh twiddle some of the knobs

458
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,519
and just seeing um

459
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,399
see see how that works hey jonathan yes

460
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,199
sir

461
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,120
uh someone is just asking about um

462
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,399
vcv on a rack i'm sorry on a vcv rack on

463
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,040
a mac

464
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,880
with all the default settings was just

465
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,480
installed i can see the oscillator

466
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,279
moving but

467
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,000
um when the when i push keyboard buttons

468
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,480
but there's no sound coming out

469
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,759
okay i i can't not diagnose everything

470
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,320
but

471
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,839
one of the things you might need to do

472
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,759
is check your audio output and there's a

473
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,119
menu here

474
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,039
um it's going to be different on a mac

475
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,799
because this is a mac but i'm running

476
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,919
windows boo hiss there's a menu here

477
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:12,720
which says

478
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,439
which audio device you want output and

479
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,000
hopefully

480
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,439
that will do the right thing on the

481
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,400
macintosh and if there are any um

482
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,039
mac enthusiasts that can help uh with

483
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,240
some advice

484
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,720
on the chat that'd be great looks like

485
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,319
people are pitching in on the chat so i

486
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,280
think we'll be good

487
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,600
awesome thank you that was it thanks yep

488
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,880
great great

489
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,240
oh hey somebody's actually paying

490
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,080
attention all right so um if you're

491
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,360
joining us if you're joining us

492
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,679
late thank you for joining the workshop

493
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,880
here um

494
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,960
a lot of material i realize it's been a

495
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,400
long week um

496
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,799
and uh thank you i hope this is fun and

497
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,919
cool and

498
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
uh i i'm stoked to share this with you

499
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,039
um

500
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,360
all right so let's go back to the

501
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,039
oscillator because that has a number of

502
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,960
outputs that has four of these outputs

503
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,600
here

504
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,640
um the sawtooth uh

505
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,880
you can play a note look it on the scope

506
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,400
and guess why that's called a

507
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,280
sawtooth all right let's change i'm

508
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,360
going to unplug the sawtooth here

509
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,919
and plug in the square wave maybe zoom

510
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,400
in a little bit so you can see that and

511
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,640
play a note and hey that's a square wave

512
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,720
and note how it sounds different

513
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,120
sounds it has a different timbre from

514
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,000
the sawtooth

515
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,280
let's go back to the sawtooth

516
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,559
and go to the square wave okay

517
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,320
now here's a fun thing you can do which

518
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,640
is um two more of these knobs

519
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,880
on the voltage controlled oscillator you

520
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,960
can change the pulse width of the square

521
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,760
wave

522
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,520
if you're an engineer this is pulse

523
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,679
width modulation and you can change the

524
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,080
duty

525
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,760
cycle and the scope makes it pretty

526
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,120
clear what's happening

527
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,200
when we twiddle this knob so let's

528
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,640
change the pulse width and see what

529
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
happens

530
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,760
so that that really changes the harmonic

531
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,799
content

532
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,960
of the of the notes we're getting from

533
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,080
the oscillator

534
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,400
and it's really good to have a lot of

535
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,160
harmonic content

536
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,039
you can have the sine wave output

537
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,880
typically that's not used very much

538
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,440
because that just gives you a sine wave

539
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,160
and that doesn't do much in the filter

540
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,360
or any of the upstream stuff

541
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,400
it's a very very pure pure note

542
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,200
um to actually get some nice synthesizer

543
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,480
sounds you want to start with a

544
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,840
harmonically rich

545
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,880
um content like the sawtooth or the

546
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,679
square tooth

547
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,799
square wave or you take that square wave

548
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,320
all the way down make it narrow make a

549
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,920
pulse

550
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,440
[Music]

551
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,040
okay

552
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,039
[Music]

553
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,360
and um those all sound different because

554
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,120
they have different uh harmonic

555
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,080
content um yeah let me let me just

556
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,559
switch

557
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,720
quickly to a slide i have a couple

558
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,320
slides um

559
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,840
illustrate a couple of the principles

560
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,240
here um

561
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,280
give me a second here

562
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,400
okay all right

563
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,960
um hopefully people can see this uh this

564
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,799
diagram

565
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,880
okay we're using subtractive synthesis

566
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,200
and the way that works is you start with

567
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,320
a harmonically rich waveform

568
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,440
like we're getting out of the

569
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,000
voltage-controlled oscillator the vco

570
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,480
and you put that into a filter and that

571
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,280
removes

572
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,400
or accentuates some of the harmonics and

573
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,240
then that gives you kind of a richer

574
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,559
more interesting frequency output

575
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,559
and a lot of instruments in the human

576
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,320
voice work this way

577
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,880
um the human voice you start with this

578
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,559
kind of very buzzy

579
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,919
um signal from your vocal cords um uh

580
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,320
people can put tiny microphones down

581
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,919
your vocal tract while you're speaking

582
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,120
and it's kind of this

583
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,039
um terrifying darth vader buzzy buzzy

584
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:57,840
sound

585
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
and then what that happens is that it

586
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,080
gets filtered by your vocal tract which

587
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
has the resonant cavities in your mouth

588
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,200
and your nose

589
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,559
um and smooths off some of the buzziness

590
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,640
and gives the characteristic vowels the

591
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,480
ahs and the ease

592
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,520
and then the final output um

593
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,600
is the uh is your speaking voice your

594
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,840
vowels and a lot of um

595
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,960
a lot of uh uh acoustic instruments work

596
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
the same way too you start with

597
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
an excitation voltage and a brass

598
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,000
instrument that you're

599
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,240
kind of buzzing your lips or a clarinet

600
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,360
it's a reed

601
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,320
um and it goes through uh a resonant

602
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,880
cavity

603
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,200
like the body of a violin or the body of

604
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,280
a guitar which kind of shapes

605
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,080
this um this uh this initial um

606
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,520
excitation waveform and it smooths it

607
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,080
out and accentuates some frequency and

608
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,159
filters out some others so you get a

609
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,720
more interesting more musically valid

610
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,400
um output and um uh

611
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
a really great way to think about this

612
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,880
is in the frequency domain so you start

613
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,600
with

614
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,799
a um uh with an excitation signal that

615
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,880
has a lot of high frequency components

616
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,240
if it's a square wave

617
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,720
it looks like this i think one over f

618
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,000
one over f squared

619
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,480
i can't remember but in school at some

620
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
point they made me calculate the fourier

621
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,520
transform

622
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,080
of a of a sawtooth wave and you got all

623
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,760
these nice harmonics

624
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,200
and what you do is you put that into the

625
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,960
filter and that's our voltage controlled

626
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,480
filter which we'll be talking about

627
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,200
really soon and that will filters out

628
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,640
some of the harmonics or lets you

629
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
accentuate some other harmonics

630
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,400
and that gives you kind of a more

631
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,720
interesting musically valid

632
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,000
um sound on the output all right

633
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,280
just to remind everybody of

634
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,440
jean-baptiste fourier in 1740 whatever

635
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,679
proved that you can make a square wave

636
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,080
just by adding up a bunch of sine waves

637
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,240
and you can do the same thing with a

638
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
sawtooth

639
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
or something here's a here's a square

640
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,679
wave and you

641
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,240
add up a whole bunch of sinusoids and

642
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,480
the more sinusoids you add

643
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,799
the more it looks like a square wave and

644
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,400
these are the amplitudes of the sine

645
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,760
waves notice there's no

646
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,720
even uh harmonics just the odd ones and

647
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,280
if you do

648
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,840
the math of the actual uh fourier

649
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,919
transform that's what you get

650
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,080
and so these are these are harmonics

651
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
these are uh musicians sometimes call

652
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,200
them partial

653
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,960
if you play a guitar you know you can

654
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,200
pick a harmonic out on the string just

655
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,159
by putting

656
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,240
uh putting your finger on the middle

657
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,840
fret and damping out

658
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,200
um damping out the fundamental um so

659
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,240
these are our marble that we're gonna

660
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,880
chip

661
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,200
into a beautiful musical sculpture using

662
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,159
the filter

663
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,039
so it's good to start out with a very

664
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,520
rich

665
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,840
um rich harmonic content and here's some

666
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,159
uh harmonic content of the various

667
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,520
things we can get

668
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,679
from our voltage-controlled oscillator

669
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:58,960
you can get the sine wave

670
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,320
and that's a little boring because that

671
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,400
doesn't have any high frequencies

672
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,760
there that's just got the pure

673
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,200
fundamental um

674
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,600
the square wave has the odd harmonics

675
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,440
the triangular wave has

676
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,600
odd harmonics but they go down quicker

677
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,720
the sawtooth wave

678
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
has lots of juicy harmonics and if you

679
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,320
make a pulse wave it has even more

680
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,039
harmonics and those change depending on

681
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:23,520
the

682
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,640
pulse width of your pulse

683
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,240
so let's go back to our vcv rack

684
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,760
and you can hear how these things are

685
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,240
different so once again here's a square

686
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,320
wave and this sounds to my ears you can

687
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,240
kind of imagine it's like a clarinet

688
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,400
the clarinet has the read it's either on

689
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,080
or off it gives you this kind of

690
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,120
uh the read is either open or closed

691
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,678
captioning not

692
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:57,139
[Music]

693
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,520
one more available um and this is a

694
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,640
little pro tip

695
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,159
um remember how uh i could use the low

696
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,919
frequency oscillator let me zoom out a

697
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:08,720
little bit

698
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,320
uh if i turn up the um control voltage

699
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,880
to get a little um turn up the frequency

700
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,919
here too

701
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,600
to get a little vibrato here

702
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,960
yeah let me let me change this now to a

703
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,919
um

704
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,120
to a a triangle wave

705
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,799
all right maybe that's a little too much

706
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,640
i'm going to take down the modulation

707
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,039
the frequency modulation a little bit

708
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,320
and i'm going to

709
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,520
bring up the frequency a little bit

710
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,279
so that's a little bit of vibrato you

711
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,200
can imagine an opera singer

712
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,720
um doing that or if you're playing the

713
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,880
theremin you wobble your fist

714
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,919
near the um you're the uh antenna to get

715
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,039
this

716
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,960
get a little bit of um frequency

717
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,159
modulation

718
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,320
but let's do some pulse width modulation

719
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,360
okay so i'm going to

720
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,120
unplug the frequency modulation i'm

721
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,880
going to plug this into the pulse width

722
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,159
modulation

723
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,360
and um once again this knob

724
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,559
now that controls how much this

725
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,320
oscillator is controlling the pulse

726
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,080
width i'm going to turn it down so you

727
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,120
can hear what it's doing

728
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,080
i need to turn this up whoops

729
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,720
oh yes i also need to listen to the

730
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,080
square wave which is the actual

731
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,520
pulse wave so you can see how that's

732
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,080
changing with time

733
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,880
and that gives you a kind of a nice um

734
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,279
nice

735
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,679
uh time time varying a little richer

736
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,120
tone

737
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,720
um and uh uh here's uh here's a pro tip

738
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,679
if we turn up

739
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,430
the frequency a lot

740
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,200
[Music]

741
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,120
we get these inharmonic stuff this is

742
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,880
kind of the rave hoover sound so if you

743
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,240
want to be the rude

744
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,080
so that is uh that's a classic um

745
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,440
electro rave hoover

746
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,559
sound which is um pulse width modulation

747
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,000
at a pretty high frequency

748
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,760
how we doing on time okay it's been half

749
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,919
an hour let's take just a short break

750
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,720
and people can

751
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,159
play um play play around with things and

752
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,799
uh when we come back in like just two or

753
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,320
three minutes super short

754
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,880
we will um we will do the filter and

755
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,480
that's kind of where the magic happens

756
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,679
at the synthesizer

757
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,880
um but uh feel free to plug and

758
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,000
patch and twiddle some knobs okay

759
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,200
so back in like three minutes

760
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,960
and that will give me a chance to also

761
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,960
check the comments

762
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,559
we have a request to zoom out a little

763
00:27:50,559 --> 00:28:02,000
bit to show yes

764
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,520
yeah if you could favor a little bit to

765
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,919
the left because uh a lot of us have the

766
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:06,240
uh

767
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,720
gallery view sort of on the right there

768
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,279
and it's brick

769
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,440
it's blocking things how how close to

770
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,840
a hardware setup is this gonna look

771
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,080
um if you get i'm not sure you can buy

772
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,520
this actual hardware but this

773
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,880
is very similar if you buy a mini moog

774
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,399
or um a lot of uh

775
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,320
eurorack things will work very very

776
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,200
similarly so

777
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,200
i think that's the most important thing

778
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,640
i've learned so far is the correct

779
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,840
pronunciation of moog

780
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,520
all right i've always assumed it was

781
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,120
just moog

782
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,919
yeah i think it's moog i think it's mode

783
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,880
i think you're right yeah

784
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,720
okay so a little uh little uh sidebar

785
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,919
here

786
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,799
so in order to get a rich sur sound you

787
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,919
can stack

788
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,120
these um oscillators and uh

789
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,039
uh because if they're analog oscillators

790
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:11,679
are never

791
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,799
at precisely the exact frequency um you

792
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,559
can um

793
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,640
you can uh get a little bit of richer

794
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,159
sound by adding in a couple of

795
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,440
oscillators and

796
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,600
wendy carlos for switched on box she

797
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,799
used um

798
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,960
six of the mode voltage control

799
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,159
oscillators um

800
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,640
there's a guy on youtube who uh hooked

801
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,240
up a thousand of them

802
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
and it sounds pretty dope as you might

803
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,520
imagine it sounds

804
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,720
it sounds very very fat but um if you're

805
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,320
not used to um

806
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,159
analog synthesizers you only get one

807
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,520
note at a time

808
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,559
um and without a little bit of reverb or

809
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,000
a little bit of delay and i'll show you

810
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,120
how to hook that up

811
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,159
um it can sound a little bit thin so

812
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,200
um and uh all this stuff

813
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,880
you need to um uh understand that uh

814
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,720
this is uh this is a musical instrument

815
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,799
takes a little practice and uh

816
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,880
understanding to get to know how to use

817
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,360
so hopefully i can give you the pointers

818
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,279
to get some sounds out of it but to be a

819
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,880
paganini you'll take some practice

820
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,559
all right um let's move on to the filter

821
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,080
and the filter is kind of where the

822
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,240
magic happens and this is the

823
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,399
how you get some of those very very

824
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,559
classic classic synthesizer

825
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,080
um sounds and what the filter does

826
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,039
is you might imagine by the name it's uh

827
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,240
filtering out

828
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,440
harmonics it's um it's a frequency uh

829
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,520
dependent filter that lets some

830
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,880
frequencies through

831
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,360
and cuts some frequencies out and um

832
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,840
this uh this big knob changes the

833
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,080
frequency

834
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,279
and um uh right now it's set all the way

835
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:53,760
down

836
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
because it's being controlled by this

837
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
thing called the envelope generator

838
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,720
which we'll talk about in a couple

839
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,519
minutes

840
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,039
um okay right now

841
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,360
let's take down i'm going to take down

842
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,960
the control voltage so i'm going to

843
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,120
basically

844
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,000
remove the um influence of the envelope

845
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,880
generator

846
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,960
and this will just let me play with the

847
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,000
with the

848
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,600
filter by itself okay so um

849
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,320
i think that will do it now if i play

850
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,880
something

851
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,799
you won't hear anything that's because

852
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,640
the filter is all the way down it's

853
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,679
filtered out

854
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,840
all the frequencies but if i can turn it

855
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,200
up

856
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
might be able to see something yeah you

857
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,480
can see something on the scope

858
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,000
oh yeah let me turn down this annoying

859
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
pulse width modulation

860
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,080
i just so i just did that so goodbye ray

861
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,559
hoover

862
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,200
and as you turn up the frequency you

863
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,519
hear more and more high frequencies

864
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,160
so it gets brighter and crisper

865
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,229
[Music]

866
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,720
and this is the kind of classic synth

867
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,510
sound words which is a filter sweep

868
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,180
[Music]

869
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,840
okay so i'm just i'm just dragging this

870
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840
i'm just turning this knob

871
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,120
manually but once again we can use um

872
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,080
a free a low frequency oscillator i'm

873
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,000
going to take the um

874
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,679
unplug it from the pwm and

875
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,159
this is the frequency control input i'm

876
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,000
going to unplug the envelope generator

877
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,600
for now remind me i need to plug that

878
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,000
back in again

879
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,880
okay and i'm going to plug our low

880
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
frequency oscillator into the voltage

881
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,159
control frequency

882
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,200
so now um

883
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,120
you just go down and this is the

884
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,610
triangle wave output so you can hear

885
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,559
[Music]

886
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,559
i can i need to turn this up a little

887
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,720
bit

888
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,279
let me also turn down the the frequency

889
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,840
here

890
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,480
so now you can hear how the the um

891
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,679
the filter is changing over time and we

892
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,279
can make that higher

893
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,840
for a brighter sound where we can make

894
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,519
it lower

895
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,200
for a kind of warmer duller sound

896
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,960
and we can make it solo we filter out

897
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,480
all the sound completely

898
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,240
it's just gone it's quiet okay

899
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,399
so that's a low pass filter this is the

900
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,799
one you usually use because you usually

901
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,159
want the fundamental

902
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,320
but there's also a high pass filter so

903
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,000
let's listen to that

904
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,600
and this will be a lot brighter because

905
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,720
this is only letting the high

906
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,600
frequencies through

907
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,320
that's kind of cool and if we turn this

908
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,760
all the way down

909
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,039
it's a high pass filter so now

910
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,200
and i'm i apologize if that's too loud

911
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,519
let me take that down

912
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,320
here a little bit on the mixer now this

913
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,720
is

914
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,559
super bright super zingy super electric

915
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,960
and as we turn this up the high pass

916
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,720
filter we're removing more and more low

917
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,679
frequencies so we'll get even buzzier

918
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,519
and so all we're left is just the high

919
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,799
harmonics

920
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,639
just those crispy edges of the high

921
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,719
harmonics of this pulse width

922
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,159
let me turn up the pulse width here

923
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,520
okay so that's the high pass filter

924
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,079
let me um go back to the low-pass filter

925
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,119
and uh

926
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,130
uh do it here

927
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,560
[Music]

928
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,280
okay so this is kind of where the magic

929
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,119
happens or those classic analog

930
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,960
synthesizer sounds is in the

931
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,520
is in the um is in the uh voltage

932
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,320
control filter

933
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,639
and there's one more magic thing here

934
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,320
which is called the resonance and if

935
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,918
you're electrical engineer

936
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,719
you've seen this um as the q factor of a

937
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,599
filter

938
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,800
and um let me just show you what happens

939
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,639
when you trim this up what this does is

940
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,359
this

941
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,920
accentuates the peak around the filter

942
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,320
cut off and this lets you

943
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,960
basically not only cut out particular

944
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,839
frequencies that

945
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,760
lets you boost them too so i'm going to

946
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,460
turn this up and you can hear it

947
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,539
[Music]

948
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,480
let me turn up the volume here a little

949
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,839
bit too

950
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,599
yes sir the green cable on the vfc

951
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,480
or the vcf is that connected to the

952
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,400
triangle or to the square wave output of

953
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,200
the lfo

954
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
right now it's connected to the triangle

955
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,480
triangle okay thank you someone had a

956
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,440
question on that yeah that's a good one

957
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,160
that's a good one

958
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,000
okay so why wow

959
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,280
and um uh if you if you turn it up high

960
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,000
enough

961
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,079
it's gonna whistle it'll resonate

962
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,400
and um i'm gonna turn the volume down

963
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
because that can be really shrieking and

964
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,560
very loud because this thing is not

965
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,160
coming out of the oscillator this

966
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,000
this thing is coming out of the

967
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,440
that filter is the filter itself

968
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,200
oscillating

969
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,520
okay um let me quickly just show you a

970
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,880
picture of what's going on in the

971
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,480
frequency domain because that might make

972
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,440
it a little bit clearer

973
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,280
okay remember this is our raw materials

974
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,079
these uh

975
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,480
these uh high frequencies and their

976
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,960
partials

977
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,720
this is what the filter does you

978
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,040
basically multiply it by this

979
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,760
and this is um different amounts that

980
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,359
you've turned up the resonance if it's

981
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,720
got a low resonance

982
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,839
um it's got a very uh normal shoulder

983
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,680
it's got a very flat response if you

984
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,440
turn up that resonance

985
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,040
you get a little bit more peak at the

986
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,560
center frequency

987
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,560
so um the the um the resonance the q

988
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,680
knob is changing how peaky the filter is

989
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,079
and the big filter knob the big knob in

990
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:02,720
the center

991
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,640
is changing where where the center

992
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,640
frequency is in the frequency domain

993
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,000
here whoops i didn't mean to

994
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,640
scroll but that kind of illustrated it

995
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,280
so

996
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,359
those give you two things and if you

997
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,320
have the resonant

998
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,000
frequency turned up enough it more or

999
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,240
less looks like a bandpass filter

1000
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,680
because the low frequencies here are um

1001
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,320
are the high frequencies here are gone

1002
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,560
low frequencies here are not boosted

1003
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,400
but the center frequencies are boosted a

1004
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,680
lot so this is a

1005
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,320
this is a um this is essentially a

1006
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,839
bandpass filter

1007
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,560
and uh you can turn that up so it only

1008
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,200
the things

1009
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,200
in this bandpass are what you hear

1010
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,640
so let's go back to the rack

1011
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,040
and um this is this is really

1012
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,680
interesting

1013
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,280
because um you can use this as a

1014
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,800
i'm going to turn down the control

1015
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,680
voltage here

1016
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,920
actually i'm just going to unplug that

1017
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,100
completely so now we've got pretty high

1018
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,839
[Music]

1019
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,200
resonance

1020
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,599
and what you should be able to do is

1021
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,839
pick out the higher frequencies

1022
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,920
just by changing our frequency here so

1023
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,160
let me see if i can do that

1024
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,359
let me turn it up a little bit

1025
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,880
so there

1026
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,359
[Music]

1027
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,880
so that's the first harmonic you can

1028
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,839
hear it's an octave

1029
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:40,120
[Music]

1030
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,599
and then you go up to the harmonic

1031
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,240
sequence the harmonic series which is

1032
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,440
uh twice the the fundamental that's an

1033
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,960
octave three times the fundamental

1034
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,480
that's an octave and a fifth

1035
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,160
four times the oct the fundamental

1036
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,079
that's an octave of fifth and a third

1037
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,000
and so forth and so on and really

1038
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,359
interestingly

1039
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,320
pretty quickly it gets out of the um the

1040
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,640
12 tone scale so if you want some micro

1041
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,839
tones to play with

1042
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,760
um you can get them out of the harmonic

1043
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,040
series and they're all

1044
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,440
fundamentally um harmonically related to

1045
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,200
the fundamental which is that pitch

1046
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,240
that you're hearing um

1047
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,880
okay um so i think that's really cool

1048
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,680
that's a really

1049
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,000
kind of natural way to understand the

1050
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,359
harmonic series

1051
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,119
uh where you can actually pick them out

1052
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,000
using the bandpass filter

1053
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,760
to uh to kind of zero in on them

1054
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
but let's let's push on let's talk about

1055
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,440
the envelope generator

1056
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,160
okay so all this things have been kind

1057
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,599
of constant

1058
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,680
if things have been changing with time

1059
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,040
they've been changing

1060
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,200
using using these oscillators which just

1061
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,640
go back and forth

1062
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,640
so let's talk about the envelope

1063
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,599
generator too

1064
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,079
and that's called adsr here and that's

1065
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:56,640
for

1066
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,760
attack decay sustain and release

1067
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,839
so let's zoom out and look a little bit

1068
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,760
at the big picture now

1069
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,359
okay so in here on the far left here

1070
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,839
this is the midi slash control voltage

1071
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,520
thing this is generating

1072
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,079
from the keyboard it's generating a

1073
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,079
control voltage which controls the pitch

1074
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,359
of the oscillator

1075
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,720
this is also generating um a trigger

1076
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,920
and a gate these are these are basically

1077
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,839
digital signals and some

1078
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,640
uh synthesizers they're just ttl they're

1079
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:28,960
on

1080
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,400
off signals um the gate is high when you

1081
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,079
have a key pressed down

1082
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,680
and when you release the key the gate

1083
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,599
goes off

1084
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,680
so it's high when the key is down and

1085
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,760
it's low when the key is up

1086
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,400
and um you can hook that into the scope

1087
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,160
and watch that if you want to

1088
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,960
um but i think uh i think i'll just have

1089
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,920
you take my

1090
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,640
my word for it right now but right now

1091
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,440
that gate

1092
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,720
is plugged into the adsr

1093
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,319
and the trigger the rtrg this gives you

1094
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,599
a pulse every time a key is pressed

1095
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,040
and so the gate tells you when a key is

1096
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,839
down

1097
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,000
and the re-trigger gives you a pulse

1098
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,040
every time a key

1099
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,520
is pressed and what the adsr this is a

1100
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,960
little sequencer

1101
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,880
this is a little um finite state machine

1102
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,720
if you're an engineer

1103
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,560
and it's triggered by this trigger

1104
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,880
signal every time you press the key down

1105
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,839
it steps through these four steps attack

1106
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:28,480
decay

1107
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,000
sustain release all right so

1108
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
um if i press the button uh press a key

1109
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,480
um you should you should see it just

1110
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,000
walk right through let me

1111
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,040
let me um make things a little slower

1112
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,880
okay so this is a little weird it goes

1113
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,319
attack decay

1114
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,599
sustain release attack and decay are

1115
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,720
times they are durations

1116
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,920
um releases of duration one odd person

1117
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,520
out here is sustained

1118
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,880
this is a level um yeah let's let me see

1119
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,720
if i can actually plug this into the

1120
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,520
scope

1121
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,599
and i'll scooch over here so hopefully

1122
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:06,880
people can see this

1123
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,119
um

1124
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,160
and let's take the output

1125
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,720
of the of the adsr now this is generated

1126
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,560
a control voltage output

1127
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,680
not an audio output so um

1128
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,800
if you want to patch two things from the

1129
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
same output you hit control

1130
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,280
so i can hit control on the output and

1131
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,240
patch that

1132
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,319
into the x and i think i need to take

1133
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,400
down the time base of the scope

1134
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,960
now unfortunately this doesn't work like

1135
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,160
a trigger

1136
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,680
as you'd expect if you're used to

1137
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,920
oscilloscopes so uh you just got to get

1138
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,359
lucky to catch it

1139
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,640
um so we'll see um hear it okay good i

1140
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,720
got it

1141
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,560
so what's happening is it has a long

1142
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,200
attack

1143
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,920
it has a long decay the sustain is a

1144
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,400
level

1145
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,000
and it has a long release because all

1146
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
these knobs are up if i turn down the

1147
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,720
attack

1148
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,240
to very short let me see if i can catch

1149
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,000
it you can see it that attack is really

1150
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,880
short

1151
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,240
let me turn down the time base here

1152
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,119
okay if i increase the attack here you

1153
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,560
can see how it's slower

1154
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,480
on the attack let me catch it

1155
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
there we go and you can make it really

1156
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,200
slow so it kind of swoops up

1157
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,440
and you make it even slower so it really

1158
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,400
slowly swoops up

1159
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,440
all right and the decay is how quickly

1160
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,000
um

1161
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,480
it comes down after after it's after it

1162
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,599
hits the peak

1163
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,280
so i'm going to turn down the attack all

1164
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,520
the way so it's a quick attack

1165
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,480
and here we got a long decay let's make

1166
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,280
a short decay

1167
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,200
i got to catch it there we go

1168
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,560
so you can see it comes down quickly

1169
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,839
after it hits that peak or we can

1170
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,680
give it a long decay which means it'll

1171
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,399
come down slower

1172
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,079
there we go all right now like i said

1173
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:08,480
this

1174
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,760
third one is um and uh actually what's

1175
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,720
nice about this

1176
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,280
particular envelope generator is it you

1177
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:15,839
can see

1178
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,760
what stage you're in by these little

1179
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,880
indicator lights

1180
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,640
so if i make everything slow you can

1181
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,079
actually and you hit a key you can

1182
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,680
walk see it walk through the various

1183
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,870
stages

1184
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:29,280
[Music]

1185
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,560
attack decay sustain release

1186
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,960
now sustain is the level that it will

1187
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,960
hold while i'm holding down the key

1188
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,000
so if i turn this all the way down and i

1189
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,079
hold down the key

1190
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,640
all you hear is the attack and the decay

1191
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,079
so i'm going to make them both pretty

1192
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,359
short

1193
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,160
whoops too short

1194
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,760
so this is good for like pluck strings

1195
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,599
where you don't have a lot of decay

1196
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,520
but if you want an organ sound if you

1197
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,200
want a brass sound you want a little bit

1198
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,560
more sustain

1199
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,200
to hold that note while you're holding

1200
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,940
the key down

1201
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,319
[Music]

1202
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,520
and if you want to remove the decay

1203
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,200
completely you just turn the sustain all

1204
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,079
the way up

1205
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,920
and this is like a brass where it's loud

1206
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,839
and it doesn't really decay

1207
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,520
all right so if the sustain is all the

1208
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,400
way up

1209
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,480
this is the level then the decay doesn't

1210
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,720
matter and the release is how long it

1211
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,000
lasts when you

1212
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,560
pick up the key so if you want a nice

1213
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,680
bell tone

1214
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,079
um you can turn the sustain all the way

1215
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,319
down

1216
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,240
and turn up the release a little bit

1217
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,839
this will give you a xylophone

1218
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,440
or a plucked string if you turn it all

1219
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,640
the way up you get bells

1220
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,920
whoops i'm sorry the release only

1221
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,079
releases uh the level that

1222
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,160
it was at the sustain there we go

1223
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,839
so that's a really long release

1224
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,720
so if you want nice bell tones or

1225
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,359
marimbas or xylophones or gongs

1226
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,280
you'll you'll add in a little bit of bit

1227
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,040
of release

1228
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,720
here okay how are we doing on time we're

1229
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,800
45 minutes into it hopefully people are

1230
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,440
um

1231
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,160
people are doing okay um at the hour

1232
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,760
mark or a little bit before the hour

1233
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,040
mark we'll take a break

1234
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,440
you can do a bio break um hopefully

1235
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,040
people are sticking with this and this

1236
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,640
isn't going too fast

1237
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,760
um break is in sight um

1238
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
just a couple other things i want to

1239
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,200
show you before the break

1240
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
there is a there is a question in the uh

1241
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,319
in the chat if you want to take a look

1242
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:38,720
at that

1243
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,839
yeah yeah let me take a look at the chat

1244
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,680
where is the chat where'd my chat go

1245
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,640
there we go

1246
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:57,839
oh yes go over trigger gate um

1247
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:10,240
okay couple questions here um

1248
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,640
okay a question holding a key and

1249
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,359
pressing another doesn't reset the adsr

1250
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,119
is that because any all signals coming

1251
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,000
from midi cv count as on versus treating

1252
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,880
keys separately i think that is the case

1253
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,280
there

1254
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,640
is a um there is a uh

1255
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,960
vcv rack we'll do some polyphony in

1256
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,040
other words it will do multiple notes

1257
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,480
um from the um from the um

1258
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,440
uh midi input i'm not sure how that

1259
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,720
works from the keyboard

1260
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,359
a lot of computer keyboards are not set

1261
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,119
up for polyphony so you can't tell when

1262
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,079
you have two

1263
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,200
keyboard keys down like uh

1264
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,319
uh qwerty keys so um i think

1265
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,240
that's a little limitation just of the

1266
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,520
computer keyboards

1267
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,760
that you can't retrigger when you hit

1268
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,800
another key

1269
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,000
but this retrigger thing will give you a

1270
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,400
pulse

1271
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,480
every time you hit a key so the

1272
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,160
retrigger

1273
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,240
starts the sequence and what the gate

1274
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,520
does is it tells you

1275
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,040
how long to sustain so the gate will

1276
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,960
as long as the gate is held high

1277
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,839
you will be in sustain so i just hit a

1278
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,240
key

1279
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,599
i need to get back to um my screen share

1280
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,839
here

1281
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,240
there we go so you you can actually see

1282
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,680
how this works because of the little

1283
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,440
indicator lights as long as i hold down

1284
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,960
a key

1285
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,000
the gate light will be asserted it will

1286
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,240
be

1287
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,559
lit but i'll only get a little pulse

1288
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:39,839
from the re-trigger

1289
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,720
but every time you hit a key another key

1290
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,920
you'll see a little pulse

1291
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,800
on the retriever

1292
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,960
so hopefully that that that cleared that

1293
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,920
up and so

1294
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,200
so the the um the

1295
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,839
uh envelope generator needs both signals

1296
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:58,480
it need

1297
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,400
uses the retrigger to know when to

1298
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,920
trigger the state machine that just

1299
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,599
walks through the attack decay sustain

1300
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:04,079
release

1301
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,640
and it needs to know you use the gate to

1302
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,920
know how long

1303
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,079
to hold the sustain for to know when

1304
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,040
you're sustaining

1305
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,800
when you release the key the gate goes

1306
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,480
low and then you're

1307
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,280
into the release part of the the um of

1308
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,920
the state machine

1309
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,319
okay

1310
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,720
great okay um let me just show you two

1311
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,880
quick little tricks here um

1312
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,160
uh control out so if you're just

1313
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,000
noodling away with this

1314
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,440
um these sounds can be a little bit um

1315
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,960
a little bit um not compelling

1316
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,559
um if you're uh

1317
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,559
uh just playing along at home or

1318
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,040
something uh i really recommend adding a

1319
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,200
delay or a reverb it just makes a sound

1320
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:51,680
a little bit

1321
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,040
richer a little bit more

1322
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,359
lifelike um and to show you how to add

1323
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,000
the uh

1324
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,280
delay um uh let's talk a little bit

1325
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,000
about

1326
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,880
a final module which is the um uh

1327
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,640
voltage controlled amplifier

1328
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,599
now that's kind of hidden in this patch

1329
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,119
in the mixer it's built

1330
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,480
into the mixer and that's why

1331
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,079
the voltage-controlled oscillator is

1332
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,839
oscillating all the time

1333
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,559
the reason we can't we're not hearing it

1334
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:23,520
all the time

1335
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,040
is because we have the envelope

1336
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,200
generator plugged into

1337
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,119
a um voltage controlled amplifier that's

1338
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:31,839
in

1339
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,040
built into the mixer if i

1340
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,599
unplug it i'm going to turn the volume

1341
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,720
down here on the mixer

1342
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,760
and maybe zoom into that a little bit if

1343
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,920
i unplug that

1344
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,160
the control voltage of this amplifier

1345
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,280
then it's on all the time

1346
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,440
right and that's super annoying which is

1347
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,800
why i didn't do that

1348
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,000
okay so let's actually add in um

1349
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,559
a uh a module that's a voltage

1350
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,920
controlled amplifier because that's a

1351
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,000
handy thing to have

1352
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,400
let me just move some stuff around here

1353
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,079
so there's room for it

1354
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,200
and you can grab all these things and

1355
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,680
just

1356
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,839
move them around so what i'm going to do

1357
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,520
is i'm going to right click

1358
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,680
i'm going to add a vca a voltage

1359
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,000
controlled amplifier

1360
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,800
i'm going to use the output of the

1361
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,240
envelope generator

1362
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,000
and once again control gives you a

1363
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,200
another patch cord from an output that

1364
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,760
goes to the control voltage input

1365
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,079
um uh the output of our low pass filter

1366
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,839
instead of going into the mixer that's

1367
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:40,559
going to go

1368
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,240
to the input of our voltage controlled

1369
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,559
amplifier and now the output of our

1370
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,160
voltage controlled amplifier

1371
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,559
will go to the input of our mixer and i

1372
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:49,599
need to remember

1373
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,640
to turn up the mixer again now this is

1374
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,000
just duplicating

1375
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,079
the little voltage-controlled amplifier

1376
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,680
that's built into the mixer

1377
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,920
because you use it all the time they

1378
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,160
kind of made that a normal part of the

1379
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,480
process here so now hopefully if i've

1380
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,599
done this right

1381
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,960
we get our normal patch back okay

1382
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,040
but now since we have this one wire

1383
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,960
contains all our audio

1384
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,319
after the um uh

1385
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,880
after the amplifier we can now stick in

1386
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,559
some other things so let's stick in a

1387
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,720
delay

1388
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,520
all right so someplace here is a delay

1389
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,119
yeah right there on the top row

1390
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,160
is a delay okay

1391
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,640
and so now i'm going to take the output

1392
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,920
of the

1393
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,160
voltage controlled amplifier i'm going

1394
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,640
to put it into the delay

1395
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,079
um and i can uh take the output of the

1396
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:42,880
delay

1397
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,800
and put that back into our mixer so we

1398
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,480
can hear it

1399
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,680
okay and uh this is the mix

1400
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,119
um this is the color uh feedback and

1401
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,520
time if you use to delay pedals on a

1402
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,760
guitar um you're used to this and now

1403
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,559
let's

1404
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,240
uh play a note and that

1405
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,280
that gives us just a little bit more um

1406
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,720
uh more slap back we can increase the

1407
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,359
time

1408
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,640
of the echo and this is fun to play

1409
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,319
around with you can do

1410
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,570
polyrhythmic stuff

1411
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:18,999
[Music]

1412
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,079
or you can make that shorter for a

1413
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,800
little slapback echo

1414
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,960
increase the feedback

1415
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,119
sounds a little bit more like a reverb a

1416
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,400
little bit more like a room

1417
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,599
the color um uh rolls off the high

1418
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,680
frequencies like if you're in a

1419
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,640
absorbent room

1420
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,480
not sure how how um

1421
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,599
how um uh

1422
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,640
easy that is to hear um and the final

1423
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,000
knob here is the mix

1424
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,400
if you put that all the way wet all you

1425
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,240
get is reverb

1426
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,920
if you put out all the way dry all you

1427
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,280
get is the direct signal

1428
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,119
without any delay so this lets you mix

1429
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,880
in how much

1430
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,079
delay you actually want

1431
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,680
all right okay um let's take a little

1432
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,559
break let's take

1433
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,559
five minutes um um oh uh

1434
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,319
i think i need to feed my cap i will

1435
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,160
come back i will get to some questions

1436
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,119
in the chat

1437
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,400
um uh and uh in the next

1438
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,920
part of the um uh workshop we will

1439
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,280
do a little um drum machine and we'll uh

1440
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,520
play some more with triggers and gates

1441
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,319
and uh

1442
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:35,760
we'll use the resonance of the

1443
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,680
voltage-controlled filter and we'll do

1444
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,720
a craft fork snare and an 808 kick drum

1445
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,559
sound and put those all together with a

1446
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:43,599
sequencer

1447
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,160
and um and that should be fun but uh

1448
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,480
let's take a little break

1449
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,799
and i'll be back in five and um i'll

1450
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,400
check out the chat

1451
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,240
john can you just zoom out again so

1452
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,839
people can see your patch if they want

1453
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:56,799
to um

1454
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:00,000
yeah replicate it thank you all right

1455
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,200
see everybody in a couple minutes

1456
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,760
and we're back hello everybody thanks

1457
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,599
for sticking with us

1458
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,480
um i'm really stoked that everybody

1459
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,240
decided to join us for this

1460
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,040
um thanks again to the hackaday people

1461
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,640
for making a community

1462
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,359
um i hope this is interesting at least

1463
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,400
some people stuck

1464
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,760
stuck through it and once again i want

1465
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,440
to remind you that

1466
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,440
you're under no compunction to stick

1467
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,880
through this i know

1468
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,799
um on the east coast it's probably

1469
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,960
getting to be kind of party time

1470
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,119
or maybe you're um you're a little

1471
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,119
pooped from a long and stressful week

1472
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,640
for a lot of us if you need to take a

1473
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,280
nap

1474
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,160
um there's absolutely uh you can you can

1475
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,599
leave with my blessing

1476
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,799
um uh so anyway let's let's um

1477
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:48,160
let's move on okay um and uh

1478
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,160
thank you for all the comments in the

1479
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,520
chat there are some

1480
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,640
there are some great um

1481
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,200
there are some great links uh the

1482
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:57,839
fourier

1483
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,280
uh visualization from uh three blue one

1484
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,160
brown

1485
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,079
uh the um uh keith whitman fullerton's

1486
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,599
uh eurorack set up

1487
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,920
and you realize how nice it is to have

1488
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,920
virtual patch cords which are infinite

1489
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,520
and don't get on top of each other

1490
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,960
so you can still see what's going on

1491
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,000
so thanks everybody let me go back

1492
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,839
to our

1493
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,720
vcv rack something i forgot to mention

1494
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,599
this is all open source

1495
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,400
i've been meaning to work on the scope

1496
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,000
and actually make the trigger trigger

1497
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,760
like the scopes i'm used to

1498
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,839
if you right click on the um

1499
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,359
on the um on any particular

1500
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:46,559
module there's a

1501
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,480
plugin menu and you can go to the source

1502
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,920
code this will take you right to the

1503
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,799
github

1504
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:53,200
repository for the source code for that

1505
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,559
module so if you want to get into

1506
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,040
audio programming this is not a bad way

1507
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,000
to do this

1508
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,559
um to see how uh some of these modules

1509
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,160
work and they're kind of

1510
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,520
small and um modular uh so you only need

1511
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,880
to worry about one little bit of the

1512
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,359
whole thing at a time

1513
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,559
um okay uh let

1514
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,359
us um start from scratch here i'm just

1515
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,079
gonna

1516
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,000
uh go to file and i'm gonna go new

1517
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and uh to start from scratch uh

1518
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,359
i don't need to save this so i'm gonna

1519
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,040
say okay you might want to save yours

1520
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,440
okay and i need to remember to reset the

1521
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,720
audio to my

1522
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,920
um speakers so i can hear it

1523
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,079
and uh we'll start from scratch here and

1524
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:40,960
uh

1525
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,400
just do a little bit of um

1526
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,880
do a little bit of uh sanity checking

1527
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,760
i'm just gonna play

1528
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,720
a note i can hear that hopefully you can

1529
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,760
okay there's one one more um

1530
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,520
uh audio source that i didn't get to

1531
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,119
um in our first half and uh it's a noise

1532
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,440
source

1533
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,599
and that turns out to be surprisingly

1534
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,280
musically useful you don't think

1535
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,240
noise is actually that musical but um a

1536
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,359
lot of things

1537
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,760
have noisy components a lot of

1538
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,799
percussion

1539
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:22,240
um is not pitched um a lot of even

1540
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,119
pitched

1541
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,760
uh notes like a calliope has a little

1542
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,359
kind of steam chuff

1543
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:30,640
um when it's turning on

1544
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,960
when the note on the onset of the note

1545
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,880
so to get a little

1546
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,880
flute or calliope sound sometimes you'll

1547
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,799
just mix in a little bit of um

1548
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,839
white noise so let's let's um pull up

1549
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,760
a uh hang a sec let me move things

1550
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,359
around here

1551
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:51,839
oh wrong thing

1552
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,799
pardon me my thing has gone off the

1553
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,240
screen so i can't grab it

1554
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,640
i'm sure all right i'll just make do

1555
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,160
with what we got here

1556
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,520
um and uh

1557
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,040
thanks again to dan for running

1558
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,720
interference on the questions

1559
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,040
um don't have quite enough screen to

1560
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,760
have my

1561
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,240
chat and every all the controls up so i

1562
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,000
apologize if i'm missing things as they

1563
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,799
go by

1564
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:24,000
in the chat ah there we go got it

1565
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,680
okay um so let's add a noise source i'm

1566
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,880
gonna right click

1567
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,079
and uh someplace

1568
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,359
is the noise here it is on the second

1569
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:37,920
column almost all the way to the right

1570
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,040
um let me

1571
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,760
see if i can do that over here nope

1572
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,359
always comes up in the same place

1573
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:46,880
so anyway i'm just going to click on

1574
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,880
that i'm going to grab that i'm going to

1575
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,760
put that down here

1576
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,319
okay let me zoom in a little bit

1577
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,440
okay so now what i'm going to do is

1578
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,720
instead of the output of the

1579
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,599
voltage controlled oscillator going into

1580
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:08,640
our patch here

1581
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,000
i'm going to disconnect that i'm going

1582
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,680
to add the noise

1583
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,200
it's just some white noise and there's

1584
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,760
various flavors of noise white pink red

1585
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,880
green and so you can hear what the

1586
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,880
filter is now doing to the noise

1587
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,799
that's kind of kind of got a good good

1588
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,000
sounds like wind through

1589
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,520
trees or something like that in fact if

1590
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,720
i take down

1591
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,000
the envelope generator i think 12

1592
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,799
o'clock

1593
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,799
means that's not doing anything you can

1594
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:39,839
hear what the

1595
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:43,839
filter does to the noise

1596
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,040
just by changing the filter cutoff

1597
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,040
frequency so if you need

1598
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,880
spooky wind sounds for your science

1599
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,160
fiction for your horror movie or

1600
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,839
something this is a good way to get them

1601
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,839
or if you want to do a surf generator

1602
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:05,040
for those relaxing surf tones

1603
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,640
you can do it using the noise now the

1604
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,319
different colors of the noise

1605
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,359
are basically refer to the spectral

1606
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:14,400
uh content pink noise has a little less

1607
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,920
high frequency in a now

1608
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,280
in analogy with light

1609
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,880
pink light has um less blue and more red

1610
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,000
more lower frequency spectrum and so

1611
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,400
so does the pink noise here let me turn

1612
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,079
the filter all the way up so

1613
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,240
so uh you can hear that that's white

1614
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,440
pink red it just gets

1615
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,839
more filtered violet is on high

1616
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,760
frequency and low frequency but not much

1617
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,960
middle uh blue is high frequency

1618
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,680
very hissy um gray and black are

1619
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,160
different

1620
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,240
um are different uh

1621
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,880
probability distributions i think black

1622
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,520
is a uniform distribution and white is a

1623
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,319
gaussian

1624
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:01,440
i forget what gray is

1625
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,119
okay so um white is pretty good for

1626
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,599
most audio things you can also use the

1627
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:10,160
noise

1628
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,440
as control voltages um to if you want

1629
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,079
ever want

1630
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,119
random inputs or make things a little

1631
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,240
bit more human

1632
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,720
or unpredictable you can use the noise

1633
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,720
all right but one of the things um i'm

1634
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,640
going to do now here is going to use the

1635
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,839
noise

1636
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:33,680
for a kind of a um a um

1637
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,119
a classic uh uh snare sound

1638
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,200
and um let me see if i can do this

1639
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,400
manually if i

1640
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:48,000
hit the trigger and i sweep the filter

1641
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,359
you can kind of that's kind of a classic

1642
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:52,079
um

1643
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,839
uh analog um

1644
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,240
snare sound like the tr-808 or something

1645
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,200
like that or

1646
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,119
cross-veric a lot of their snare sounds

1647
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,240
is basically just white

1648
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,119
noise that's gone through a filter suite

1649
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:05,760
so

1650
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,960
um all i need to do to do that is to get

1651
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,760
the um

1652
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,400
adsr to use the envelope generator to

1653
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,920
generate a nice little sweep

1654
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,640
just to go swoop right down and we don't

1655
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,000
need any um

1656
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,240
sustain so we can do this all in the

1657
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,440
attack and the decay

1658
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,319
so um i need to remember to turn up the

1659
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,319
control voltage so the um

1660
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,799
envelope generator is affecting the

1661
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,119
frequency of the

1662
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,920
filter so i'm going to turn that up i'm

1663
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,680
going to turn down the filter so we

1664
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,799
actually get a good

1665
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:42,880
sweep and then now um

1666
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,760
turn down the attack and turn down the

1667
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,079
decay here

1668
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,559
there we go

1669
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,830
[Music]

1670
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,400
so that's a little bit high let's turn

1671
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,400
up the frequency

1672
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,000
and maybe the resonance too so it's a

1673
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,520
little bit more obvious what's going on

1674
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,039
i'm going to turn down the sustain so

1675
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:09,520
there we go

1676
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,960
so that's actually not a bad electro

1677
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:13,440
snare

1678
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,839
sound all right

1679
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,240
okay um let's go over the gates and the

1680
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,680
triggers now

1681
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,599
we don't necessarily have to trigger

1682
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,280
this by the keyboard

1683
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,079
we can add a sequencer module so let's

1684
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,280
do that right now

1685
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,520
and we will trigger our snare from a

1686
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,319
sequencer

1687
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:36,640
so i'm going to right click and it's

1688
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,200
this seek three it's this big module on

1689
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,319
the second row

1690
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,599
with all the knobs and outputs

1691
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,839
okay what this is is this is a state

1692
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:47,119
machine it's just

1693
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,319
walking there are eight states

1694
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,280
or steps as they're called you can

1695
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,000
change the number

1696
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,079
of steps using this knob here let me

1697
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:57,520
zoom into that so

1698
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,319
people can see that um you can change

1699
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:01,760
the number of steps

1700
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,119
using this knob here um the gate

1701
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,760
is um it's generate this is an output is

1702
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,520
generating a um

1703
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,720
an output um gate

1704
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,680
and um these are trigger outputs when

1705
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,280
it's in a particular state

1706
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,359
it will generate a trigger and it's a

1707
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:23,680
little hard to see but you can see um

1708
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,440
it's a little brighter green when it's

1709
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,039
in this particular state

1710
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,280
so it's just walking left to right if

1711
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,039
you've ever used a um

1712
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,440
ever built a larson scanner from evil

1713
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,520
mad scientist or a

1714
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,400
led sequencer is exactly the same thing

1715
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,039
um

1716
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,720
it's just stepping one two three four

1717
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,240
and then going

1718
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,240
right back and that's run off this

1719
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,319
internal clock you can use an external

1720
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:46,880
clock

1721
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,280
but right now it's doing the internal

1722
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,000
clock

1723
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,640
and this button it's a button you can

1724
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,079
start it and stop it using the button

1725
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:59,359
so let's use this gate output to trigger

1726
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:02,880
our snare so that snare is coming

1727
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,599
from right now the trigger is coming

1728
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:06,720
from the keyboard

1729
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,319
so let us um unplug

1730
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:14,079
the um the trigger from our keyboard

1731
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,240
and plug it into the gate now this is

1732
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,920
just going to go bang bang bang bang

1733
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,440
bang so i'm going to mute it quickly

1734
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,400
using the

1735
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,359
mixer but

1736
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,599
let's see do i need to do a gate 2 yes i

1737
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:33,839
need

1738
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:37,599
all right why isn't why aren't we

1739
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,079
hearing that

1740
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,520
let's just do the gate there we go

1741
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,039
all right i'm gonna i'm gonna mute that

1742
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:56,240
using the

1743
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,720
mixer just so it's not on all the time

1744
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,359
and it's not

1745
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,760
super annoying i can also start it and

1746
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,640
stop it

1747
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,680
using the um sequencer so

1748
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,640
turning it back up

1749
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,640
stop and run stop um

1750
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,680
something like that okay well that's

1751
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,119
kind of annoying because that's giving

1752
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,839
us a

1753
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:20,720
um snare hit on every beat what if we

1754
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,280
want it on every other beat

1755
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,880
well that's where we can use these

1756
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,200
trigger outputs down here

1757
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,160
and to do that i'm going to use another

1758
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:30,640
thing

1759
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,839
which will let us combine

1760
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:36,000
multiple triggers these are all outputs

1761
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,839
we can't all hook them up to the same

1762
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:38,720
gate

1763
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,000
we need to mix them first or add them so

1764
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,839
i'm going to

1765
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:47,359
add another module which is where did it

1766
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,598
go

1767
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:57,839
i can just scroll down

1768
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:11,839
oops

1769
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,160
where is the module i'm looking for here

1770
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,520
it is it's called unity

1771
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,198
it's on the far left of the top row

1772
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:22,560
okay and um what this is this is just a

1773
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,960
dumb little mixer it has a bunch of

1774
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,040
inputs and it combines them all into the

1775
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,960
same output

1776
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,120
and you can average them all or you can

1777
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,238
sum them all

1778
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,960
and for audio you might want to use

1779
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,238
average

1780
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,759
for in this case we're using it for

1781
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,600
trigger signals so

1782
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,359
it doesn't really matter but some works

1783
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,279
just great so what i'm going to do is

1784
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:44,158
i'm going to take the

1785
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:47,920
output of this and plug it into the gate

1786
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,198
let me go back up here

1787
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:50,640
once again this is the gate that

1788
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,040
triggers the adsr

1789
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,040
which is triggering our filter which is

1790
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,158
sweeping our noise

1791
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:02,158
and now i can use

1792
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:05,120
individual outputs of the sequencer

1793
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,880
steps to trigger

1794
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,000
the um the um

1795
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,520
the snare so um here i can do it on

1796
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,960
let's do it

1797
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,880
on beats two and four

1798
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,640
and um i'm gonna change the number of

1799
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,479
steps here to four steps

1800
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:25,600
so um i think that's four

1801
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,520
let me count one one two

1802
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:35,839
three four well we can try and see

1803
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,839
okay so you can see only doing it on two

1804
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,198
and four there's nothing on one and

1805
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:41,839
three

1806
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:44,319
so it sounds like it's on one and three

1807
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,560
but it's on two and four

1808
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,600
okay so we can do it on one and four

1809
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:56,400
and so forth and so on so this is how we

1810
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,120
can get

1811
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,440
slightly more um complicated um

1812
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,120
uh sequencers and there's another thing

1813
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,000
you can do

1814
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,080
um before oops give me a second here

1815
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,239
before we're done with the sequencer all

1816
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,199
these knobs

1817
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:17,839
these generate a control voltage output

1818
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,880
so um this row one here this is um on

1819
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,719
every step you can output a different

1820
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,440
voltage

1821
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,239
and if you want to make a nice um

1822
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,080
sequence run like you remember those

1823
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,800
tangerine dream albums um where you have

1824
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,480
a little bit of um

1825
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,440
this motoric repeating um notes uh you

1826
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:35,760
can

1827
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,320
program each one of these knobs to give

1828
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,480
you a different control voltage output

1829
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:44,719
um in fact let let me try this right now

1830
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,520
and um i'm going to take this row one

1831
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,159
output

1832
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:51,220
and i'm going to hook it into the um

1833
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:54,399
[Music]

1834
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,199
let me see uh the resonance

1835
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:03,040
of the um the uh filter

1836
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,800
i hope this works um

1837
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,600
this may be this may be a little intense

1838
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,480
and now

1839
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,960
using these two knobs corresponding to

1840
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,560
these two things we can change the

1841
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,719
resonance

1842
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,800
depending on the beat hopefully this

1843
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,120
works

1844
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:25,360
okay we're on row one here so

1845
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,199
yes there we go

1846
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,519
so that second beat

1847
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,360
has a higher resonance and you can hear

1848
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,600
the filter sweep you can hear that

1849
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,719
hear that resonance actually going down

1850
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,239
okay well that's a good way to get a um

1851
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,640
that filter sweep is a good way to get a

1852
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,440
um

1853
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,120
a syndrome sound um or an 808 kick

1854
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,679
if you take it down so let's do a let's

1855
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:58,880
do a syndrome

1856
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,640
using that exact um principle of

1857
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,760
using a filter at resonance

1858
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,120
to um to uh generate a sound so we're

1859
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,239
going to need a

1860
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,239
another envelope generator and we're

1861
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:13,760
going to need another filter

1862
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,440
but those are easy to add so i'm going

1863
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,440
to do those right over here

1864
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,840
okay let's add a filter

1865
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,880
where is the filter

1866
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,040
here we go vcf filter third one

1867
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,920
in on the top row and we're going to add

1868
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,719
another

1869
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:42,719
envelope generator right click

1870
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,480
adsr all right

1871
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,840
so here i'm going to put the ads on the

1872
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,719
left

1873
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:52,960
and i'm going to hook up the output of

1874
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,840
the adsr

1875
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,480
to the um

1876
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,840
to the frequency of the filter so this

1877
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,440
is going to control the frequency

1878
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,199
we don't need to worry about the input

1879
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,320
because we're going to turn up the

1880
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,440
resonance high enough

1881
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:15,440
that the filter itself is oscillating

1882
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,360
okay um i'm just gonna hook up

1883
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,200
the trigger um

1884
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,199
[Music]

1885
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,880
the gate and the trigger to the keyboard

1886
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,480
just so i can test this now

1887
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:33,840
so let me zoom out a bit

1888
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,520
gate to the gate and the re-trigger

1889
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,400
to the re-trigger

1890
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,400
and now i need to hook up the low-pass

1891
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,560
filter to the filter to the um

1892
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,080
to the mixer here so we can actually

1893
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,239
hear it

1894
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:53,440
low pass filter up to input two on the

1895
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,839
mixer

1896
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,800
okay and here you can actually hear it

1897
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,159
now

1898
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,600
so i'm going to turn down the frequency

1899
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,440
so that's a little bit lower

1900
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,879
because it's now resonating

1901
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,199
okay

1902
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,840
so now if i hit a key

1903
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,360
let me turn up the cv2 here

1904
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,920
there we go

1905
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,120
and i'm going to turn down the sustain

1906
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,679
because we don't need any

1907
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:33,040
and turn down the release

1908
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,800
let's turn down the frequency so that's

1909
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,120
now infrasonic

1910
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,880
and there we have a little bit of a

1911
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,840
syndrome

1912
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,880
okay

1913
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,199
now um if you turn this down a little

1914
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:54,159
bit more you get a lovely lovely um 808

1915
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:55,199
kick sound

1916
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,760
and um on my little laptop speakers you

1917
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,520
can't hear this but if you're wearing um

1918
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,960
headphones

1919
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,560
it's a really lovely resonant um

1920
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,159
big tom tom kick sound

1921
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,480
so if you take that thing all the way

1922
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,799
down

1923
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,679
and you can make it last a little longer

1924
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:18,880
by turning down the decay

1925
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,120
or even longer

1926
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,320
and then going back okay i'm going to

1927
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,000
keep that in the audio frequency just so

1928
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,800
people who aren't

1929
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,600
using headphones can actually hear it if

1930
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,280
you're using a

1931
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:39,679
laptop speaker that may be a little

1932
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:41,280
a little hard to hear if the frequency

1933
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,040
is too low but

1934
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,520
plug this into a nice um amplifier

1935
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,239
system

1936
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:48,960
and you can rattle the roof trust me on

1937
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:49,600
this

1938
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,760
and this is good fun with an analog

1939
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,320
synthesizer and a high power amplifier

1940
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,120
and some good speakers you can really

1941
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,719
really annoy the neighbors

1942
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,719
good times okay so now we have

1943
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:06,560
um two pretty decent um

1944
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,920
uh drum sounds we have our uh snare

1945
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,320
sound

1946
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:17,760
and we have our um uh syndrome

1947
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,480
let's um let's secret some of them both

1948
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,920
now so now i'm going to

1949
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,760
disconnect the keyboard that i was using

1950
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,960
to test

1951
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,159
our syndrome and now we can hook up the

1952
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,360
gate

1953
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,120
to um to the output and now this will

1954
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,239
trigger this on

1955
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:38,080
beat 1 and the snare drums on beat 2 and

1956
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,559
b4

1957
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:45,520
so there we go we got a little drum

1958
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,480
machine i'm now going to um

1959
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,520
use our little mixer here to um

1960
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,280
get more beats um from the syndrome

1961
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,320
so let me

1962
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,520
zoom in a bit okay so i'm going to take

1963
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,880
that gate out

1964
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,120
now and i'm going to hook the gate from

1965
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,000
this output

1966
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,239
and now anything any trigger that go

1967
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:09,600
into this

1968
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,880
little mixer here um now will trigger

1969
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,400
our syndrome over here

1970
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,040
so let's just do that on one and four

1971
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,719
i'm sorry one and three so you can see

1972
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,120
what i'm doing here

1973
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,920
and now if i start this we should get

1974
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,280
boom chick boom chick boom check

1975
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,360
good stuff and we can change the

1976
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,839
frequency

1977
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,080
good stuff if you want um

1978
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,320
a little bit more syncopation let's go

1979
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,480
down to all eight beats

1980
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:48,880
and now we can let's do um

1981
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,520
so if this is a bar with four beats and

1982
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,440
this is a second bar with four beats

1983
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,480
on the second bar let's do um syndrome

1984
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:00,560
on first and uh

1985
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:06,000
second beats and the snare on the third

1986
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:12,800
okay and here we go

1987
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,120
good times and now we can mix the

1988
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,400
various

1989
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,000
drum sounds using our mixer

1990
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:24,080
that's the snare and this is the

1991
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,840
syndrome

1992
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,120
okay and the last thing i'm going to

1993
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,120
show you here is using our

1994
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,960
control voltages here um

1995
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,800
to affect the um the resonance of the

1996
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,000
vcf

1997
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,679
here um to make this a little louder or

1998
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:46,880
softer

1999
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,320
okay so row two over here the resonance

2000
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,719
and now this is the second row here so

2001
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:56,000
if you want um

2002
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,120
patch here is getting a little

2003
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,360
complicated but we can zoom in

2004
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,920
here and uh anything going to this

2005
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:02,960
channel 2

2006
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,000
is our syndrome that's on 2

2007
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,840
and um

2008
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,600
some one and three here rather so we can

2009
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,400
turn these up

2010
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,640
and get a little bit more resonance and

2011
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:23,840
see what that sounds like

2012
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,440
all right yeah actually to be honest

2013
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,800
that actually doesn't change the sound

2014
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,239
very much because the resonance is so

2015
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,400
high that it's oscillating now

2016
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,080
if i wanted to i could mix that in with

2017
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,239
the frequency using another mixer

2018
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:43,920
but i think right now um

2019
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,400
that's about most of the things i wanted

2020
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,840
to show you

2021
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,520
hopefully this gives you an idea that

2022
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,679
this thing exists it's in the world

2023
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:54,800
um how to add in uh how to patch things

2024
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,520
how to add

2025
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,719
add and subtract modules um there any

2026
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,239
questions or anything

2027
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:03,040
um i can definitely take them off the

2028
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,840
chat

2029
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,840
okay where did my chat go chat

2030
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:14,400
[Music]

2031
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,239
i don't see any questions in the chat

2032
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:18,080
right now um the one question

2033
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,800
i had before was uh could you recreate

2034
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,760
the uh

2035
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,199
the the gated reverb uh

2036
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,840
classic sound of the 80s like from in

2037
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,440
the air tonight and things like that is

2038
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,120
there a way to do

2039
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:34,400
a uh something like that bearing in mind

2040
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,760
that i have no idea how it was

2041
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:36,719
originally done

2042
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,800
for phil collins drums or anything like

2043
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,080
that but i just thought

2044
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,320
you know when when i saw the the term

2045
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,159
gates in the sequencer it made me think

2046
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,239
of gated reverb

2047
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:48,159
absolutely that's a great question

2048
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:49,920
that's a great question

2049
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,639
and that would be easy to do except

2050
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,560
right now i'm only using the stock

2051
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,560
modules

2052
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,560
what you need is a reverb and right now

2053
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,800
there is not if you scroll down here

2054
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,280
there is not a reverb in the stock

2055
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,199
modules there are probably lots of

2056
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:08,880
reverbs if you sign in to um the vcv

2057
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:09,600
rack site

2058
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,760
you can get all kinds of modules some of

2059
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,360
them you have to pay for

2060
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,639
um you use definitely use a reverb

2061
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:18,960
and then what you do is after the reverb

2062
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,159
you put that into

2063
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:23,679
a um a um

2064
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,600
voltage controlled amplifier with an

2065
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:26,800
envelope generator

2066
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,800
so you give it a long tail reverb and

2067
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,560
then you just cut it off

2068
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,760
when you want to in fact um uh we got a

2069
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:34,960
little bit of time left so i can

2070
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:35,679
actually

2071
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:39,520
try and um uh simulate that using

2072
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:44,400
um using our delay um

2073
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:47,440
okay so uh let me let me see if i can do

2074
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,239
that

2075
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:52,000
um what's the easiest way to do this

2076
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,840
let me think um

2077
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,719
boy thinking on my feet um okay yeah

2078
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:03,120
let's

2079
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,360
let's just uh do the things we used to

2080
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,159
do

2081
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:11,839
so um

2082
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,960
there we go and that was a good tip in

2083
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,199
the chat if you hit control you can drag

2084
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,360
hold groups of modules around

2085
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:24,719
um so um

2086
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:27,520
let's uh let's just hook this up and um

2087
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,679
i'm winging it here so um

2088
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:33,199
um uh thanks for sticking out

2089
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:34,719
but let's let's try and do a gated

2090
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:36,560
reverb because that's a great uh

2091
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,320
that's a great thing to demonstrate how

2092
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,000
to do okay so what we're going to need

2093
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,040
we're going to need a gate

2094
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:53,840
and we're going to need a um

2095
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,960
let me think okay i think i got an idea

2096
01:22:58,960 --> 01:22:59,840
how to do this

2097
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,040
um let's just

2098
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,960
use the um

2099
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:13,280
use the um vca in the mixer as the gate

2100
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,760
and um that will be

2101
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,600
run by an adsr

2102
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,320
and then we will just stick in a delay

2103
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,960
between the um

2104
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,600
between the snare and the um

2105
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:34,800
and the mixer and that will give us our

2106
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:35,360
reverb

2107
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,679
okay so let's let's do that right now

2108
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,639
let's put in a delay

2109
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,000
where they hide to the delay

2110
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,000
i should know where these things are by

2111
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,760
now but i know there we go

2112
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:54,159
delay okay so um

2113
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:57,600
from the output

2114
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,679
of the filter here which is now going

2115
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:01,520
into the um

2116
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,280
to the mixer let's just put that into

2117
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,600
the delay and patch the delay

2118
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,120
into the output so now

2119
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,600
you can hear there's a little bit of

2120
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,000
delay on the um

2121
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,920
snare drum sound let me turn the snare

2122
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,679
drum sound up

2123
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:19,840
and let me turn down that annoying

2124
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,280
syndrome

2125
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:24,960
so now all we get is a snare drum

2126
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,639
with a little bit of delay so what i'm

2127
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:28,480
going to do is um

2128
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:32,400
kind of um simulate a reverb

2129
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,320
so i'm going to turn the feedback up and

2130
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,159
i'm going to turn down the delay time a

2131
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:36,880
lot

2132
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:45,840
okay and let's see what that sounds like

2133
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,520
yeah that's not not as quite as good as

2134
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,480
a reverb

2135
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,040
but um we don't have a reverb here to

2136
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,480
work with so um

2137
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:05,920
delays delay is what we got um

2138
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,159
so the feedback is how much the output

2139
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,239
is fed back into the delay so if you

2140
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:12,480
turn that up you get a longer longer

2141
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,280
tail

2142
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,880
and i have a short delay time to

2143
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,080
simulate a reverb so

2144
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:21,120
so that's kind of ugly and colored but

2145
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,480
that's what we got

2146
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,880
so now let's um put another envelope

2147
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,560
generator and this is going to control

2148
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,040
our gate

2149
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,519
okay

2150
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,840
adsr

2151
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,639
and uh

2152
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,880
okay so now instead of the adsr

2153
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,120
here controlling the output this one's

2154
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:55,760
going to do it

2155
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,760
right now this is just controlling our

2156
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,480
filter sweep so we're using this adsr

2157
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,799
um

2158
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:09,440
controlling the amplifier the level

2159
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,840
so now we should be able to trigger this

2160
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,199
um

2161
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:16,320
with our adsr and um

2162
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,360
we'll use the decay to um give us our

2163
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,639
gate

2164
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:23,360
so the same thing that's triggering our

2165
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,360
snare drum here

2166
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,840
which i think was this one yeah so i'm

2167
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,159
just going to duplicate this control

2168
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:33,199
and send that to the gate here

2169
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:34,639
so now this is going to be a little bit

2170
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,400
crude because what you want is the gate

2171
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,760
to hang on for a little bit

2172
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,960
then snap off immediately and

2173
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,000
we've only got um i need to

2174
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
stretch that pulse to get the actual

2175
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,920
gate so i'm just going to use the decay

2176
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:48,800
here

2177
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,800
to dry trying to try and do something

2178
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,560
like that

2179
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:56,000
so um take down the attack completely

2180
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,920
and maybe take down the decay and see

2181
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,040
what we can do here

2182
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,719
this is a completely um uh

2183
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:05,360
wing into here so we'll see what we got

2184
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,960
i'm going to take down the clock too so

2185
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:19,840
it's a little slower

2186
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,800
yeah this is not very convincing i

2187
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,960
apologize

2188
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,239
yeah i think what i need to do is

2189
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:41,760
actually get an actual gate that lasts

2190
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,239
how can that last for that lasts for a

2191
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:46,560
different amount of time

2192
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,840
so we can change that independently

2193
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,159
and and here it actually cut off the

2194
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:54,559
reverb

2195
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:57,040
all right

2196
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,960
yep that was not convincing i apologize

2197
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,080
um

2198
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:05,120
uh anyway um i feel like we're kind of

2199
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,360
getting to the end of um

2200
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,080
end of the things i wanted to show um uh

2201
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:10,560
we can

2202
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,560
probably end it pretty soon uh people

2203
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,000
want to hang out and ask questions

2204
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,440
or people want to move on to other

2205
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,360
things

2206
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,400
that is totally cool

2207
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:23,840
and once again i wanna um uh

2208
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,199
i'm just gonna show show my lovely face

2209
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:28,320
again for a moment

2210
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,880
thanks again everybody for joining me um

2211
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,320
this was fun it was great to see

2212
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:32,880
everybody

2213
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,960
i hope hope you got a little bit out of

2214
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,639
this um

2215
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:39,440
lots of listening to me drone on and uh

2216
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,000
throw

2217
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,080
patch cables um it's uh vcv rack is free

2218
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,239
it does a pretty good job of doing the

2219
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,560
things an analog synthesizer would do

2220
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,440
if you feel like um splashing out and

2221
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,120
spending money on actual

2222
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,080
analog synthesizer modules once you

2223
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,159
master stuff on vcv rack i think you're

2224
01:28:58,159 --> 01:28:59,360
a lot better place

2225
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,960
to know what you like and what you don't

2226
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:04,159
like and what you want to use

2227
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:07,760
one of the things i cannot do

2228
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,480
is give you recommendations of um

2229
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,239
synthesizer modules to buy because i

2230
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:13,440
don't actually know

2231
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,159
my personal synthesizer is from the 80s

2232
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:18,159
i don't think they even make it anymore

2233
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:21,840
um i did mention polyphony um vcv rack

2234
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,600
will support a lot of the modules will

2235
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,080
support

2236
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,920
polyphony i actually haven't used it

2237
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,000
that much so you need to explore that a

2238
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,679
little bit yourself

2239
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:31,840
and that probably needs a midi keyboard

2240
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,280
as an input

2241
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:37,440
to actually get a polyphonic note

2242
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,239
note information into the um into the

2243
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:41,920
program because i don't think the

2244
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,679
the computer keyboard will do that

2245
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,800
all right somebody in the chat says they

2246
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,560
have a midi controller plugged in and

2247
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,600
it's working great

2248
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,679
that is awesome a lot of the a lot of

2249
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:56,800
the um

2250
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,159
a lot of the uh uh

2251
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:02,400
modules will support polyphony using

2252
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,080
that one patch cord which is a magic

2253
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,600
thing you can never do in the analog

2254
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,320
world

2255
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,120
um there are definitely reverb uh

2256
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,040
modules for rack i have not looked at

2257
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,000
them in a world

2258
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,040
in a while um the way rack works is um

2259
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,560
to get the full spectrum

2260
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,800
of the modules that are available there

2261
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,159
are hundreds of them

2262
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:22,560
and a lot of them are cool what you need

2263
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,400
to do is make an account

2264
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:27,199
at vcv rack everything's not everything

2265
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:27,840
is free

2266
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,400
some of the some of the modules are paid

2267
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,280
modules

2268
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,040
and you pay money for them you pay money

2269
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,800
to the developer

2270
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,560
and that helps the developer develop

2271
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,560
cool stuff there are a lot of free

2272
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,159
modules there's pretty sure there's a

2273
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:41,440
free reverb there

2274
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,520
um i need to go take a look and see

2275
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,120
what's there i apologize i don't know

2276
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,840
off the top of my head

2277
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,320
um academy can we do this again in a few

2278
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:50,800
months

2279
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:54,080
um i'm certainly game

2280
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,920
yeah maybe i can convince you to do a

2281
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,440
hack chat with us one of these uh

2282
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,560
wednesdays coming up

2283
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,960
oh i'd love to i would love to in fact i

2284
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,320
think um one of the things

2285
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,560
i'd really like to do is um an

2286
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,719
introduction to fourier transforms and

2287
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:07,840
the frequency domain

2288
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,000
using some of the code here and some of

2289
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,840
the principles here because i think

2290
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:15,199
um thinking about the music um

2291
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:16,630
and the audio

2292
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:19,779
[Music]

2293
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,400
how things work in the music and the

2294
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,040
audio domain is a great way to really

2295
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,080
um get a uh intuitive feeling for

2296
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,320
what's going on in the frequency domain

2297
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,199
and um

2298
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:32,639
something that you don't get just by

2299
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:34,719
cranking out fourier transforms or

2300
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:36,560
looking at your spectrum analyzer

2301
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,840
so um one of the things um

2302
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,920
that's on my list is to actually hack a

2303
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,080
little spectrum analyzer into that scope

2304
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,800
module because it is open source and

2305
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,400
that would be a fun thing to do so you

2306
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,360
can see

2307
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:52,320
um that peak that i showed you in the

2308
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,040
filter

2309
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,719
how that would move around as you change

2310
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:56,239
the filter frequency

2311
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:58,480
or being able to pick out the harmonics

2312
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,080
see how the harmonics change

2313
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,480
of the different waveforms yeah that was

2314
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,920
actually one of my first questions when

2315
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,440
i saw the scope i was like well where's

2316
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,120
the spectrum analyzer there's got to be

2317
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:07,840
one right

2318
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:12,560
exactly exactly yeah

2319
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,760
worse than that all right um i think uh

2320
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,639
we can hand it

2321
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:19,440
end it here um uh i want to thank

2322
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,199
everybody for joining me um

2323
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,360
you can if you have questions you want

2324
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,719
to take offline

2325
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:28,159
um i put the slides and the um info

2326
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:31,520
in the hackaday chat um i s i will save

2327
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,639
the um

2328
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:35,120
uh the patches i did in the first and

2329
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,159
the um

2330
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:38,960
and the second parts i will save those
