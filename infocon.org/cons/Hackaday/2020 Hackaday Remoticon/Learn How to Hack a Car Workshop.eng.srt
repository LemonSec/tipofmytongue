00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,720
i just want to welcome

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,679
amit reddy to the uh workshop today

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,519
learn how to hack a car

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,440
um which sounds kind of cool and we got

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,280
a lot of interest in this one so

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,720
there's a lot of people pouring in i'm

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,960
dan maloney i'm a staff writer here

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,359
at hackaday and community engineer at

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,800
hackaday io

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,080
i'll be the moderator for this um amith

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,320
is a recent mechatronics engineering

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,679
student

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,880
a recent graduate to pass the time in

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,640
lockdown he decided to pick up car

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,399
hacking which in another place and time

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,920
might not have been considered a

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,680
terribly good thing to do

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,920
but i'm sure he's been totally legal and

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
totally above board on this

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,800
um as as all good hackers are and he's

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,840
willing to pass this

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,600
information he's learned down to anyone

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,800
who's interested and that's what we're

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,000
gonna do today so

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,879
take it away me i just seen a lot of

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,399
people pour in in the last couple of

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,399
minutes

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,160
we dropped the link in the chat

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
for where to download some files

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,479
i'm going to drop it again just trying

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,840
to find the chat window

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,720
so if you guys can go to that page and

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,799
download

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,080
uh it will say

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,280
like workshop files dot dot g

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,799
g on gz so and uncompress it and we're

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,000
gonna use we're gonna use that

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,240
those files for the workshop today

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,840
i'm just going to i'm going to just keep

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
going through the workshop while you

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,520
download

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,640
while you download those files

44
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,840
okay so what we're going to do for this

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
workshop is

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,840
uh we're just going to discuss why you

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,360
might want to

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,479
hack cars what are some difficulties

49
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,840
in uh in hacking cars some interactive

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
portions we only have like four

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
exercises

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,680
i asked this a little bit uh before the

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,560
workshop

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,000
started if you could uh if any would

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,800
want

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
i would like some volunteers for each

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,200
exercise to help with the pacing

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,879
because i don't want to uh when i get

59
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,879
nervous i talk really fast

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,120
so uh it'll be something like i'll do

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
i'll do a step and you

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,400
you try to follow and

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,640
if something and so that that way i can

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,160
keep uh

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
i can present in

66
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,040
a slow manner and not speed through

67
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,560
everything and like keep

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,959
keep uh you know leave everyone behind

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,160
so if

70
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,640
if that's something you can do uh please

71
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,599
volunteer

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,360
i'll ask for volunteers for before each

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,720
exercises

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,319
so and after the interactive

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,519
portion i'm going to do some demos

76
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,640
with python and savvy can and

77
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
to wrap it all up i'm going to like give

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,000
you guys some additional resources

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,800
that you can read up on and learn more

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,200
skills

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,080
okay dan already introduced me uh but

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,920
i'm about a hundred hours into this

83
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,560
hobby and i still consider myself like

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,360
an expert

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,000
beginner i'm just gonna try to save you

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,519
as much

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,840
um as much time and frustration i i

88
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,799
i experi i experienced in the beginning

89
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,959
so

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,879
hopefully it'll help you out so car

91
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,120
hacking why do it

92
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,440
um to learn like uh automotive systems

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,319
uh it's fun like if you want to extend a

94
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,000
car's functionality

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,760
uh you know there's it also exists uh

96
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,120
some systems in automotive

97
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
automotive systems exist in like other

98
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
systems like heavy machinery

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,080
uh and robotics i worked in a company

100
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,599
that made

101
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,159
um heavy machinery for like the mining

102
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,959
industry

103
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,519
and a lot of their machines ran on can

104
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,560
networks

105
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,478
and like if you ever need to repair your

106
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,600
car

107
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,238
i think it's it's a good skill to have

108
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,918
michigan just recently passed the right

109
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,199
to repair

110
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,120
i believe so like car

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,800
information is going to be more

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,320
available

113
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,040
starting in 2021 or 2022 so that's

114
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,800
something we can look forward to

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
it'll probably charge us a lot of money

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
to get access to it but at least we have

117
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,840
it available

118
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,960
um so

119
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,240
some of the obstacles and uh related to

120
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,840
car hacking is just the sheer amount of

121
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,040
systems and uh within a car and the

122
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,479
complexity of each system

123
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,919
so just list off a few uh

124
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,840
just like the wireless entries like some

125
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
cars have sell your

126
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,320
cellular connection satellite radio gps

127
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,360
radar

128
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,520
um you know tons more speakers

129
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,720
infotainment

130
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,120
systems like auto braking systems lane

131
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
keep systems advanced cruise control

132
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,560
and there's like a ton more that i

133
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,639
didn't even mention

134
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,680
and they all require uh certain hardware

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,479
specialized

136
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,320
hardware to like make sense of like

137
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,000
logic analyzers as

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,960
software defined radios etc etc and

139
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,800
there's differences between

140
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,759
makes and models and even models between

141
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,440
different model years

142
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,639
so so it's kind of hard for

143
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,639
people to communicate that information

144
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,560
so let's say if i'm working on a honda

145
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,360
crv

146
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,479
in 2016 and you're on a different

147
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,880
car it's kind of difficult to share

148
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,360
information that will make it easier

149
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,880
for us uh for us to uh

150
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,080
you know like build off each other's

151
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,639
work and uh obviously auto

152
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,639
automakers want to hide the information

153
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,400
to hinder repair

154
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,319
and stuff so and that's one of the

155
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,080
reasons that i used ic

156
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,120
sim during these introduced beginners so

157
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,639
because we don't have to have all have

158
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,960
all the you don't have to use

159
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,440
the same car or anything like that

160
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,280
so

161
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,240
so before uh i go into icsem

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,840
so the easiest way to get started car

163
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,440
hacking is to get

164
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,720
started uh using the obd2 port

165
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,000
so obd2 deport is like a diagnostic port

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,800
it's found in all cars built in the last

167
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
20 years or so

168
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,720
it's used for diagnostic for purposes

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,520
and emissions testing so the european

170
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,120
versions have the same thing but it's

171
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,240
physically

172
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,639
and technically identical i think to

173
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,680
this port

174
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
so if you're in europe or elsewhere i

175
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
think you'll have something similar

176
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,840
if not the exact same thing

177
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,400
so uh

178
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,520
the regulations only define certain pins

179
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,960
to be certain of things but everything

180
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,520
else

181
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,880
it's up to the automaker's discretion

182
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,280
so the green poor pins are what we're

183
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,479
going to focus on

184
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,360
today uh that those are that's the can

185
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,720
bus

186
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,440
but i'll go through some of the other

187
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,639
pins just for

188
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,199
quick reference so the blue pins are a

189
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,160
pwm signal

190
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,680
and the fourth pin is just chassis

191
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,319
ground and fifth pin is signal ground

192
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,319
so six and seven are can high and low

193
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,160
and 715 are k-line

194
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,400
and l-line um and those are very very

195
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,199
low

196
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,479
uh low bandwidth systems

197
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,120
and and that how that network works is

198
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,879
that there's one master

199
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,319
and many uh slaves or whatever

200
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,240
or followers however you want to define

201
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,120
them um

202
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,120
so that's one reason that can

203
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,879
is better because there are a lot more

204
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,319
nodes on it

205
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,400
uh and there's a lot it's a lot also

206
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,639
much much higher bandwidth

207
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,680
um i'm going to omit the hardware

208
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,960
implementation on lower

209
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,759
low level details on cam frames for this

210
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,960
workshop

211
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,080
um and i'm just going to like

212
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,159
give a high level overview of how how

213
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,120
can works

214
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,880
so let's say we have all these uh

215
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,599
different all the blue squares are

216
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,000
nodes and like if you want to connect

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,679
them in a traditional

218
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,720
spi bus or uart we need to why

219
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,600
we need to share a lot of wires but with

220
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,120
can you just have to have

221
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,160
two wires between the whole lot of them

222
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,920
and one uh complexity that

223
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
comes up with the issue with this issue

224
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,959
is that

225
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,959
if multiple people want to talk at once

226
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,720
or multiple nodes

227
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,839
wants to talk at once

228
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,800
how how does who who gets to go first

229
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,959
and how's that how does that get decided

230
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,240
so there's something called like the

231
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,959
arbitration process for can networks

232
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,839
and basically uh oh i just got cut off

233
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,279
here

234
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,760
basically uh all the notes have an

235
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,200
arbitration id

236
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,920
and the note with the lowest arbitration

237
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,880
id

238
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,279
gets to go first so everyone else who's

239
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,040
a higher number than them

240
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,320
backs off and lets them communicate then

241
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,120
they enter into arbitration again then

242
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
go into it

243
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,760
and then and just repeat it until

244
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,279
everyone

245
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,080
has its chance to speak or broadcast

246
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,000
into the network

247
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
so can like has the highest bandwidth

248
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,720
out of all the car car networks

249
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,160
um except ethernet car return automotive

250
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,959
ethernet

251
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,720
more system more cars are shipping with

252
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,640
ethernet nowadays

253
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,480
it's very easy to add nodes and extend

254
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,399
the the client network and it's very

255
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,839
simple to implement physically

256
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,480
can is actually limits of can is like

257
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,399
it's very low bandwidth compared to like

258
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,720
ethernet or some other protocols um

259
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,680
i think most cars have something like

260
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,600
500 kilobits per second

261
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,079
to 1 megabits per second so very very

262
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,360
limited bandwidth

263
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,560
and each mesh can message can only be

264
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,839
eight bytes long so this is this can be

265
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
poor or limiting for

266
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,040
hard real time systems if you need that

267
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,480
um and you just like if you have a up

268
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,160
if you have a message that's more than

269
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,079
eight bits you have to break it apart

270
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,600
over multiple can messages so that's

271
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:01,839
adds complexity to to your system

272
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,800
um so some parts of a

273
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,360
so how does a can packet look like um so

274
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,320
all can packets have an arbitration id

275
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,880
uh

276
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,120
and uh data like a payload i guess of up

277
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,079
to eight bytes

278
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,720
so some can have up to one or two bytes

279
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,839
all the way up to eight

280
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,040
uh bytes so for example here

281
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,320
this uh 0x

282
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,480
300 so hex decimals we're going to use

283
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
hex decimals

284
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
for the entirety of our presentation

285
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,360
today so

286
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,560
so that's the uh the id and all the

287
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,640
eight bytes i think i have here is the

288
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,959
data

289
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,959
so okay uh we're going to try setting

290
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,079
this up um

291
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,839
do an exercise for the setup then i'm

292
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,120
going to go through the controls for the

293
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,519
ic

294
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,800
sim and and how to get that

295
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,959
set up and what controls do what

296
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,160
uh and if you downloaded uh if you

297
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,240
downloaded the workshop files

298
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,320
in that workshop files i have a workshop

299
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,839
pdf which is just

300
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,800
a pdf of all the slides i have so if you

301
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,839
ever need to

302
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,320
know what commands i'm running you can

303
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,440
just copy and paste

304
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,000
into it into your terminal if you

305
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:38,160
if you miss what what i entered um

306
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,560
okay uh so i'm gonna just get started is

307
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,760
everyone

308
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,040
following along so far okay and uh

309
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
there's a message from leonard

310
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,959
well i guess you guys are having a

311
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,399
different conversation

312
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,240
oh no no so there can be multiple cans

313
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,120
um they can i think automotive

314
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,680
because if you remember if you remember

315
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,760
the the obd port i showed

316
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,560
the undefined uh the ones that are

317
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
undefined it's up to the manufacturer's

318
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,760
uh discretion um so they can add

319
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,399
multiple

320
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,880
can networks or add their own

321
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,560
proprietary network

322
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,440
so uh so like there's a slow can which

323
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,720
is like gm

324
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
cannon or gm lan i forget what the word

325
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,760
is

326
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,200
so that's a lot lot slower

327
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,720
um no idea honestly okay

328
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,800
so let's try uh

329
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,199
let's try setting it up i know some

330
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,279
people had a difficulties

331
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,040
uh installing ic can and everything so

332
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,360
i'm sorry but i i mean i've been told by

333
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,399
dan

334
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,160
that they're going to record this and

335
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,440
post it later

336
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,560
onwards most likely but so if you go

337
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,279
so you still have chance to go to this

338
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,000
workshop

339
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,079
and get the benefit but even if you

340
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,360
don't get that i think you still get

341
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,160
some benefit

342
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,399
from just watching me uh do the

343
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,079
interactive exercises

344
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,440
and also um and it's only only half the

345
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,959
workshop is interactive so

346
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:17,760
the other half is just me doing demos um

347
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,279
okay uh so is is there any volunteers

348
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,199
is there any volunteers uh is i'm gonna

349
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,480
run through the this uh

350
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,839
setup right now

351
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,680
so i set up everything but

352
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,120
it's on a separate notebook so i'll have

353
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,519
to

354
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,560
type comments if you think that that's

355
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,000
slow enough i could

356
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,040
i couldn't be that one okay uh so uh is

357
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,959
your name select

358
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,120
that is that how to pronounce it sonic

359
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,160

360
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
run uh can you everyone's everyone see

361
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,600
the terminal

362
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,000
right now

363
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,720
we've got one person saying that they

364
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,880
can't see the screen

365
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,519
that your screen is is black but i i can

366
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,199
see it fine

367
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,160
and i think also um i mean you've got

368
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,959
something

369
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,680
obscuring um part of your screen right

370
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,040
you're trying to hide some information

371
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,320
there you say you don't dock yourself

372
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,760
that kind of thing uh

373
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,240
like uh uh right now only thing you

374
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,959
should be

375
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,360
you should be able to see the exercise

376
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,079
this thing

377
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,160
i don't know if you can see my mouse and

378
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,199
then see your mouse

379
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,040
but there's there's like a cross hatched

380
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,399
area over on the

381
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,279
left-hand side of your screen that uh

382
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,560
looks like some sort of

383
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,079
um i'm sorry on the right-hand side of

384
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,320
your screen um

416
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,679
okay so so the mod probe

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,360
uh i don't have a script uh shell script

421
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
no no it's just four commands so

422
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,559
we can get to it pretty quick

423
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,799
but like if you if you can't see my

424
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,440
screen i have i'd sent i have a pdf

425
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,679
that i sent it uh with the workshop

426
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,120
files so you can

427
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,000

428
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,120
my slides

429
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,840
so you guys can copy and paste or look

430
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,559
at it closely

431
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,240
on your own screen if you can't see my

432
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,400
screen so

433
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,679
so have you run the first command

434
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,559
already or you're already set up

435
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,880
you already have everything running uh i

436
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,840
am already set up

437
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,039
setup but i i will uh

438
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,480
i will get another uh

439
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,570
another terminal ready so

440
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,840
[Music]

441
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,679

442
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,080

443
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,039
okay you can um is there is there anyone

444
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,080

445
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,360
uh doesn't have it us

446
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,000
running already i don't want i think

447
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,559
iran

448
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,919
uh said uh they that he or she would

449
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,120
volunteer

450
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,200
okay so maybe we can do that instead

451
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,440
hi um hello what would you like me to do

452
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,240
uh i'm just going to run some comments

453
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,799
can you hear me

454
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,240
okay yes yeah so i'm just going to run

455
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,400
some commands if you can follow along

456
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,600
i just want you to pace me because i

457
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,919
don't want to run through it really

458
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,400
quickly and leave people behind so

459
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,919
so have you run the first command

460
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,360
already sudo mod pro can

461
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,320
okay um

462
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,600
then the second character mod pro vcan

463
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,559
and you press enter

464
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,039
so the next command sudo

465
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,320
iplink add

466
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,000
dev dev vcan 0

467
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,440
type vcan

468
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,440
i already have it running in the back so

469
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,720
that's why i got that error but you

470
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,440
shouldn't get that

471
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,080
i think i'm missing some setups

472
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,080
uh do you have an error what what kind

473
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,799
of air do you have

474
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,039
not that i don't have the any of the

475
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,640
libraries and other stuff

476
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,240
installed um

477
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,159
i was just actually joining this

478
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,840
workshop for fun but i am a volunteer

479
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,280
for rumidicon oh so you don't have it in

480
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,799
oh you didn't have it installed okay

481
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,960
yeah

482
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,280
okay okay uh i guess i don't have a

483
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,400
chance to

484
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,679
okay that's fine i'll just have i'll

485
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,360
just run through this commands for

486
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,799
everyone else

487
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,960
but i guess because everyone's on a

488
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,000
different

489
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,840
uh place at the workshop so

490
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,600
yeah oh sorry i did it again

491
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,799
okay thank you sorry

492
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,720
i i was gonna say your your pacing seems

493
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
fine so i don't know we necessarily need

494
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,159
someone to help us pace i think we're

495
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,200
doing okay

496
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,799
okay so okay we'll just pivot to

497
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,640
something yeah i agree

498
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,080
okay so i added the vcan uh link so i'm

499
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,760
going to do the next one

500
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,200
pseudo iplink setup vcan0

501
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,039
so then when i run my ip link

502
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,480
uh then i'm just gonna do on my can so i

503
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,440
have it

504
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,799
up here so

505
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,159
so now i'm gonna try running i see sim

506
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,960
we can zero

507
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,440
uh so that's working so in another

508
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,799
terminal you can slow down

509
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,440

511
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
okay

512
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,400

513
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,679
right now

514

looks like we're getting a lot of

517
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
runnings in the uh in the chat okay so

518
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,960
i'm going to open another

519
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,000
tab then i'm going to run uh my

520
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,960

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,120
where you should have where you made uh

524
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,799
where you built your ic sim

525
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,440
so you can see here i have my controls

526
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,480

executable so so now i'm gonna

528
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,440
run my controls

529
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,360
i need the v can zero again

530
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,760
otherwise it doesn't know what where to

531
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600

00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,600
i don't know about anybody else but i

535
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,880
need to see the terminal

536
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,600
at the same time and i'm already behind

537
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,240
and

538
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,960
i'm already already lost me okay so

539
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,520
where did i lose you

540
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,600

541
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,080
okay thank you i can see it now so i see

542
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,480
sim

543
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,000
we can zero can you tell me if you can

544
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,640
get that running

545
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
no such file or directory so i don't

546
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,240
know what's happened

547
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,760
uh did you you should

548
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
i think you need to compile it yeah i

549
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,440
don't have the executable

550
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,799
so yeah like if you if you built and i'm

551
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,080
just going to close it

552
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,559
if you built your files like if you ran

553
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,000
make on

554
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,159
uh your ic sim directory the one you

555
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,520
don't downloaded

556
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,000
uh then you'll shoot then you'll be able

557
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,559
to run it

558
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,400
have you have you ran make on your icy

559
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
sim stuff

560
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,159
yes i have but there was an error that

561
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,520
said uh something to do with

562
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,799
sdl2 oh okay so uh

563
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,640
you have to go through another process i

564
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,240
i so

565
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,600
uh i'm sorry i can't i can't do that

566
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,400
right now

567
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,640
that's okay i'm sorry about that um

568
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,320
like in the public chat if like

569
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,159
afterwards you can go there's someone

570
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,480
someone who already solved that issue uh

571
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,760
so

572
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,559
okay thank you okay thank you so i'm

573
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,039
gonna go

574
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,320
controls we can zero

575
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,360
again okay so

576
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,840
so no i i know what i hope no one needs

577
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,799
a terminal

578
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:58,240
but so with the controls selected

579
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,240
if i hold down uh the up arrow you

580
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,880
should see the

581
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,640
up arrow moving so

582
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,039
if i hold down the left and the right uh

583
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,320
arrow keys you should see

584
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,440
the left and right uh blinking and the

585
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,679
door unlock is little finicky

586
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,400
so basically how you unlock all doors is

587
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,600
you hold

588
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,400
the right shift then you tap the left

589
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,679
shift

590
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,120
and it takes a second you might have to

591
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,840
do it again

592
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,120
or the other way around maybe

593
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,840
okay there we go

594
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,159
and i just refer to my instructions hold

595
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,440
right shift and tap

596
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,840
left shift okay it's a little it's a

597
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,520
little finicky the display so

598
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,880
it's kind of hard to get it running

599
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,039
sometimes

600
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,360
okay so um

601
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,799
yeah so like if it's that's fine that

602
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,320
means it's unlocked

603
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,919
so if it's completely locked you should

604
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,679
hold down us

605
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,039
okay i guess i mixed up the uh the

606
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,640
instructions so it's the opposite of

607
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,760
what i wrote down

608
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,000
to lock all doors and unlock all doors

609
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,080
uh yeah you need two terminals chris

610
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,360
so i think it's you hold down left

611
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,559
shift

612
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,360
uh and tap right shift to unlock and you

613
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,279
hold down right shift

614
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,039
and you tap left shift to lock

615
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,440
everything

616
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,919
okay so i'm going to move on to the next

617
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,600
exercise

618
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,760
so

619
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,440
so uh there's going to be a lot of

620
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,880
terminals so just pick up if i'm

621
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,240
obscuring anything

622
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,520
so i'm just going to minimize the

623
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,559
terminals i have uh

624
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,799
the can controllers or uh the ic sim

625
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,760
stuff running

626
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,440
so now i'm going to open up open up a

627
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,360
new

628
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,279
terminal then i'm going to run

629
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,200
can dump so this is part of the can

630
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
utils you guys installed

631
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,240
um so i'll just say canned on vcan0 and

632
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,320
we'll see what it's doing so i don't

633
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,080
know if zoom is capturing this

634
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,120
it's pretty uh it may not be fast enough

635
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,960
but uh it connected a canada i've been

636
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,399
just connected to

637
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,520
uh the virtual can interface and uh

638
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,240
and just dumping all the the messages

639
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,120
that it sees

640
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,239
onto your terminal can people see this

641
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,520
yeah okay thank you yeah that's

642
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,480
scrolling nicely

643
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,760
that's good update okay so now one other

644
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,000
feature we can do

645
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,200
of candump is that we can uh run canned

646
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,080
up and dump

647
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,440
all the files um

648
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,520
into oh sorry dump all the uh the

649
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,440
messages into a file

650
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,200
so i'm going to run kandam dash

651
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,120
capital l arrow key i guess i don't know

652
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,600
how you

653
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,159
say that word so i'm going to call mine

654
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,000
first.log

655
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,840
and vcan0

656
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,679
so that's basically recording in the

657
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,799
background

658
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,799
um and so we're going to try to do

659
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,880
something called a replay attack

660
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,159
so um we're gonna try to

661
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,799
we're gonna record uh unlocking our

662
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,799
doors

663
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,600
um and see if we can catch that message

664
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,000
to unlock our doors

665
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,320
so i'm gonna do pull down left shift

666
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,360
and tap right shift

667
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,399
so when my door is unlocked um

668
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:58,080
so then i'm going to stop my candle file

669
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,520
so uh if i do uh

670
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,039
less ls i see that i have a fan

671
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,720
first dot log file there

672
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,320
so um i'm gonna just uh

673
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,200
i'm going to just peek at my candom or

674
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,320
the my log

675
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,159
first.log so head dash n10

676
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:26,010
first.log and you see this

677
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,919
[Music]

678
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,000
these messages are like uh this is

679
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,919
similar so they're just simulating

680
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,159
a lot of different notes so if you see

681
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,039
this

682
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,600
um let's just do something with a little

683
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,520
bit more readable human readable

684
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,520
so i'm going to run my head command

685
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,559
again head

686
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,279
and 10 first dot log and i'm going to

687
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:45,840
dump that

688
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,720
into another can utils command called

689
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,440
log

690
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,360
too long so it's a little bit more human

691
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,399
readable

692
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,200
so each of these nodes each of these ids

693
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,480
represents

694
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,720
uh a different microcontroller

695
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,640
passing messages into the canvas

696
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,919
um okay so let's just look at our

697
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,039
uh a file that we uh like let's look at

698
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,880
how long our file that we just opened

699
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,520
this

700
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,240
so do if you do uh wc work which stands

701
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,200
for word count

702
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,279
but it also counts lines if you pass in

703
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,240
the

704
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,039
dash l command then you do first dot log

705
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,559
so you can see there's 75 000 messages

706
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,399
in that brief 30 seconds we had it

707
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,559
running

708
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,919
so um the way you do a replay attack is

709
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,039
you um replay the

710
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,760
the file that you captured and see if

711
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,399
you can

712
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,918
get uh come on

713
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,880
can you mute everyone again i think i

714
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,320
decided to interrupt you

715
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,200
um okay i guess we removed it again

716
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,919
so um

717
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,120
so the basic how it works is that you

718
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,640
play back

719
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,799
all the files you can all the messages

720
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,919
you capture

721
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,840
back onto the weekend virtual can

722
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
interface

723
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,519
by doing that we

724
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,200
we can basically say that we can trick

725
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,399
the system into saying that we are

726
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,919
running that command

727
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,000
uh or the system itself is running that

728
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,240
command so i'm just going to lock my uh

729
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,760
doors again so i think it's

730
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,880
hold right shift and left shift or the

731
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,440
other way around

732
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,039
oh i have to have to select my uh

733
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,480
the window with the controller on it so

734
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,840
so have it locked oh no i guess not

735
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,120
okay i'm just gonna wait to see if it's

736
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,880
locked okay uh

737
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,120
it's locked so

738
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,360
i'm gonna use another uh

739
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,919
can utils that you guys downloaded is

740
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:04,559
called can

741
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,399
player so i'm going to pass in

742
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,600
when trying to pull the log file i get

743
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,840
an error

744
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,679
can you just ryan you can just try using

745
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:22,880
le uh

746
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,360
uh just do you have to pass in head and

747
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,320
ten because it's

748
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,960
such a big file it could uh it can crash

749
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,399
it can give you errors so if you

750
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,519
pass in uh this command here

751
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,960
head dash n 10 and you have to grab it

752
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,320
so you have to use this vertical

753
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,600
separator

754
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,880
and log too long or you can just do this

755
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,840
oh i think i made a mistake here so here

756
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,279
what i forgot to include was you have to

757
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,960
pass in the name of your

758
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,320
file burst.log

759
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,679
and it'll work so that's my bad okay

760
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,799
so so can

761
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,480
player and uh i think

762
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,200
my instructions on the next slide so

763
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,679
clan

764
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,720
cam player dash i'm going to

765
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,559
show you this dash i

766
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,760
capitalize um

767
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,200
and pass in our

768
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,480
file hopefully it works

769
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,600
and we'll just wait to see if it

770
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,559
i guess it's 30 seconds so it'll take a

771
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,840
while to get through everything

772
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,080
so while this is okay there uh it

773
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,679
managed to unlock

774
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,679
uh the doors just by replaying these

775
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,760
messages so i'm just gonna exit out of

776
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,640
that

777
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,519
so basically uh the whole uh what we're

778
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,960
gonna do

779
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
what we you would normally do is that

780
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,359
you would split

781
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,199
um you would split that can file

782
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,399
or that the candump log into two

783
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,440
files and replay

784
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,079
each of them and to see which uh section

785
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,639
of

786
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,480
the which

787
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,040
so if we split the original file into

788
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,079
two files

789
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,879
so each one has half the can messages

790
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,440
then we

791
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,960
when we replay the first uh

792
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
at the first split the so if the first

793
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,079
half

794
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,879
and we see if that that message unlocks

795
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,960
our doors again

796
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,599
if it does great that means there's that

797
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,480
can message

798
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,040
that we're looking for is in that part

799
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,199
otherwise we know it's in the other half

800
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,079
so and we keep repeating this until we

801
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,280
only have uh one

802
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,440
um can packet left so that's the

803
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,640
uh that's that can uh

804
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,200
that's the can uh id that unlocks the

805
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,839
cars

806
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,520
so because we're not i'm not gonna make

807
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,839
you do this with 75 000

808
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,680
line file that will take you for all

809
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,119
night to get through

810
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,079
especially using command line utilities

811
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,599
if you look at in your workshop files

812
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,440
so this is this is what i get after

813
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,480
unzipping my workshop

814
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,880
so there's a file here called the hunter

815
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,680
lines dot log

816
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,319
you can try replaying

817
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,400
uh there you can try replaying that file

818
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,000
on

819
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,680
on your network so

820
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,680
i'm just going to navigate to my desktop

821
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,960
uh sorry navigate to my workshop files i

822
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,119
mean so i'm going to go to the folder

823
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,760
called ic sim

824
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,359
so i see there's 100 lines

825
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,800
there so i'm going to do can player

826
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,119
again

827
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,640
dash i

828
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,400
okay first before i run that command i'm

829
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,280
going to make sure

830
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:27,119
my car is locked

831
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,480
i have to select the controller again

832
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,440
so hold down rep right shift okay there

833
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,320
so i'm going to run it again

834
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,839
i hope you guys can see what i uh

835
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,119
yeah it's 100 lines with much faster

836
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,880
than 75 000 lines

837
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,119
so

838
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,079
i'm gonna try locking my doors again

839
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,240
okay okay yeah so i

840
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,599
okay so i'm going to do run

841
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,440
so i'm going to run a command line

842
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,040
utility called split

843
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,640
so dash l uh then i'm going to run

844
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,520
the 100 lines log or passing the hundred

845
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,240
line

846
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,760
dot log file name um

847
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,000
so

848
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,640
so i'm gonna just because i'm just gonna

849
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,800
split it into a 50 lines each

850
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,839
and uh and then give a precip

851
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,560
prefix of two and i'll show you what

852
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,000
that does

853
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,960
so we split the initial 100 lines into

854
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,800
two files called 2aa

855
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,599
and 2 a b

856
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,400
um so when i'm going to run it again i'm

857
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,760
going to run the command again

858
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,200
what's the word a can player

859
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,400
dash i and i note that my car is already

860
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,560
locked

861
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,280
then i'm going to run the 2aa file so

862
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,640
that's the first half

863
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,079
of the thing oh and it unlocks so we can

864
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,280
guess that

865
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,040
it's in um it's in the it's in that

866
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,119
part of the file so i'm not gonna i'm

867
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,800
not gonna keep going through it until

868
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,720
there's only like a couple lines left

869
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,480
uh so we can just check our work so if

870
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,839
you guys can read this

871
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:35,359
um i'm going to clear all the things so

872
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,800
uh i'm going to do run less

873
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,240
passing 2a and i'm going to

874
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,400
pipe that into grep 19

875
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,920
then i'm going to run a comma then i'm

876
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,160
going to

877
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,000
try to find it if there's anything that

878
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,760
matches uh

879
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,200
that line so so the id can id that

880
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,359
uh of the of the message that

881
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,280
unlocks doors is uh 19b

882
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,040
um so we can check it our work again

883
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:15,839
oh classes are on terminal

884
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,920
uh whoops where's my oh there we go

885
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,800
i'm gonna minimize this again so we can

886
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,119
do

887
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,640
another command called can send

888
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,520
uh we're just going to copy the line we

889
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,800
found

890
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,640
ctrl or right click

891
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,320
now paste again then i'm going to hit

892
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,720
enter

893
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,079
uh oh oops i messed up something

894
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,880
okay i'm gonna lock the door so you guys

895
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:57,839
can see what i just did

896
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,720
okay i'm gonna lock the doors again i'm

897
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,800
just gonna wait for it

898
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,839
it happens okay so i'm gonna show you if

899
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,839
you run the command

900
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,040
so it's unlocked so we know we found the

901
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,640
right

902
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,279
id number

903
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,440
okay uh thanks man no

904
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,920
i don't know how to say your name na

905
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,280
rizena

906
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,400
i don't know i'm not that good with

907
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,560
linux so thank you

908
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,920
so we confirmed that's that's the id um

909
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,680
so let's do something let's do the same

910
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,520
process of finding ids

911
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,640
with using a little bit more interactive

912
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,800
process so we have something called can

913
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
sniffer

914
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,240
um

915
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
okay i'm just going to make sure i see

916
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,359
everything

917
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,640
i'm just going to lock my doors because

918
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,400
i don't want it to blink

919
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
so i hope you guys can see everything on

920
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,000
my screen

921
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,839
because there's a lot of stuff on my

922
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,960
screen

923
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,720
so we don't actually need these two

924
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,079
things uh

925
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,240
for now or actually i guess we do

926
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,119
so

927
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,920
uh stephen 19b is the arbitration id

928
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,119
um that uh so each

929
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,200
remember each can message has a

930
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,640
arbitration id

931
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,000
which tells you uh the system where

932
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,040
uh which what node of the network is

933
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,480
coming from

934
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,560
um and uh followed by the actual data

935
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,560
packets so

936
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,520
uh so 19b is the actual module i don't

937
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,200
know if the virtual module

938
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,119
that that sends the commands

939
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,880
okay um so i'm just going to do can

940
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,920
sniffer and i'm going to pass in i'm

941
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,760
going to do dash c and you'll learn why

942
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,599
um later so

943
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,240
so so by running the dash c i it'll

944
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,880
highlight

945
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,119
all the uh all the

946
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,640
the bytes that are changed from the

947
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,480
previous command

948
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,720
uh so it's kind of there's so many notes

949
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,680
here i think

950
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,760
i think there's about 40 notes virtual

951
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,240
notes so it's kind of hard to see what

952
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,200
you're doing

953
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,920
uh so like even if you do anything like

954
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,560
i'm just

955
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,960
uh i'm just going to select this like

956
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
i'm pressing my

957
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,280
acceleration button and stuff like that

958
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,640
and you can't really see

959
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,839
make heads or tails of what's going on

960
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,400
so there's something we can do called

961
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,440
notching

962
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,599
so we can save all the bytes that we see

963
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,520
on the screen at this moment

964
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,880
so you can do it by running

965
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,680
if you see on the left side here uh

966
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,800
hashtag

967
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,359
and the enter key so i'll just keep i'll

968
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,720
just run this

969
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,240
a couple times and you can see

970
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,040
uh this red slowly going away

971
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,640
i'm just going to keep running it a bit

972
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,359
more okay this is very easy because like

973
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,200
this is a virtual simulator

974
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,480
and uh it's it's sending the same two or

975
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,319
three patterns over and over again

976
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,359
so it's easier to like uh take all the

977
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,319
all those messages out so now let's try

978
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,800
to see if you can see

979
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,560
i'm just going to cover up my slides

980
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,599
whoops

981
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,160
then i'm going to press the acceleration

982
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,760
key and you can see

983
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,680
there's one byte i guess you can't see

984
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,119
me point with my finger

985
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,720
but you can see that there's one byte

986
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,439
that's changing

987
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,119
so and uh and i'm going to try doing

988
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:53,520
that

989
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
same thing for the acceleration command

990
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,680
or sorry the left blinker

991
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,119
and you can see that there's one uh

992
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,240
byte that's changing on a different

993
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,480
on a different id command

994
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,680
not a command sorry a different can id

995
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,200
um so this is like still

996
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,480
very cumbersome because there's like

997
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,640
still so many um

998
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,839
packages flying past you in actuality

999
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:22,800
you won't

1000
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,440
you rarely use can sniffer like from the

1001
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,480
command line

1002
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,880
uh you would use like a uh like a gui uh

1003
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,880
thing called like uh something like uh

1004
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,640
savvy can uh and that's like much easier

1005
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,880
to see the changes and i'll demo that

1006
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,920
later

1007
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,760
um so well i guess i'll demo it now

1008
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,000
sorry i forgot how my presentation went

1009
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,160
so

1010
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,400
originally i used i had this uh in

1011
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,440
uh in the prerequisites but i think i

1012
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,800
thought it would be a little bit too

1013
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,079
hard for

1014
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,359
to get three different programs

1015
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,680
installed for

1016
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,839
this test

1017
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,960
uh it's it's saving uh chris it's saving

1018
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,640
the bytes when i press

1019
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,160
uh command uh sorry pound key plus enter

1020
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,200
it's saving the bytes to uh

1021
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,119
in memory and you can you can output

1022
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,560
that into a file

1023
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,720
later on so it's not just clearing the

1024
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,960
red it's saving the

1025
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,880
uh it's saving the messages

1026
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,920
because how can sniffer works is that

1027
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,280
it compares it stores the previous uh

1028
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,680
data message and it compared and it once

1029
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,960
it gets a new message

1030
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,359
it compares between the old one and the

1031
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:44,400
new one

1032
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,560
and then it sees okay which bytes it's

1033
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,160
changed and it highlights

1034
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,920
those bytes um

1035
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,839
uh i haven't used a wireshark for this

1036
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,400
uh because i use wireshark for like tcp

1037
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:00,880
stuff

1038
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,319
but it's not really built for can

1039
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,800
messages uh i'm sure i

1040
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,560
i'm pretty sure it has an extension it

1041
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,079
can read can uh

1042
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,079
it can connect to socket can but it's

1043
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,760
not the best there are better programs

1044
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,319
for it

1045
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,480
like savvy can i'll just demonstrate it

1046
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,319
for you right here

1047
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,760
so we're going to use the cavican

1048
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,760
sniffer and

1049
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,720
you can see right away it's like a lot

1050
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,000
better

1051
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,319
here

1052
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,880
so there's a couple of commands i'm not

1053
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,400
going to go through it right now so i'm

1054
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,680
going to do the same thing before

1055
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,119
instead of running a hashtag and enter

1056
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,240
i'm just going to click notch

1057
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,400
so then i'm gonna i can mute notch bytes

1058
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,680
i'm gonna fade in active bytes

1059
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,119
you can go down to the bit level but

1060
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,960
that's a little too much information for

1061
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,319
us right now

1062
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,200
um so then i'm gonna do the same

1063
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,400
acceleration command

1064
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,800
okay there so right now i can see that

1065
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,480
it's 244

1066
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,200
the acceleration command key is tied to

1067
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:03,839
so

1068
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:07,680
it's a lot easier to see it with a can

1069
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,800
like with the with savvy can

1070
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,240
but obviously i can't get everyone to

1071
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,839
install that program

1072
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,440
and i'm going to do the same thing with

1073
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,400
with the signals and you guys can see

1074
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,319
that 188

1075
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:27,040
is the can id for those signals

1076
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,559
so i'm going to just close out of this

1077
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,440
net for now

1078
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,160
what else should okay and the

1079
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,839
if you guys want to do the playback

1080
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,880
uh that savvy can also has that uh

1081
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,640
functionality um but it's still

1082
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,599
cumbersome to

1083
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,440
uh to start with the 75 000 line uh

1084
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,880
file and just slowly trim it down so

1085
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,960
this is not the file i think

1086
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,839
it's not the oh

1087
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,290
okay there we go so this is not the

1088
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:13,420
[Music]

1089
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,480
uh this is not to the sorry i lost my

1090
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,680
train of thought

1091
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,839
i think it's

1092
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,079
yeah capture bisector so this is you can

1093
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,359
do this a little bit easier

1094
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,119
what we're doing before where you're

1095
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,640
splitting the files

1096
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,000
um into smaller files so you can do it

1097
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,920
there's a lot more options here you can

1098
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,599
you can just split ids like based on the

1099
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,480
range

1100
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,440
so the the thought behind this is that

1101
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,319
the lower

1102
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,440
uh numbers are reserved for

1103
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,240
high uh

1104
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,160
for more valuable uh uh sensors and

1105
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,839
stuff that need to be sending all the

1106
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:56,559
time

1107
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,520
uh so for door hat for door unlocks we

1108
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,440
can probably choose like a higher id to

1109
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,240
start with

1110
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,160
so that's one what's that's one other uh

1111
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,040
um that's one other uh strategy you can

1112
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:09,920
use

1113
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,520
uh steven i'm going to cover how to do

1114
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,359
this on a real car in the later half of

1115
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,160
the

1116
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,160
presentation uh and i'm gonna go through

1117
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,280
that just ask me that

1118
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,640
afterwards um um so yeah so this is a

1119
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,559
little easier but it's still cumbersome

1120
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,440
um so i'm gonna show you another way i

1121
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,040
interact with the the

1122
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,559
stuff uh i'm gonna do

1123
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,839
how i can do it with python so the

1124
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:34,480
strategy

1125
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,640
is similar to it's a little bit

1126
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,040
different

1127
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,520
to before i'm not sure if it's possible

1128
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,200
to run on embedded devices uh

1129
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,960
gram matic i'm not sure if that's right

1130
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,599
right way to pronounce it um it's savvy

1131
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,920
cam's pretty uh relatively intensive ram

1132
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,440
for embedded devices so

1133
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,359
so i'm going to do a demo with python

1134
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,559
but so i already

1135
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,160
did this before i'm just going to show

1136
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,079
you the results of it so the strategy is

1137
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,400
pretty simple

1138
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,240
uh you record i see sim

1139
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,000
um when when you're not inputting uh

1140
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,599
any anything like so you're not pressing

1141
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,400
any keys or anything like that

1142
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,599
sorry excuse me so you're not uh

1143
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,160
and putting anything so you have like a

1144
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,000
uh the ic7 in an ideal id

1145
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,800
idle state uh then you record another

1146
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,680
file

1147
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,480
uh with canada doing an action that

1148
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,920
we're interested in

1149
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,040
then we can compare uh the two log files

1150
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,839
to find similarities and differences uh

1151
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,240
so

1152
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,839
and with python you can do a little bit

1153
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,640
easier so this is the code this you have

1154
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,599
i'm not going to go through the code

1155
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,760
right now but you guys have that in your

1156
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,280
workshop files if you

1157
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,720
know python and you want to go through

1158
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,119
it um

1159
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,960
so i'm going to first uh

1160
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,920
open up the icsim baseline.log

1161
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,119
so and it downloads it into uh a table

1162
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,079
um so that's the idle one i see sim in

1163
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,599
an ideal state

1164
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,880
uh then i'm gonna

1165
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,280
see i'm gonna go through each id and

1166
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,480
count how many uh

1167
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,960
times it's it appeared in the log file

1168
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,559
and how many times

1169
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,240
um how many unique packets there are

1170
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,880
so uh you can this kind of pulls back

1171
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,920
the

1172
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,720
what you call uh

1173
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,359
it it pulls back the curtain i guess and

1174
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,800
you guys it's because it's like i see

1175
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,280
sim is

1176
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,440
it's the simulator so you can you can

1177
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,680
see that there's very few unique

1178
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,400
uh data packets um oops

1179
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,720
so uh so i do that again with uh

1180
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,920
with the file where i uh toggle the

1181
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,319
the signals left and right and then i

1182
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:58,960
compare

1183
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,160
the two or sorry i i do the i count go

1184
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,480
through

1185
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,480
everything and count it again um

1186
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,599
then it compares the two so in this case

1187
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,280
because it's uh it's a simulator

1188
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,040
we can see that's 188 is more present

1189
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,720
in one than the other one and uh and 244

1190
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,160
is also uh present in another one so

1191
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,520
those are the two inputs that we enter

1192
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,119
uh inputted so that's pretty easy to see

1193
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,800
uh go through python

1194
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,400
that's one other way of doing it if

1195
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,480
you're if you're comfortable coding

1196
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,839
and one more thing you can do with

1197
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,400
python um

1198
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,200
is that socket can what it actually does

1199
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,559
is that

1200
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,599
it extends like the tcp sockets that you

1201
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,000
uh you would normally use so you can

1202
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,960
connect to

1203
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,000
uh vcan through python uh i haven't done

1204
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,359
that but that's something you should be

1205
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,319
aware of

1206
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,440
um if you if you uh if you if you like

1207
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,000
that approach

1208
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,680
better so obviously like there's like

1209
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,640
much more complicated analysis possible

1210
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,559
we can do change in real time

1211
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,400
uh changing like more complicated

1212
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,839
frequency changes um

1213
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,160
so

1214
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,920
i guess i'm nervous as nervous my mouth

1215
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,760
is drying out

1216
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,440
but uh so in

1217
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,359
in the car messages or sorry in the

1218
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,200
workshop files

1219
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,359
um i sent you guys

1220
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,240
uh i have the the files i was talking

1221
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:38,960
about before

1222
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,599
the ics and baseline the signals if you

1223
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:42,000
want to do

1224
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,920
it again with your own programming

1225
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,200
language that you like

1226
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,599
but i also included the data files

1227
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,520
for for my vehicle it's a 2016

1228
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,240
crv honda with the touring trim audition

1229
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,280
and i recorded uh

1230
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,000
it in different states so i recorded it

1231
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,160
you can record it i'd recorded it in

1232
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,280
driving and i recorded it while i was

1233
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,640
sitting idle in park uh i recorded uh

1234
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,640
it by jamming all the buttons on the

1235
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,079
steering wheel

1236
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,920
then i recorded it turning the steering

1237
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,680
wheel one way and the other way

1238
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,720
and toggling both the signal and the

1239
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,240
wiper stocks

1240
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,479
um

1241
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,319
uh so yeah there's uh so uh and i'm

1242
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,400
gonna just i'm gonna use those for

1243
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,319
uh for running uh the command

1244
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,319
so i'm going to use those files for

1245
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,319
running can player

1246
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,000
and you guys can do this too so you just

1247
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,319
got you can see how much

1248
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,720
more information there is in an actual

1249
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,359
um

1250
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,078
in an actual

1251
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,920
uh vehicle so i'm going to close out of

1252
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,240
uh

1253
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,720
the the icy sim we don't i don't think

1254
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,000
we'll need it anymore

1255
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,359
yeah this is our last exercise

1256
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:11,598
so i'm just gonna force quit

1257
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:20,000
uh

1258
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,920
i think like when the engine light comes

1259
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,240
on well will said uh i'm gonna repeat

1260
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,640
the

1261
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,799
message for people who can't see it do

1262
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:27,839
can uh

1263
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,240
do car store a log for diagnostics or

1264
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,040
anything

1265
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,079
uh i'm not sure i think it

1266
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,400
varies by vehicle but it's typically

1267
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,000
when you see an engine light

1268
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,240
turn on they do store some information

1269
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,680
so you don't have to like always have it

1270
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,280
running so

1271
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,520
but only for like certain cases and it

1272
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,200
i'm sure it varies by a different mix

1273
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,760
so i'm not sure how many people are

1274
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,760
still following along interactively

1275
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,799
but i'm gonna just oh oh sorry

1276
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,839
i'm going to run can sniffer again i'm

1277
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,280
going to use the

1278
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,280
uh the savvy can because it's easier for

1279
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,359
you to you at home

1280
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,400
to read it so i'm going to use savvy

1281
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,799
cans

1282
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:18,160
sniffer i'm going to run

1283
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,760
my can player dot i driving

1284
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,559
dot log you guys can you'll be using

1285
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:25,680
your can sniffer

1286
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,599
instead so i'm going to show you how to

1287
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,119
do that can't sniffer

1288
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,040
vcan0 so then i'm going to run

1289
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,040
the driving log i think the driving log

1290
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,280
is huge it's like 10 minutes of driving

1291
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,359
me going to uh tim horton drive-thru

1292
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:40,559
here in canada

1293
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:45,839
so it's a lot of information so um

1294
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,640
and you guys can uh even while it's

1295
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,400
interacting can't sniff you if you

1296
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,240
if you type in c and enter you'll turn

1297
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,559
on the the color again

1298
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,000
so i'm just gonna

1299
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
let it not i'm just gonna keep notching

1300
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,799
and you speaking

1301
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:13,839
okay so like there's a lot of data here

1302
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,319
so so

1303
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:26,240
uh pure trick uh if

1304
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,000
uh peter trick asks is are there any

1305
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,720
downsides of repeating thousands of can

1306
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,480
commands into an actual car uh

1307
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,400
in you you should never replay dump

1308
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,599
replay stuff into a moving car uh i

1309
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,520
whenever i done it i always done it in

1310
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,480
park and uh

1311
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,400
um i always done in park

1312
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,680
so and i have my wheels blocked off so

1313
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,160
the car can't go anywhere and the newer

1314
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:56,799
vehicles

1315
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:00,480
have uh um the newer vehicles have like

1316
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,240
an electronic transmission

1317
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,119
so you have a danger of like putting

1318
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,960
into gear using a command

1319
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,160
so uh so

1320
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,440
see steven says i don't really

1321
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,440
understand what notching does

1322
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,760
so basically what notch does is that

1323
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,839
you just it saves the data

1324
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:28,400
um to a file or a memory

1325
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,160
so let's let's just look at all of this

1326
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,000
so here it says 50 of

1327
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,040
ff right so if i notch that it'll fade

1328
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:35,280
it

1329
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,559
to so the next time uh there's ff in

1330
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:39,839
that data spot

1331
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:43,200
it won't turn on red

1332
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,760
um we can just

1333
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,839
i'm gonna discuss that with the real

1334
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:50,880
data car

1335
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,720
playing stuff translating this to a real

1336
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,920
car pretty soon so

1337
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,599
so we're almost done this stuff

1338
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,680
so decoding signal a couple of people

1339
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,480
asked me

1340
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,880
beforehand like to spend some time

1341
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,319
decoding signals

1342
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:14,319
um and this is a very labor intensive

1343
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,319
process there's like as far as i know

1344
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,040
there's no um

1345
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:24,160
there's no uh easy way of

1346
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,520
of going through it just like a lot of

1347
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,760
labor

1348
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,079
so i'm just gonna turn off this can

1349
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,839
sniffer for now

1350
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,598
okay shut this off

1351
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,839
so uh if possible find someone else

1352
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,119
somebody else who already did it that's

1353
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,359
what i did and that saved me a huge

1354
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,160
amount of time

1355
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,960
trying to decoding

1356
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,640
files so the way you get this

1357
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,520
information

1358
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,319
is passed around is something called uh

1359
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:05,920
a dbc file

1360
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,119
uh it's also i also included that within

1361
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,200
um your uh files that i had to download

1362
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,640
so you guys can take a look at that

1363
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,480
before

1364
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,760
so i'm going to show you um

1365
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,799
on how how it works so here

1366
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,599
um i guess i'm just going to make sure

1367
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,839
it doesn't block anything

1368
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,000
so i'm gonna i'm gonna i already down

1369
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,880
i already pointed savvy can to that uh

1370
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,319
dvc file

1371
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,480
so it already knows like uh what to look

1372
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,000
for so i'm going to click interpret

1373
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,079
files and it labels all the

1374
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,480
the all the packets that we have data

1375
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,400
for

1376
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,880
so one of this is i don't know what this

1377
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,160
actually is this is a break

1378
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,680
so it tells you if you're holding the

1379
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,000
break i think um

1380
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,880
i'll go to one that i'm familiar with so

1381
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:01,760
i'm just gonna

1382
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,520
take some deselect all the ids here

1383
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,000
and 14a so this is the steering sensor

1384
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,680
so it decodes all of this data

1385
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,598
into its individual components

1386
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,040
because there's no standard to how you

1387
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,920
can want how a designer can pack

1388
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,319
information into eight bytes

1389
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,839
they can do it however they want they

1390
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:34,960
can do it in one

1391
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,839
bit or they can do it in one byte or

1392
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:39,119
they can do it uh

1393
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,520
either or they can do it in a in a way

1394
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,559
that's not

1395
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,400
on a clean uh bite

1396
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,880
like a they can straddle two bites too

1397
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,400
right so

1398
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,200
so it's not a very clean uh way to do

1399
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:53,920
that

1400
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,760
so uh

1401
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,480
so i'm gonna demo so yeah this is

1402
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,119
so i think that's all i have just to

1403
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,799
show you on that

1404
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,920
uh actually i think i can see i'll show

1405
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,760
you how the

1406
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,960
and you don't want to edit a dbc file

1407
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,359
by hand because it's very error prone

1408
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,599
you want to use like a add an editor

1409
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,960
so let me find that steering wheel

1410
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,760
sensor again

1411
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,839
okay so look let's look at the signal

1412
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:34,079
cancel

1413
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,240
let's look at the signals here so let's

1414
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,079
look at the steering wheel angle

1415
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,680
so we defined it that five and six

1416
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,400
um is the byte are the two bytes that

1417
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,640
the steering angle is stored in

1418
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,119
so here i'll show you on the right side

1419
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,440
uh it's 16 bits so that's two bytes

1420
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,559
it's a signed integer uh and the scale

1421
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:55,359
value is

1422
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,079
negative 0.1 so basically what it does

1423
01:02:58,079 --> 01:02:59,520
is that it takes

1424
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,960
this signed integer and multiplies it by

1425
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,720
0.1 negative 0.1 bias is just

1426
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,599
it is a number that you add to this byte

1427
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:10,240
so here

1428
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,520
in this case is zero min value max value

1429
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,200
and unit's name these are all

1430
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,440
informational they don't actually affect

1431
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,240
anything

1432
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,799
so it just tells us like what we should

1433
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:23,039
be expecting

1434
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,050
and receiving nodes also

1435
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,400
[Music]

1436
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,640
what you call it also informational

1437
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,079
multiplexing i have no idea

1438
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,119
i never used that so

1439
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,799
and the cool thing about savvy can i

1440
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,799
want to show you guys before i forget

1441
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,799
is it has really good documentation so

1442
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,480
if i say savvy can

1443
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,119
and i type in signal editor into google

1444
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,119
uh the first link is

1445
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,319
um the documentation so it's i suggest

1446
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:52,720
like

1447
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,319
it's a good place to start if you guys

1448
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:57,119
can get it running on your systems

1449
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,440
and it's really really helped me out a

1450
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,359
lot

1451
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:05,760
um so okay where am i

1452
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,160
okay so i'll show you uh don i'll show

1453
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:08,880
you

1454
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,760
uh where i got my files so a couple

1455
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,000
people

1456
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,160
already mentioned it in chat it's called

1457
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,839
there's a company called comma ai

1458
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,640
and what they do

1459
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:23,599
i'll just get to your question in a

1460
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,680
second isaac what they do

1461
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,079
is well let's go to their website see a

1462
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:29,200
little maybe it's

1463
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,880
easier comma i think

1464
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,000
comma dot ai

1465
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,760
okay i guess it's not that ex uh uh

1466
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,000
maybe not explanatory

1467
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,520
so it's just like a self-driving car

1468
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,359
that you attach to

1469
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,480
connect to an um sorry self-driving

1470
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,160
module that you connect to

1471
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:56,160
an existing car uh so

1472
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,319
so here i don't know if you guys can see

1473
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,440
there's like a phone like

1474
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,799
thing here that's connected to the car

1475
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:06,000
behind the uh the reverse mirror i don't

1476
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,559
know what you call it

1477
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:11,440
a reverse mirror

1478
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,400
so it's connected into the can network

1479
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,839
that way

1480
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:17,280
and it just it just basically does

1481
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,720
something like a level two driving i

1482
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,280
think

1483
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,760
so we can do basically what a honda does

1484
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,480
so this is

1485
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,520
here you can see this toyota vehicle and

1486
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,000
toyota and honda vehicles only have like

1487
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,960
basic lane keep an advanced

1488
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,200
cruise control but this does a little

1489
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,280
bit more on that

1490
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,079
so for for that uh because of because of

1491
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:39,839
their needs what they did is that

1492
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,799
they started something called an opendbc

1493
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:43,760
file

1494
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,880
so here i i don't know if you guys can

1495
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,480
read this this is very small

1496
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,119
okay here you can see that they have

1497
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:52,160
files

1498
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,200
for a lot of models of vehicles so here

1499
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,240
there's only files

1500
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:01,119
that's

1501
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,720
the only focus on cars that have

1502
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,079
self-driving abilities so

1503
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,920
cars made uh from 2015 onwards

1504
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,240
uh so you if you if your car is like

1505
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,599
less than five years old

1506
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:16,240
it's likely that you have uh they

1507
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,440
already have uh

1508
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,319
some some of the canned messages decoded

1509
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,319
uh obviously they only care about

1510
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:25,359
the messages uh that

1511
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:28,000
they need for self-driving uh and this

1512
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,839
is all a lot of this is volunteer

1513
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:33,039
volunteer contributed so um so it all

1514
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,240
depends on

1515
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,079
the amount of data you get depends on

1516
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,760
the person who did the work

1517
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,680
so the minimum is all the steering

1518
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,200
actuators

1519
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,240
steering sensors uh kinematics radar

1520
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,760
and all that stuff so uh

1521
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,200
this is how i found my uh file

1522
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,680
but uh

1523
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,920
but let's say you didn't have that what

1524
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,000
would you do yep you had to decode stuff

1525
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,520
from

1526
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,160
uh every decode something from

1527
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,160
from nothing without any prior knowledge

1528
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,599
i think it's still good to go through

1529
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,280
dbc files

1530
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,359
to get a sense of how messages are

1531
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,599
structured even if you don't have

1532
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,039
the car so it'll get you in the mindset

1533
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,799
of how people lay out

1534
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:30,160
signals within messages yeah

1535
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,480
yeah uh there's a lot of questions that

1536
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,079
i went by so i'm just going to

1537
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,920
make sure i

1538
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,240
okay so there are some there's a couple

1539
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,240
of savvy can questions

1540
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,359
so i'm gonna

1541
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,520
uh hopefully this doesn't close down

1542
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,559
okay there we go

1543
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,160
so to load a dbc file you go into db

1544
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,720
file a bbc file manager and you

1545
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,799
you can either create a new dbc file or

1546
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,240
you can load one

1547
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,160
and you navigate to where you have it

1548
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,319
stored and you load it in

1549
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:09,359
so it's very simple and someone also

1550
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:13,440
asked how they can connect to vcan

1551
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:13,839
through

1552
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,319
uh savvy can so here you open up your

1553
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:17,600
connection settings

1554
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,479
from from this tab here then i'll just

1555
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:20,799
say

1556
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:24,158
add new connection savvy king connect

1557
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:26,319
can connect to a lot of different

1558
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:27,839
interfaces so if you have a serial

1559
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,158
connection if a network connection so

1560
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:31,839
you can connect to an ip address

1561
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,759
or you can connect to a socket cam like

1562
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,158
we discussed pecan

1563
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:38,238
tiny can i never use these terminal

1564
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,560
stuff so let's add another virtual

1565
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,439
network

1566
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:45,040
we can one so okay i don't know okay

1567
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,719
it's not connected because we don't have

1568
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,719
that interface existing so

1569
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,399
okay so i'm just going to scroll down

1570
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:58,479
okay so

1571
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:01,040
i forgot where i was going so yeah

1572
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,399
decoding files

1573
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:05,600
let's say you don't have um

1574
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,640
a bbc file like many people

1575
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,439
who have a carb from the 2000s early

1576
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:12,479
2000s

1577
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,759
so what's one thing you can do is that

1578
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,198
we can go through

1579
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:19,359
the same thing that we did before like i

1580
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,799
uh these are the files i

1581
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:23,679
i got i introduced you guys beforehand

1582
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:24,319
so

1583
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,359
um i recorded my crv in different

1584
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,799
states um so i'm gonna use python

1585
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,158
uh but we don't have to go through the

1586
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:34,719
uh you don't have to go through the code

1587
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,158
it's just basically the same thing i did

1588
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:38,399
before in the earlier demo

1589
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,479
uh i'm going to load it load all the

1590
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,839
logs into the

1591
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:45,040
sorry load all the logs into

1592
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,158
into the python tables

1593
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:50,880
um and and i'm going to compare the

1594
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,319
steering wheel log

1595
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:55,920
the unique ids uh from there

1596
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,679
to another uh to another table in this

1597
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,719
case idle

1598
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,280
when it was in idle mode so i'm going to

1599
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,239
see what ids

1600
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,959
the overlap

1601
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,640
so will asks does obd2

1602
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,760
specify a standard a set of messages so

1603
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,480
we can work on

1604
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,760
any any vehicle uh yes it's um

1605
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,239
i think they define like 10 or something

1606
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,199
uh that's only

1607
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,080
uh and and some of them the

1608
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,840
manufacturers have to implement

1609
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,320
and some of them they don't have to uh

1610
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,880
but it's very very basic information

1611
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,239
so uh you're not gonna get any

1612
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:39,920
uh any any anything uh uh useful out of

1613
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,239
it

1614
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:43,120
so if you ever had uh if you ever had a

1615
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,880
uh

1616
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,880
if you ever had to check an engine light

1617
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,159
and your uh

1618
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:51,199
mechanic runs something on it so that's

1619
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:51,679
what

1620
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:55,199
those standard commands uh will

1621
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,600
tries to find so there's nothing there's

1622
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,239
only like

1623
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:00,640
10 or some commands that it specifies

1624
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,679
everything else is up to the

1625
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:02,960
manufacturers

1626
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,520
so like i was saying before i'm

1627
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,480
comparing

1628
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,760
uh the steering wheel log file to

1629
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,880
when it's idle it's cut off here

1630
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,080
so but and i'm going to compare i'm

1631
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,440
comparing how many unique data frames

1632
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,560
each id has to another so

1633
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,880
as long as they're in both files yeah

1634
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,320
so so i'm just gonna

1635
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,239
so i'm looking i'm trying to find the

1636
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:33,600
steering wheel id

1637
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,120
uh we had so uh you can see this better

1638
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,320
on your pdfs

1639
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,719
but uh like i would like you to focus on

1640
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:41,520
this

1641
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,800
so in one file we have 291

1642
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,360
unique data data frames and the other

1643
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,360
one we only have 20.

1644
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,120
um uh so so that's one

1645
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,640
so let me go back to savvy can so let's

1646
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,199
uninterpret files so let's find that

1647
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,440
same packet again

1648
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,199
so and let's uh

1649
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,040
let's do which which is the

1650
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,480
which one do i want to do first

1651
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,640
i just want to see what how did i lay

1652
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,400
out my information

1653
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,480
so yeah i narrowed down to these two uh

1654
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,120
files are these two messages

1655
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,159
um then i'm gonna demo in

1656
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:28,239
in savvy can so there's something called

1657
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:29,600
the flow view

1658
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,600
and i'm gonna find the same packet we

1659
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,360
found before

1660
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,040
which is uh oh yeah first before i do

1661
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,480
this i have to load i have to clear

1662
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,679
these files

1663
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,280
and file load the steering wheel files

1664
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,840
so workshop files touring

1665
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,920
steering wheel turning right there we go

1666
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,960
so i'm going to clear all these flags

1667
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,920
uh 14 which is the one we found 14a

1668
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,159
there we go 14 in so then i'm going to

1669
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,280
go back in here

1670
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,560
and say flow view i guess it's behind

1671
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,920
here

1672
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,600
so this is very interesting i think you

1673
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,600
guys will like this so let's go find the

1674
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,840
same packet here

1675
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:19,920
14 hey there we go so here it graphs uh

1676
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,719
can you guys see this okay i don't i

1677
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:23,840
don't think it's being blocked by

1678
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,440
anything

1679
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:30,559
but we can just play back

1680
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,840
and we can see each line represents a

1681
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,199
particular data byte

1682
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,199
here uh i'm just going to stop it

1683
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,640
because it's very distracting

1684
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,960
so each line that represents a different

1685
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,719
uh byte

1686
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,000
um in a car sorry not in the car

1687
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,400
in that message uh and it's and it shows

1688
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,840
you how it changes

1689
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,159
um so if you guys notice so let's just

1690
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:53,199
start from the

1691
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:56,320
first uh yes we're on this

1692
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,480
first frame uh then i'm gonna play

1693
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,920
through it i'm gonna slow down the

1694
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,199
playback speed

1695
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,600
to something that we humans can keep up

1696
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,760
with so let's say a hundred

1697
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,480
so i'm gonna play it and notice how it's

1698
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,640
very still

1699
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,320
so i first recorded it while not moving

1700
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,199
a wheel

1701
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:17,920
so the steering sensor has no reason to

1702
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,800
input anything

1703
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,000
in a neutral position also um so and you

1704
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,560
notice

1705
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,960
that when it goes crazy that's when i'm

1706
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,600
turning it

1707
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,719
one way and the other way let's see

1708
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:33,199
okay there right here i think it'll just

1709
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:36,159
just jump up here i'm just going to stop

1710
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,239
it

1711
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,520
so so before from previous knowledge

1712
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,800
when we looked at our dbc

1713
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,440
file we knew that five and six were

1714
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,560
there are

1715
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,840
key um bytes that our steering wheel

1716
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,679
sensor is stored into it

1717
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,840
uh oh thanks isaac for the encouragement

1718
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,880
uh these uh

1719
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,640
five and six is the the place where it's

1720
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,480
uh those things are stored so

1721
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,719
yeah i'll explain what that flashing

1722
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:07,920
colors mean

1723
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,679
yeah uh so

1724
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,199
i want to see if i can i'm going to try

1725
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,760
to find it so uh

1726
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,640
let's i'm going to let's just go through

1727
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,600
our file so here

1728
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,880
i'm going to i'm going to try to go

1729
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,360
through slow so here you can notice that

1730
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,640
all the data packets are pretty constant

1731
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,159
and all of a sudden they start changing

1732
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:35,759
so here five and six

1733
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,679
so let's let's see saying this is the

1734
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:38,960
first data

1735
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,960
byte so zero one two three four five

1736
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,320
you know what this is not it's hard to

1737
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,880
see there's another tool i think i can

1738
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,239
maybe let's just stick with this for now

1739
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:51,600
let's just say you already knew that

1740
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,239
five and six you suspect five and six is

1741
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,840
where the data is stored

1742
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,000
uh but but you don't know if it's a

1743
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,679
signed int or if you don't you don't

1744
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,600
know if it's uh

1745
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,400
a normal integer or whatever so let's

1746
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:04,960
look at

1747
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,000
let's assume it's is stored in uh

1748
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,560
most significant bit first format so

1749
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,400
five is the the leading digit

1750
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,599
and six is the uh

1751
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,159
latter digit so six there's one cool

1752
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,440
feature here

1753
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,880
is i can enter a byte so it will

1754
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,120
it will play back the files and will

1755
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,760
stop at any frame that has

1756
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,040
uh ff in the sixth byte and i'll show

1757
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:31,440
you what

1758
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,880
what i mean what that means so nothing

1759
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,199
nothing

1760
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,719
so because the steering wheel is uh not

1761
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,400
being moved so there's no nothing

1762
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,000
so when the lights flash that's mean

1763
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,040
like there's uh database being changed

1764
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,320
so that's what the flashlight colors

1765
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,239
mean okay here

1766
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:59,280
uh hopefully it stops

1767
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,480
okay it's very complicated here

1768
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,360
i hope you guys can see it it's very

1769
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,320
very faint

1770
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:10,239
so five is yellow so here it goes from

1771
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:11,440
zero

1772
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,159
to uh to its full value to something

1773
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,120
about two

1774
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,320
250 some here and the

1775
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,600
six the kais the cyan goes to

1776
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,320
uh goes down

1777
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,719
uh so i'm gonna show you like i'm gonna

1778
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,880
show you and get it what i mean

1779
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,920
so so if you guys have any

1780
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,880
uh knowledge of let's just use decimal

1781
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,320
numbers so let's say it's 0

1782
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:44,080
1 0 2 0 3 and so on

1783
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,199
and let's skip to zero nine and it

1784
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:51,360
ends uh so it rolls over to ten right

1785
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:55,280
so one five uh so that's the same thing

1786
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,800
that's happening here

1787
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,920
uh the cyan so the lsp so the least

1788
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,040
significant byte

1789
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,080
is going to zero and zero uh sorry the

1790
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,320
yellow is going up to full

1791
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,159
now this doesn't really make sense

1792
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,360
because why would it go

1793
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,880
all the way to uh in this analog

1794
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,560
here it would be something like it's

1795
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,560
going all the way up to eight or nine

1796
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,159
eight or nine in the first leading digit

1797
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,719
right so then you have to remember oh

1798
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,880
this is a signed integer

1799
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,360
so it's when it when you the the leading

1800
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,159
bit

1801
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:31,199
if it's turned to uh if it if it's set

1802
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:34,320
to one that means it's a negative value

1803
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,080
so this is how you can tease out if it's

1804
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,440
uh what kind of

1805
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,000
integer uh it is if it's a float or if

1806
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:40,719
it's a

1807
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,320
i don't think you can do floats here but

1808
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,960
if it's an integer it's a signed integer

1809
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,600
or unsigned integer you know so on and

1810
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,080
so forth

1811
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,600
uh there's another tool also that uh

1812
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,840
that made me do it better for some

1813
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,960
frames

1814
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,440
so i'm gonna just close this close

1815
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,800
without saving

1816
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,080
i don't know if that made sense to

1817
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:07,280
people just just watching uh the bytes

1818
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,840
roll over

1819
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,599
making sense yes no

1820
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,560
i guess so

1821
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,159
um let's do uh

1822
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,840
we just did flowview yes we did just do

1823
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,520
floating now

1824
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:32,800
let's do signal view is that it no

1825
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,400
a temporal graph is something i can show

1826
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,000
you really quick it's very messy

1827
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,600
but uh you just you just

1828
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,960
highlight something it just

1829
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,000
graphs it whenever it sees a packet so

1830
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,199
you can see some packets are very

1831
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:55,360
very rarely occur and some packets are

1832
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,120
on all the time

1833
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,400
so this is like some very very easy

1834
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,440
uh tool to like see if there's any

1835
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,000
outliers

1836
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,159
but most of the time i didn't find much

1837
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:07,120
use for it

1838
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:11,840
but you may in your application but uh

1839
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:15,760
graph data no

1840
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,840
is it i'm just blanking right now ranged

1841
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,199
it that's what it is

1842
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,560
um okay so this is a pretty cool tool

1843
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,080
uh i'm just gonna select uh 14 and just

1844
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:28,560
another

1845
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:33,120
uh and we're gonna figure out if it's

1846
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,040
so let's say i ran the python analysis

1847
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,440
and i found out 14a

1848
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:41,840
uh uh is our file that we need

1849
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:46,080
or not files sorry our can

1850
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,080
id that's valuable to us for whatever

1851
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,360
reason so

1852
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,080
uh and we want to like parse figure out

1853
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,880
what kind of

1854
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,120
uh signals are stored within that

1855
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,000
message

1856
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,560
so uh and uh we can just

1857
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,639
one way of doing it it just basically

1858
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:04,639
try all permutations

1859
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:07,679
uh of how you can slice up that uh eight

1860
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:08,239
bytes

1861
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:12,880
into smaller into smaller um

1862
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,760
into signed end integer and you know do

1863
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:16,639
all these other

1864
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:19,600
permutations and just graph them and see

1865
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,080
how it

1866
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,120
uh and see what data makes sense

1867
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,719
so that's kind of what it's doing but

1868
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,239
it's in a more sensible

1869
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:30,159
way so we know our signal size

1870
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:34,480
is 2 bytes so this is 16 bits 16 bits

1871
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,520
and we can try both so

1872
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,560
so is it is it big edition i don't know

1873
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,600
how to pronounce that

1874
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,800
so that's msb or uh

1875
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,840
little idiom so which is uh ls uh

1876
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,199
least significant byte uh last

1877
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:54,080
or first i might have mixed those up but

1878
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,120
i think it's right

1879
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,960
so we can try both uh what granularity

1880
01:21:58,960 --> 01:21:59,679
is

1881
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:03,360
um i'll try to demonstrate it here

1882
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:07,519
so let's just open up our manager

1883
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,840
uh

1884
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,960
where do i open this

1885
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,159
edit there we go

1886
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,800
forgot how to open up my pvc file there

1887
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,800
we go

1888
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,199
edit

1889
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,880
okay

1890
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,280
you know what i'll just i'll just use it

1891
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,520
on a flow state so granularity what it

1892
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,199
does is

1893
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:41,199
uh let's say you're looking for a four

1894
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:43,199
byte four bit message

1895
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:45,760
uh and you have a granularity of one so

1896
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,440
it starts on a zeroth byte

1897
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,960
of uh of the message then it tests for a

1898
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,560
signal from here

1899
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,920
one two three four uh then it tries that

1900
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,360
uh then it moves up one and if it

1901
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,159
doesn't find anything it moves up one so

1902
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:02,960
one two three four so it keeps going so

1903
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,719
we are looking for 16 bits

1904
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:07,199
so it's going to move 16 bits up wide

1905
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:08,719
one bit every time

1906
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,800
so obviously the smaller your

1907
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,000
granularity is

1908
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,040
the more longer it will take

1909
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,239
so uh

1910
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:19,840
so let's just assume that they're gonna

1911
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,560
do it uh they're gonna

1912
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,679
place the uh the signal on a clean

1913
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,440
bite layer right so i'm sorry i closed

1914
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,880
it again

1915
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,480
so let's just assume that they're gonna

1916
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,560
only place a uh

1917
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,760
a new a new uh

1918
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,400
a signal on like about like a byte layer

1919
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:40,960
so here

1920
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:49,840
here here something like that okay um

1921
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,639
so many windows okay there so i'm just

1922
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:53,600
going to say that's why i'm going to say

1923
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,719
8 bits so

1924
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,719
we'll try on every bite layer then i'm

1925
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,159
going to recalculate signals

1926
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,080
oh i guess we found something here so we

1927
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,840
can see

1928
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,560
this is this starts on the 32nd bit and

1929
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,159
that's not what we

1930
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:16,080
found so if i go back to the flow view

1931
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,800
if i go back to the flow view and i say

1932
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:19,440
14a

1933
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,320
it's if we know it starts on the 47th

1934
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:22,639
bit

1935
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:27,440
so so let's just uh play around with our

1936
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,040
settings okay let's play around with our

1937
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:31,760
settings let's

1938
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,120
lower our granularity maybe that will

1939
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,159
help

1940
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:39,280
okay so it's i don't know if you guys

1941
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:44,159
can see

1942
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:47,360
so it sliced up all the

1943
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:51,120
the id uh id bytes um

1944
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,280
sorry it sliced up all the message bytes

1945
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,960
into different lengths

1946
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,920
uh so here it started at the fourth bit

1947
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,159
and read the next 16 bits

1948
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:05,120
in a signed a big idiom

1949
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,199
notation and this is what it this is

1950
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,480
what it got

1951
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,080
so we know our stuff started on the

1952
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,960
47th bit

1953
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,320
so here this is probably what what we're

1954
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,080
looking for right here so if you look

1955
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:20,639
back

1956
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,840
so we notice that it's 44.

1957
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,400
so that kind of makes sense so uh the

1958
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,360
first three uh

1959
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,480
digits or bits were probably blank

1960
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,920
so that's why i didn't pick up on that

1961
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,920
signal there so that's one way of

1962
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,840
finding signals within your data

1963
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,280
uh there's a lot of you can get like

1964
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:40,560
i don't want to do all of them but let's

1965
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,719
just do it with a larger

1966
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,560
data set and hopefully it doesn't break

1967
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,719
oh oh we were out of time i guess uh is

1968
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,960
it 9 30 that we're done den

1969
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,440
or is it uh yeah we've still got about a

1970
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,480
half an hour till

1971
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,880
uh until we get to the um keynote

1972
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,360
address and the hack at a prize ceremony

1973
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,800
so we've got some time maybe you want to

1974
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,040
leave 15 minutes or so for questions

1975
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,719
yeah i'm almost done so i thought i just

1976
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,800
went over time no no no we're good

1977
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,920
everybody's just talking about what time

1978
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,520
it is where they are

1979
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,840
okay okay so yeah so

1980
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,679
so we can look at other tools so

1981
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:23,199
so here it didn't really find anything

1982
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,520
in this data set but i hope you got some

1983
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,360
um some sense of when when you use this

1984
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:29,760
tool

1985
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,199
it's a really great tool for finding

1986
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,600
signals uh

1987
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,199
but i would i would recommend when

1988
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:37,040
whenever you're decoding signals

1989
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,800
is that you have some idea of how the

1990
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,800
signal uh

1991
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,600
will look like have a hypothesis like uh

1992
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,040
imagine put yourself in the designer

1993
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,760
shoes so let's say okay if i'm if i were

1994
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,440
the designer how would i store this

1995
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:55,840
signal into a message right and do a

1996
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,440
hypothesis that way

1997
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,000
and then do uh then test your hypothesis

1998
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,080
that's like much better than just

1999
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,920
generating a huge amount of signals and

2000
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,480
trying to go go through all of them

2001
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,080
it'll be it'll be uh it'll be

2002
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,320
overwhelming but sometimes you that's

2003
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:11,280
the only way

2004
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:15,520
but um but i would suggest put yourself

2005
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,880
into the designer to

2006
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,560
designers shoes for uh first

2007
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,520
so we did range state and flow view and

2008
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,000
this is

2009
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,760
really really cool um

2010
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:34,400
the next tool is okay let's do file

2011
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:39,360
what did i just say frame data analysis

2012
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,679
okay

2013
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,600
so let's go back to

2014
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,600
our steering data sensor is at 14a

2015
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,800
that's it

2016
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,440
um i know someone complained about

2017
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,880
seeing that

2018
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,960
it's all i saw was just flashing red

2019
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,719
when i was demonstrating a tool

2020
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,440
so you guys can see why that is so so

2021
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,000
the bottom

2022
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,639
axis is time so this is again looking at

2023
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:03,600
the steering

2024
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,239
wheel sensor so it's not emitting it's

2025
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,360
not changing anything

2026
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,800
and all of a sudden it just outputs a

2027
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,840
huge amount of data

2028
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,840
um

2029
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:22,400
okay uh so

2030
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,000
i think that might be uh

2031
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,679
so yeah so this this is a good way of

2032
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:30,400
figuring out um

2033
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,159
like where when to start looking at a

2034
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:33,520
byte uh

2035
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,880
or something so i'm just gonna look

2036
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,800
through some other

2037
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,760
things so this one's active all the time

2038
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,360
um

2039
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,040
so this is yeah this is constant so this

2040
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,560
might be like a temperature sensor or

2041
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,239
something like that

2042
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:49,599
where it's not changing all the time

2043
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,440
so i'm just going to just just give you

2044
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,080
an idea so

2045
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,639
i think that's is that all it no no i

2046
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:00,719
have to

2047
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,000
so yeah moving to the real world uh just

2048
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,159
a safety um on a safety thing careful

2049
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:08,560
being

2050
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:11,600
working in closed spaces here in canada

2051
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,520
it's getting cold very very cold

2052
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,040
so the temptation is to move into a

2053
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,800
closed space and uh

2054
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,320
and do it but like you're gonna get uh

2055
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,159
just be careful of co2 poisoning and

2056
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:20,800
stuff

2057
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,199
i would avoid working i would avoid

2058
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,120
working in enclosed spaces

2059
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,199
that's really really dangerous uh i

2060
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:28,320
would suggest blocking

2061
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,840
uh wheels off especially if you're

2062
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,600
injecting things

2063
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,679
into the car and even if you're not

2064
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:36,719
because if your hardware

2065
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,600
kind of spazzes out on you you don't

2066
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:40,800
want it to uh

2067
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,120
take off on you i know one of the act

2068
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,280
one actor got crushed by his car

2069
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:48,719
uh well not when he's hacking it

2070
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,639
but it just shifted gears and he just

2071
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:52,000
crushed him pushed him against

2072
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,600
the wall so it's very very dangerous

2073
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,360
it's like three to four thousand pound

2074
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,199
vehicles so we're dealing with so it's

2075
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:58,639
gonna win in a fight

2076
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:00,560
so another way after doing it is elevate

2077
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,080
a car on jack stands

2078
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,920
um if you if you've never done that

2079
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,360
before i would talk to

2080
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,199
friends who'd who done that before so

2081
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:09,839
they can teach you

2082
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,679
so and and when you're finding uh when

2083
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:16,159
you're

2084
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:18,400
when you're trying to find hardware find

2085
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,400
something with great documentation

2086
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,239
because this will save you hours and

2087
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:23,840
hours and hours of time

2088
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,199
so i made the uh mistake of uh

2089
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:29,360
choosing on hardware uh that's that was

2090
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,239
deprecated

2091
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,159
i didn't i didn't and i didn't realize

2092
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:34,080
it at the time so i had to like go

2093
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,199
through their uh

2094
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:38,080
thankfully it was uh all their files and

2095
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:38,639
stuff

2096
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,440
was on github but i had to like read all

2097
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,560
the files and

2098
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,639
figure out if it how to get it running

2099
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:45,600
so i must just

2100
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,040
burnt like 20 30 hours on that

2101
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:52,159
can particles you'll run into uh

2102
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:54,719
in the wild we didn't discuss it uh here

2103
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:56,800
so there's something called can fd

2104
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,000
so that expands the data length to 65

2105
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,040
64 bytes um and

2106
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,960
this is this should be only you'll only

2107
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,719
see this on like newer vehicles

2108
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:09,520
i think uh it's 2018 and onwards but

2109
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,400
it's not going to be in

2110
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:13,920
every uh every car and this is like

2111
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,600
much much more faster uh data

2112
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,000
a data rate a bandwidth sorry then what

2113
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:20,960
we looked at

2114
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,880
what i never i'm not going to speak more

2115
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,400
on this because i don't know i never

2116
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,440
used one

2117
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:29,120
and there's another thing called uh

2118
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,320
i iso uh i think i misspelled this it's

2119
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,600
iso tp i think not t top uh so this

2120
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,239
is basically this is a protocol that

2121
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:39,760
let's say you have a byte that's

2122
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,800
larger than eight bytes and you want to

2123
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,600
uh pack a package them across uh

2124
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,840
differing uh multiple frames

2125
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,120
uh this is a standard that tells you uh

2126
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,679
how to do that so i never ran into this

2127
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:54,800
i'm not gonna speak on

2128
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:59,600
on it so it can open another network so

2129
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,600
another not network but another standard

2130
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,040
i guess so

2131
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,639
so these are something to be aware of

2132
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:08,880
um

2133
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,239
so so selecting hardware so

2134
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:17,840
cost is the big uh issue uh so

2135
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,040
uh the one i chose was like a 130. it's

2136
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:24,080
it's comma ai's uh like a ca um can

2137
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:24,960
reader

2138
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,120
but they deprecated it so it's not

2139
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,159
something i would recommend

2140
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,520
so the cost varies on based on

2141
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,320
how fast it can read and how much memory

2142
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,280
it has

2143
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,520
so if if you choose a device with a

2144
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,840
small

2145
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,440
amount of data memory it's going to keep

2146
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,280
dropping bytes and you're going to have

2147
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,800
a hard time trying to find the packet

2148
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,080
you're looking for

2149
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,400
because it's it's never captured and

2150
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:51,199
you're going to

2151
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:55,120
chase your tail so um and form factor if

2152
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,560
you want something that's small and can

2153
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,080
connect into

2154
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,960
uh can connect into your obd port

2155
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,639
without

2156
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:06,000
being obtrusive that's going to cost you

2157
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,280
and especially if you want to read if

2158
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,480
you want something that can read on

2159
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,520
multiple

2160
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,719
can and other um

2161
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:16,719
uh another bosses simultaneously

2162
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:18,320
without dropping anything that's also

2163
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:21,280
going to cost you a lot so

2164
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,520
and and also you should look at uh what

2165
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,199
kind of api

2166
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,120
it will support out of the box so socket

2167
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:28,880
can serial whatever

2168
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,520
so so that's like one less thing you

2169
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,400
have to implement

2170
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,040
to get it to work with what you want a

2171
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,320
logic analyzer might

2172
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,960
be the best place to start uh i have

2173
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,480
something called uh

2174
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,679
discovery analog discovery something

2175
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:44,480
like that

2176
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,120
and it supports it um but you just have

2177
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,560
to be careful because the can i think

2178
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,400
signals is at 12 volts

2179
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:51,760
plus or minus 12 volt and you have to

2180
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,080
drop it down to 3.3 volts

2181
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:57,440
um and i'm going to recommend you a book

2182
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:00,000
called uh

2183
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,840
car hackers handbook it was written in

2184
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,080
2016.

2185
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:07,120
um it still it's some of it's out of

2186
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,239
date but it's most of it is really

2187
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:09,199
really good

2188
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:12,239
um and that's like that's a good place

2189
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:13,199
to start

2190
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:15,440
uh if you want to get more into beats or

2191
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,280
i'm just

2192
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,320
uh gonna how do i get to

2193
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,639
so i'll just i'll just show you the

2194
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:23,920
table of contents

2195
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,040
what it covers so it covers like sdr

2196
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,400
stuff if you want to try

2197
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,440
uh attacking the wireless stuff um

2198
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,520
if you want to attack the ecu which is i

2199
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,600
think the engine control unit

2200
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,239
so there's like a lot more stuff in here

2201
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,679
than i did that i didn't cover

2202
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:43,840
so this is a good place to start um

2203
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,280
uh we yeah so that's the thing and open

2204
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,280
garages has an email list

2205
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:52,560
um i'm not sure how oh i guess i didn't

2206
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:53,280
copy the thing

2207
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,760
i'm not sure how active their email list

2208
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,760
is

2209
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,679
i'll update the file and put it back up

2210
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:00,960
with the actual link

2211
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,639
it's not very active but it's it's a

2212
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,639
google forms uh google email list i

2213
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:04,960
think

2214
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,639
so it's very searchable so so comma ai

2215
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:10,400
is also the thing i we talked about

2216
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,440
before so they have a github with

2217
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,800
like almost in their entire product

2218
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,119
open source so it's a very very good

2219
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:20,560
place to look into

2220
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,679
so we we discussed the opendbc files

2221
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:28,800
before um

2222
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,119
and uh one other tool i ran out across

2223
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:32,239
into i'm just still

2224
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:34,639
figuring out how to use it there's not

2225
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:36,400
so much for reverse engineering

2226
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,119
but if you're developing uh can networks

2227
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:39,920
uh can dev

2228
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,960
studio is a cool thing to start

2229
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,080
it can simulate you can set up

2230
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,880
cam networks and simulate it i'm not

2231
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,000
going to spend too much time on here

2232
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,080
because i haven't used it too much

2233
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,840
but it's something you may want to look

2234
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,239
into

2235
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:59,599
uh any questions

2236
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:04,638
okay we have 20 minutes yeah

2237
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:10,320
so there's one chat there yeah greg asks

2238
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,239
amit in your experience are current gen

2239
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,760
cars implementing

2240
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,600
any measures specifically to prevent

2241
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,159
manipulation injection of messages or

2242
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:19,360
all

2243
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,679
are all are the can buses basically a

2244
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:22,639
free-for-all

2245
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:25,520
so yeah uh you know that on the car door

2246
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,480
uh

2247
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,560
trick i showed you about recording the

2248
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,480
can messages and playing it back

2249
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,679
uh that may not work on uh

2250
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,920
a lot of cars because basically on the

2251
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,719
obd port they might put a firewall

2252
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:41,600
and the only uh and the firewall

2253
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,880
prevents

2254
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,800
only allows certain certain

2255
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:53,040
messages from getting through so um uh

2256
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,560
so yeah so you're not that's going to be

2257
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,199
a limitation

2258
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:03,040
okay so let's see don asks our can id is

2259
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:03,440
from

2260
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:07,280
uh tp tmps dashboard light

2261
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,440
manufacturer specific or standard i'm

2262
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,880
not really sure about that

2263
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:14,639
and uh i don't know how that functions

2264
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:18,400
uh so you have to look it up and there's

2265
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,199
a lot of hacks

2266
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:20,880
been done around that so if you just

2267
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,040
google around it you'll find something

2268
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,280
um what's the advantage of running can

2269
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,159
at

2270
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:29,199
12 volts uh i'm not really sure i think

2271
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:29,760
that just

2272
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,600
historically how it happened how it

2273
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,040
worked because i think the car battery's

2274
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,480
at 12 volts right for most

2275
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:38,638
things so maybe it's that um

2276
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,239
so yeah alex says that tpms is

2277
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:45,280
manufacturer specific

2278
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:50,000
uh will will asks are there a lot of

2279
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,520
response messages

2280
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,920
for instance drivetrain systems sending

2281
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,040
response messages

2282
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:59,199
to steering input um

2283
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:03,119
uh

2284
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:06,159
uh i'm not sure uh i haven't

2285
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:08,719
uh look i haven't dealt with anything

2286
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:09,760
that requires

2287
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,760
sense and receives the command i looked

2288
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,040
at on a very uh

2289
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,320
very very straightforward things like

2290
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,560
steering wheel sensors uh whether your

2291
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,080
foot's on the brake brake

2292
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:21,119
pressure acceleration

2293
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,320
stuff like that i haven't looked at

2294
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,320
anything that's more complicated than

2295
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,040
than that alex says it's cans a plus or

2296
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:27,920
minus five volts

2297
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,960
so that's my bad um

2298
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,840
you can reach out uh isaac asks me how

2299
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,920
how it you can connect to me

2300
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,159
you can send me an email at uh i don't

2301
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:39,119
want to say it here

2302
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:40,800
but you can you can reach out to through

2303
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,960
me

2304
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,280
you can reach out to me through

2305
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:46,560
hackaday.io

2306
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,480
so there's a public chat and you can we

2307
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,679
can talk there and you can direct

2308
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:51,360
message me i think too

2309
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,599
so

2310
01:38:57,199 --> 01:38:59,040
okay greg says that there's a better

2311
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,639
signal integrity with

2312
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:03,040
plus or minus 12 volts or a 5 volts so

2313
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,080
that's that's good to know

2314
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:11,520
anything else i can help anyone with i'm

2315
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:12,639
sorry that everyone

2316
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:14,639
everyone couldn't get uh their thing set

2317
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:16,719
up uh

2318
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:18,560
it's it's a little complicated thing to

2319
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,080
set up so

2320
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,000
i hope everyone got some use out of it

2321
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,080
anyway

2322
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,760
i have a kind of an oddball question

2323
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,440
here that might be a little bit out of

2324
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,800
your wheelhouse but

2325
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,400
okay i'm just kind of curious the the

2326
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:36,000
it appears that newer cars have um

2327
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,600
uh actuators and and

2328
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,040
you know on the steering system and

2329
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,560
sensors for steering angle and stuff

2330
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,159
like that which

2331
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:46,800
is news to me i'm kind of of a luddite

2332
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,119
when it comes to cars i like a mold but

2333
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:52,559
um is that

2334
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,040
when when about did that start is it

2335
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,800
really just for cars that can do

2336
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,960
like you know lane departure correction

2337
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,719
and things like that or

2338
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:03,520
yeah so uh anything anytime you need uh

2339
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,440
it needs to correct the steering

2340
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,600
a steering wheel like uh so lane keepers

2341
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,480
assist

2342
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,800
so i think in my car my old accord used

2343
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,679
to

2344
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:14,880
old is 2015 but it used to kind of

2345
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,040
fight get uh fight you if you're

2346
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,080
drifting out of

2347
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:22,639
a lane so uh and uh and more

2348
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:25,440
like uh some stuff some cars uh even my

2349
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:26,400
accord uh

2350
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:29,280
according hrv can navigate curves on

2351
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:29,920
their own

2352
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,920
so in addition to cruise control they

2353
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,400
can take some basic curves not something

2354
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:37,040
crazy so they can take basic curves as

2355
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,080
well so

2356
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:40,320
yeah so anything that has like uh the

2357
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,360
advanced stuff

2358
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:45,360
like the uh automatic braking lane keep

2359
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,360
uh that's where you find these systems

2360
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,520
before that there's no need for uh

2361
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:53,360
it to uh exist i think also like some

2362
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:56,560
cars had sell auto parking so

2363
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:57,920
it might have also been implemented

2364
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,280
there so that's that might have been

2365
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:00,320
before

2366
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:03,600
uh this all this lane keeping scene okay

2367
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,480
cool well maybe one day i'll buy a new

2368
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:07,040
car and

2369
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:10,159
have something to play with too i think

2370
01:41:10,159 --> 01:41:12,480
you can still do some a hacks

2371
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,320
with with the older stuff i haven't done

2372
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,159
this but you can i know people try to

2373
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:17,440
mess with their ecu to get more

2374
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,440
horsepower or different performance

2375
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:20,880
so yeah that's something you might want

2376
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,560
to try but you can break it so

2377
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,960
that's not that's the only downside

2378
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,960
practice on a rental car

2379
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,199
yeah one thing i saw like if you look at

2380
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:31,280
the car hackers handbook

2381
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,400
is that they they pull out uh old parts

2382
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,159
from like wrecked cars

2383
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:37,920
so especially if your car is popular you

2384
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,000
might be able to find salvage components

2385
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,199
and just run them up independently and

2386
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:45,360
uh and just test on like isolated

2387
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:46,400
components

2388
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,840
and just hook it up to power and see

2389
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,280
what it sends and you can input

2390
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,560
something to it

2391
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,000
they cover it more in the car hackers

2392
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,320
handbook but that's something that's

2393
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,400
something you can guys can do it

2394
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,000
look into if you're trying to do

2395
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,679
something more intrusive and you don't

2396
01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:01,040
want to break a vehicle and you just

2397
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:01,600
want to

2398
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:04,639
mess around with something simple okay

2399
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:05,840
cool thanks

2400
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,840
uh before we lose too many more people

2401
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,920
which we haven't lost that many but

2402
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,000
we still got uh quite a few and i want

2403
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,119
to make sure we put in a pitch for um

2404
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:18,159
the uh um the keynote address that's

2405
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:18,800
coming up

2406
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,920
in 13 minutes or so plus

2407
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,880
uh the the hackaday prize ceremony so we

2408
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,400
get to find out who won the hackaday

2409
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,960
prize this year so make sure i put the

2410
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,800
link in there that's a live stream go

2411
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,920
and go and check that out um if you

2412
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:36,320
are so inclined anybody else have any

2413
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:36,960
questions

2414
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,360
we could probably uh free up some mics

2415
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,400
now if you want to just

2416
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,839
ask instead of type

2417
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:54,159
and i'll be available on the public chat

2418
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:55,440
so if you guys want to ask me questions

2419
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,839
later on

2420
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:08,800
i'm glad you guys enjoyed uh enjoyed it
