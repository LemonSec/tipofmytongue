2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,960
welcome everyone

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,080
uh depending on your time zone good

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,480
morning good afternoon and good evening

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,639
uh this is remote con 2020 my name is

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,480
bruce dominguez i'm here as your

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,680
uh kind of mc moderator for

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,880
our uh event and uh

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,840
today we'll be talking with uh alex

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,760
whitmore and alex is an electronic

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,080
prototype engineer who specializes in

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,760
turning napkin sketches

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,079
into proof of concepts with a path to

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,280
production

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,520
so welcome everyone to the basics of rf

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,879
admissions debugging

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,839
with alex whitmore

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,000
thank you much so uh

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,160
yeah we're basically here to figure out

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,840
uh what you do

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
about fixing a product that

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,039
failed an rf emissions test and we'll

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,559
start from the beginning and

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,840
dive right in um let me figure out how

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,800
to share

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,959
just my one window

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,240
there we go all right um so first things

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,720
first

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,920
these slides are available as a public

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,880
link right now

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,840
and i kind of suggest that you go find

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,560
that link

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,820
and download them um

34
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,080
[Music]

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,759
and follow along from home because there

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,119
are a bunch of live links throughout the

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:23,759
slides

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,600
and i think everyone's path in this is

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,880
going to be slightly different as you

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,000
follow along and

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,759
and realize some software doesn't work

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,040
for you or there's some problem or

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,600
whatever

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,680
i'm trying to allow for a whole bunch of

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,799
time for

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,079
like live debugging of this um

47
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,280
i believe that link is already in chat

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,720
so like scroll up to the top and see if

49
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,600
you can find it

50
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,479
i'll uh i'll repost it uh because

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,079
sometimes i think that

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,680
once you enter in at a certain point it

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,200
doesn't log in yeah

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
yeah if it was before then yeah yeah i

55
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,640
just reposted it

56
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,000
okay cool um yeah so background

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
uh first slide has a link to the setup

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
instructions that i tried to post

59
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,479
um some instructions weeks ago i know

60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,159
some people have been following along i

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,680
kind of don't expect that everyone will

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,720
have um so we're gonna have to

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,640
like catch up as we go and i'll try to

64
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,760
circle back around

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,239
um keep the chat lively with problems

66
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,680
that i know miss having so that

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,640
everyone can flag me down and and turn

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,319
me back around if uh

69
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,360
if some help needs to be pointed out or

70
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,680
or

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,879
there are issues that everyone's having

72
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,959
that i haven't or something like that um

73
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,360
in particular what we'll need to set up

74
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,480
before we get started

75
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,120
is um obviously physical materials on

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,000
your workbench

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
um an sdr tool chain and the

78
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
tool chain for programming a tiny fpga

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
um

80
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,640
the instructions like i said are up for

81
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,120
that and in a perfect world

82
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,480
the best way to go about

83
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,239
uh doing that is to just like download

84
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,440
the pre-made virtual machine that i've

85
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,000
got but

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,640
we'll get there anyway so first things

87
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,000
first what do you actually need

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,040
on your workbench uh it should look

89
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,239
kind of sort of something like this um

90
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,400
i told everyone to grab the nesdr smarty

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
just because it has a built-in biases

92
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,599
for powering

93
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,680
the low noise amplifier i also pointed

94
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,440
out you don't need these per se

95
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,640
but you do need an rcl sdr that you can

96
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,480
run and a low noise amplifier

97
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,680
that you know how to turn on um and then

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,519
i have some probes that i've already

99
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,959
made

100
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,440
and of course a tiny fpga vx for

101
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,560
demo purposes demo signal purposes uh

102
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,080
you definitely don't need this

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,440
rsa that luckily a client rented for me

104
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,040
so we'll be able to have a look at what

105
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,440
you would be doing if you had my um

106
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,480
and then above and beyond that um

107
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,319
since i imagine a lot of you will be

108
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,000
building probes live as we go through

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,879
the workshop

110
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
uh it would probably be a good idea to

111
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,400
have a soldering iron handy

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,120
um and your magnet wire and and sma

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,400
connectors if you haven't already built

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,280
probes

115
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,400
um and ideally some other boards to

116
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,640
probe around as well like you see the

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,239
the alka-tree au over here that i've got

118
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,280
um i've got some interesting interesting

119
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,519
investigations to show on that and like

120
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,720
i'm sure

121
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,560
an arduino will probably work there are

122
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,079
probably countless boards that

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,400
that might do the trick um the long and

124
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,440
short of it is

125
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,840
we're limited in what we can see by the

126
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,880
sdr because it

127
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,320
bottoms out at 25 megahertz and

128
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,440
uh we need a signal higher than that in

129
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,639
order to see it at all

130
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,440
that's really the only issue here um but

131
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
yeah bring along your own boards and

132
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
we'll have a look at them later because

133
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,759
there are certainly a lot of interesting

134
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,680
things to be seen on your own

135
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,000
um there we go

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,400
um so first things first software setup

137
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,120
uh the

138
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,440
tools that i plan on using in this

139
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,520
workshop primarily our cue spectrum

140
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,240
analyzer

141
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,479
um obviously i'll walk through all this

142
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,440
stuff but

143
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,080
uh that basically approximates a

144
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,240
traditional swept spectrum analyzer

145
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,840
using any of a handful of sdr devices

146
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,120
and in particular our

147
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,320
rtl sdr so that's super useful here

148
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,360
and then sdr angel is the

149
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,120
best general purpose uh sdr

150
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,039
tool that i've come across for

151
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,880
taking a spectrum because it offers a

152
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
lot of like like fake digital phosphor

153
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,880
features which we'll get into why that

154
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,160
looks pretty and it'll be pretty obvious

155
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,440
as soon as we dive in

156
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,840
that's the best one generally speaking

157
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,800
if you can get

158
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,360
any spectrum with your sdr at all you're

159
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,800
in good shape so like even if you're

160
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,520
using

161
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,120
um gqrx or like something like that

162
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
if you can see a spectrogram you can

163
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
follow along

164
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,759
um if you can't

165
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,759
then that's a little bit of a problem i

166
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,600
recommend everyone download this

167
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
virtualbox vm that i put together with

168
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,360
dragon os lts

169
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
setting up all of these tools is kind of

170
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,479
the worst and it's

171
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,160
very platform and system dependent

172
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,840
whether it whether it works or whether

173
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,199
it goes smoothly or whether whether it

174
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,400
doesn't at all

175
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,680
um this vm i know works in virtualbox at

176
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,039
least on my machine

177
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,600
the performance is not that great so if

178
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
you're on windows i recommend you

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,479
try to install the vmware workstation

180
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,160
and import the virtual machine into that

181
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
and run it that way

182
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,520
um if you're on mac download the trial

183
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,800
of parallels desktop

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,160
the performance there is a whole lot

185
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,240
better than virtualbox especially for

186
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,680
like usb passthrough

187
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,400
and things of that nature which we'll be

188
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
making heavy use of

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,319
um but if you can just get it open in

190
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,680
virtual box

191
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,880
you will at least be able to follow

192
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,199
along and i'll uh show you the tips and

193
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,160
tricks for

194
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,840
maximizing your performance when we get

195
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,000
there

196
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,440
um ditto tiny fpga um

197
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
long story short install adam follow the

198
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
instructions at that link

199
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,759
um if you just google tiny fpga bx setup

200
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,960
instructions that's what i

201
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,880
followed um and then clone the

202
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,400
repository

203
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,199
that i linked for this project the long

204
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,240
and short of the code

205
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,400
is that it spins up a pll and attaches

206
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,319
some signals to some pins it's not very

207
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,440
complicated

208
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,000
um do your best not to poke through it

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,039
yet because

210
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,599
like we'll have fun modifying it what

211
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,960
not later

212
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,479
um okay so a little bit of a back

213
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,319
background for what we're trying to

214
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,680
accomplish here in the first place

215
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,960
what is rf compliance to begin with i'm

216
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,280
sure

217
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,520
most of you here already know on the

218
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,800
basis that you're interested

219
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,840
but every electronic product

220
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,960
uh spams a bunch of

221
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,199
rf interference out into the environment

222
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
as a simple byproduct of operating

223
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,800
um obviously some of those signals are

224
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,000
very deliberate and have a specific

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,720
function like

226
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,639
wi-fi a camera or a laptop or whatever

227
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,000
it is a cell phone

228
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,680
has a wi-fi radio um it emits signals

229
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,160
those affect other devices nearby in a

230
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,599
very calculated and specific and

231
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,599
standardized way to make things happen

232
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,639
but it turns out you can do that

233
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,160
same emitting um in a not calculated

234
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,639
not standardized and not anticipated way

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,080
that breaks things

236
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
um so the whole point of rf compliance

237
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,160
is testing to make sure that you're not

238
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,400
falling into that category of device

239
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,280
and in particular and i apologize it's a

240
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,720
very global conference

241
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,000
um and i do not know global rules

242
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,840
uh also i should back up and say i'm

243
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,440
certainly not an expert in this

244
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
uh this is my recent experience going

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,039
through this myself

246
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,159
uh with some novelty added on top

247
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,640
um i know only fcc rules and only

248
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,360
vaguely

249
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,200
there is basically a corollary to all of

250
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,519
this in every other country on earth so

251
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,440
your own rules will vary but they will

252
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,959
probably look pretty similar

253
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,320
so in particular in the us in the uh fcc

254
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,279
specification

255
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,399
part 15 subpart b governs unintentional

256
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,640
radios which are devices that

257
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
don't have a wireless communications

258
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,360
function or anything like that they're

259
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,000
not intended to create rf energy

260
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,880
um they might cause accidental or

261
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,240
incidental interference with other

262
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,120
devices

263
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,560
and then fcc part 15 subpart c

264
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,399
governs intentional radiators so this is

265
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,240
the certification you have to get if you

266
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,399
have implemented a wireless protocol or

267
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,360
radio and

268
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,480
intend to broadcast effectively loud

269
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,760
rf signals um how does

270
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
testing work so when you actually have

271
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
to go through the process of getting a

272
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,240
part 15b or part 15c certification for

273
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,600
your product

274
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,760
what actually happens when we try to do

275
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,360
that well you

276
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,279
google around online you find a lab that

277
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,760
advertises is capable of ul testing

278
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,360
and you send them your product and

279
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
three to thirty thousand dollars later

280
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
they send you your product back and a

281
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,640
piece of paper that says

282
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,839
you did not pass your test report um

283
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,360
to get to that point they put your

284
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,200
device inside a big faraday cage

285
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,760
just a wall or a room full of metal

286
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,320
walls

287
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,839
so that no external signals can leak in

288
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,920
uh they point a big expensive antenna at

289
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,360
it and they

290
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,440
turn it on and spin it around on a lazy

291
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,800
susan on a wooden table

292
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,720
um i think the tables are probably

293
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,920
expensive too although they don't have

294
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,959
to be

295
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,880
um and then they measure that antenna

296
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,800
with a big expensive spectrum analyzer

297
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,040
and i'll touch on why it's big and

298
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,399
expensive but

299
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,160
at least for our purposes you don't need

300
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,240
to approximate this setup

301
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,760
so the real point of this setup is it

302
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,279
uh creates a calibrated um

303
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,760
and baselined test report that says your

304
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,720
product is emitting

305
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,880
exactly this much energy at such and

306
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
such a frequency and that is above the

307
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,440
limit

308
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,200
that's where you have a problem and

309
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,880
basically all of the money in this setup

310
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,839
goes into actually having calibrated

311
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,800
output

312
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,079
so what happens when you get this test

313
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,640
report back well you probably failed you

314
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,040
get back a sheet that looks like this

315
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,680
and you have to figure out why you

316
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,560
failed and

317
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,680
what you're going to do about it so

318
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,079
at this point you're probably terribly

319
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,839
confused you probably had an inkling

320
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,279
that your product was going to fail but

321
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,160
you knew that

322
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
spending three thousand dollars for a

323
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,839
part b

324
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,880
uh certification was like the first step

325
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,440
to

326
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,760
figuring out what to do about it um but

327
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,519
now you're a little bit confused

328
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,800
what does this test report actually mean

329
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,959
other than that red line crossing that t

330
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,560
line is a little bit scary oh

331
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,279
you guys can't see my pointer when i'm

332
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,120
sharing this window can you

333
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,279
you can okay cool that makes things

334
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,040
easier um

335
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
obviously where the red line crosses the

336
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,240
limit line

337
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,279
that's not great something has gone

338
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,320
wrong

339
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
but it isn't actually that

340
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,079
straightforward what to do

341
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,480
about it or or how to even read this

342
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,040
report so like

343
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,440
uh let's look at what this report is

344
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,279
actually saying from the get go

345
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,639
so first things first there are a couple

346
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,399
of different standards for testing

347
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,000
there is um measurement distance

348
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,839
uh and which range of spectrum

349
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,519
you're trying to measure so in this

350
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,200
particular case this section of the test

351
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,639
report is covering the frequency

352
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,399
spectrum from 30 megahertz to a thousand

353
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,000
megahertz uh the sub gigahertz

354
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,519
region and this is specified

355
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,760
at 10 meters so basically the receive

356
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,440
antenna is 10 meters away from our

357
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,800
product while they're spinning it around

358
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,079
on that table

359
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,839
um which means mostly it just means that

360
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,800
this is the

361
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,959
limit line we choose there's also a

362
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,880
testing regime at three meters with a

363
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,959
slightly higher limit line

364
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,480
um but as far as i'm aware most people

365
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,040
use 10 meters for this certification

366
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,480
um that antenna um

367
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,959
being an electromagnetic device has a

368
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,480
polarization it's

369
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,519
um it's i guess

370
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,600
i guess horizontally or vertically

371
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,959
polarized depending on the physical

372
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,560
orientation of the antenna

373
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,880
um in the last slide you can

374
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,519
you can see that it's clearly got some

375
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,519
asymmetrical geometry to it

376
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,680
um so one of these lines was taken with

377
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,399
that antenna rotated vertically

378
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,760
and one of them was taken with that

379
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,519
antenna rotated horizontally

380
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,600
and you have to pass both of those tests

381
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,560
in order to

382
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,120
to pass your test so let's look at what

383
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,320
the

384
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,760
actual uh tabular data of this report

385
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,959
says

386
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,440
um and by the way this is for a real

387
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,000
product

388
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,440
um that obviously failed and i'll dig

389
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,120
into why a little bit

390
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,480
um it's a little bit scary at least

391
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,079
reading this test report the first time

392
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,920
because obviously this this red line

393
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,440
crosses the limit line in a bunch of

394
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,399
different spots

395
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,199
so up here in the debug frequencies list

396
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,079
we see

397
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,519
there's a worrying peak at 36

398
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,399
ish megahertz so that's like this guy

399
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,600
there's another one at

400
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,120
70 megahertz so i think that's this one

401
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,639
um there's another one at 250 megahertz

402
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,959
that's these two big peaks

403
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,519
and so on and so forth so okay we've got

404
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,480
to go

405
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,160
figure out what on our product is

406
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,079
emitting rf interference

407
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,760
at those frequencies and tamp that down

408
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,199
right well not exactly

409
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,160
so the way this test report is generated

410
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,519
is sort of in two steps

411
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
um i told you that you use a big

412
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,680
expensive spectrum analyzer to

413
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,040
to measure this right for a little bit

414
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,880
of background about spectrum analysis

415
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,079
in case you aren't super rf inclined

416
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,079
i don't know how many people are

417
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,760
watching will be or won't be

418
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,399
so bear with me if this is old hat but

419
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,360
um

420
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,399
measuring the frequency domain uh of

421
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,519
a signal you can do

422
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,440
a couple of different things like your

423
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,880
your test equipment can take a couple of

424
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
different tactics to measure that

425
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,199
um for time immemorial the only

426
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,399
practical way to do this is basically

427
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,440
make a device that measures the received

428
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,000
power

429
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,959
at a specific frequency and then just

430
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,320
move that specific

431
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,720
tune that specific frequency through

432
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,440
time

433
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,639
um ideally as quickly as you can

434
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,639
but listening to this frequency then

435
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,839
move to the next frequency and listen

436
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,959
then move to the next frequency and

437
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,240
listen and so on

438
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,360
that's swept spectrum spectrum analysis

439
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,560
um this first phase of the test

440
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,360
where it lists debug frequencies is

441
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,480
sweeping the spectrum

442
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,320
analyzer across the entire spectrum and

443
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,800
looking for only the peaks

444
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,040
at each point um so looking for the

445
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,120
absolute maximum value of rf power that

446
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,079
we see

447
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,199
for every point in that spectrum well

448
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,360
devices behave differently throughout

449
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,560
time and

450
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,720
maybe your device is chirping really

451
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,959
loudly for a moment

452
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,279
oh good my camera's charging sorry

453
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,320
distracting myself

454
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,839
maybe your device is chirping really

455
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,079
loudly for a moment um but it doesn't do

456
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,519
that all that frequently

457
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,560
and like maybe your device

458
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,360
only makes a loud burst of 250 megahertz

459
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,920
when it first

460
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,639
turns on or something like that or maybe

461
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,519
it does it for

462
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,519
one millisecond every 100 milliseconds

463
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,959
and it turns out that doesn't actually

464
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,720
really cause any interference on any

465
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,959
adjacent devices so even though the peak

466
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,079
is really high

467
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,600
the uh power that matters as far as

468
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,560
causing interference

469
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,600
isn't actually that high

470
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,880
for those of you who know what you're

471
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,040
talking about in rf this is about the

472
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,399
edge of my

473
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,399
experience and knowledge here but the

474
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,320
gist of it is that

475
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,120
the first pass of of peak detection

476
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,800
gives you an idea of where to look

477
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,959
for potentially offending and failing

478
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:47,839
signals

479
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,360
and then you go back and do what's

480
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,839
called a quasi-peak analysis

481
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,560
uh or rather quasi-max power analysis i

482
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,680
don't even know if i'm saying that right

483
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,560
i'm sorry

484
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,360
where okay we see in this particular

485
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,920
device

486
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,000
that there's a really really bad peak at

487
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,360
250 megahertz

488
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,559
so let's flip the spectrum analyzer into

489
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,039
quasimax analysis mode we listen at just

490
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,199
that relatively narrow bandwidth

491
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,199
and move the product all which ways

492
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,640
until we can

493
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,599
you know us you know say that it's it's

494
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,400
either

495
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,359
emitting or not emitting uh an offending

496
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,640
frequency

497
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,959
at a certain power um and then move on

498
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,640
and do the next one instead of sweeping

499
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,720
quickly past and just taking the peak

500
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,080
um for this particular product what we

501
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,760
see is that the

502
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,280
peaks out here uh this 36 megahertz peak

503
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,640
the 70 megahertz peak and all the rest

504
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,200
of it

505
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,559
those aren't actually um

506
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,840
violations at

507
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
uh you know from a standpoint of passing

508
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,039
or failing the the

509
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,039
report passing or failing the test

510
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,320
they're worrying

511
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
because they should not be that high and

512
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,600
it would be good if we could bring them

513
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,880
down below the limit line

514
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,200
but the only one in here that actually

515
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
exceeds the limit line on a quasipeak

516
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,760
analysis

517
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,799
is this 250 megahertz peak and

518
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,080
that's the one that we really need to

519
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,360
focus on um

520
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,160
and i guess i jumped the gun describing

521
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,200
all of that

522
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,000
because the next slide was or did you

523
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,880
actually fail

524
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,400
and the answer was on a lot of those

525
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,480
peaks no this is an example

526
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,840
from that same uh 30 megahertz to to one

527
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,200
gigahertz spectrum

528
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,640
where the product has at least one

529
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,160
actually in this case there's only one

530
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
limit line violation at that 250

531
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,679
megahertz it's still a problem

532
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,760
there's only one limit line violation

533
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,799
but under

534
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,120
a quasipeak analysis quasimax analysis

535
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,160
that particular frequency isn't actually

536
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,640
failing um so it could be that you've

537
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,400
got a bunch of these debug frequencies

538
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,919
that are a problem but

539
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,240
it didn't matter because on on all of

540
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,480
the frequencies

541
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,440
that were formally analyzed you don't

542
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,039
actually emit enough power enough of the

543
00:18:59,039 --> 00:18:59,840
time

544
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,840
to fail um and this brings up actually a

545
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,960
critical aspect of

546
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,200
testing which is that your device

547
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,799
operates in different modes at different

548
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,440
times

549
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,400
and in order to have an accurate test

550
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,640
you do need to run the device under all

551
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
conditions for the test that it might

552
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,240
possibly encounter in the real world

553
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,960
so in particular for this device it's a

554
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,679
poe

555
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,919
powered device that can also be powered

556
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,039
by dc

557
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,640
so there's one power condition um

558
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,880
that may or may not be true and then

559
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,400
because it's ethernet

560
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,280
it also involves a wireless backhaul so

561
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,440
you can choose wired ethernet or

562
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,000
wireless which means there are four

563
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,799
total

564
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,720
sort of test conditions and it turns out

565
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,840
that this device

566
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,880
performed just fine under wireless

567
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,919
conditions because

568
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,440
you know there may or may not have even

569
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,000
been an ethernet cord plugged in and

570
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,880
as i'll describe later or right now i

571
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,600
guess

572
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,640
um this device basically only fails its

573
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,679
emissions testing

574
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,840
under connected to ethernet conditions

575
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,480
um

576
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,720
so yeah you you have to be very careful

577
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,679
about

578
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,880
whether your test scheme actually

579
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
exposes all of the

580
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,720
uh potential failure modes in rf testing

581
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,880
and also make sure that your firmware

582
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,159
isn't doing something stupid that it

583
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,679
doesn't actually need to

584
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,720
to violate those um which speaking of

585
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
contrived stupid firmwares

586
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,480
that's what we'll see later on the tiny

587
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
fpga where okay this device

588
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,480
you know is super simple how could it

589
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,840
possibly fail emissions testing like

590
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,559
what's going on

591
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,080
well if you do something super dumb in

592
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,480
firmware um or if you

593
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,919
you know there are mistakes that you can

594
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,760
make that you can potentially rectify in

595
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,559
firmware

596
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,000
that will cause an emissions test

597
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,679
failure because

598
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,200
you just didn't need to be generating as

599
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,480
much noise and you didn't realize you

600
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,200
were because

601
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,720
you know this is sort of a foreign world

602
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,320
to most designers

603
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,640
um and that was the point here

604
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,840
so not in this mode anyway um this is

605
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,520
yet another test mode of that same

606
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,640
device where

607
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,159
there are clearly a bunch of debug

608
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,799
frequencies um

609
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,880
and clearly a peak that at least in the

610
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
vertical antenna orientation

611
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,280
uh doesn't you know violates the limit

612
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,000
line

613
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,120
but in that quasi-max analysis mode that

614
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,799
actually matters for passing or failing

615
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,120
a test you like this product actually

616
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,320
passes

617
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,240
um so then the real question is once we

618
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,600
get this test report back and we know

619
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,159
okay

620
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,400
we're actually failing at 250 megahertz

621
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,159
or we're actually failing at 900

622
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,240
megahertz or like whatever it is

623
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,520
what do we do to figure out

624
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,440
how to fix that um

625
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,480
one you can just fiddle with firmware so

626
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,039
you know

627
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,960
let's say you have a i don't know uh uh

628
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,280
an oscillator like you got an led that

629
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,520
blinks at 12 megahertz or

630
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,120
i guess 12 megahertz wouldn't matter an

631
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,799
led that blinks at 50 megahertz or

632
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,520
something

633
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,480
which it turns out we do we'll get there

634
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,440
um

635
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
why do you need to be doing that just

636
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,480
turn that off in firmware and

637
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,200
boom suddenly you're passing obviously

638
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,799
people don't go out of their way to do

639
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,559
stupid things in firmware so this is

640
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,760
not really a great place to start your

641
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,960
exercise

642
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,120
um and more to the point you still have

643
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
to have a point of a b comparison

644
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,679
test cells you know plenty of testing

645
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,600
houses will let you come in and do

646
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,919
live debugging and measure your product

647
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:26,720
while you're making

648
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,400
physical changes and firmware changes

649
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,159
and all the rest of it but it's super

650
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,200
expensive like

651
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,919
time in a test cell is not cheap you

652
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,320
know

653
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,000
metal walls cost money um so

654
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,640
it's best to figure out what you can

655
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,000
what you can figure out about how your

656
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,520
device works and what might be causing

657
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,080
the problem

658
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,559
on a bench you know before you get to

659
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,080
that point

660
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,039
um if you know what you're doing in

661
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,799
terms of layout then you can take a look

662
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,440
at the

663
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,600
actual layout that you committed to bcb

664
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,840
and see like maybe i've got a bunch of

665
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,919
stubs that radiate maybe i've got a

666
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,919
bunch of like little net antennas maybe

667
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:02,720
i've got

668
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,039
you know weird devices attached or or

669
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,400
like ground plane spit

670
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,880
splits under differential traces or or

671
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,520
any

672
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,960
number of things like that that can

673
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,039
cause you know signal integrity issues

674
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:13,840
or whatever

675
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,720
those can also cause um rf emissions

676
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,440
issues

677
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,600
um and i won't really dive into that

678
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,480
because

679
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,080
i don't want to dive in uh deep

680
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,480
on customer hardware that i actually

681
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,240
have test data for

682
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,400
but you can imagine things that cause

683
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,159
signal integrity problems normally

684
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,039
um like split ground planes where return

685
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,000
current on a high

686
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,240
speed trace has to then go around in a

687
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,360
big loop

688
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,960
around your ground plane split and take

689
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,480
a different path to the pin

690
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,760
um than the the data trace itself

691
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,600
all of those sort of situations can also

692
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,279
cause rf emissions

693
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,799
so like they can be somewhat easy to

694
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,640
spot and in this particular case this

695
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,600
product

696
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,159
went through a revision where the layout

697
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,120
of

698
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,559
a land chip on board

699
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,960
got really bad and there are a bunch of

700
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,320
obvious ways in which the layout is

701
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,520
deficient and a bunch of

702
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
obvious fixes that do in fact

703
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,840
drastically change this rf emissions

704
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,000
playing field um but you don't

705
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,440
necessarily know that and more to the

706
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,400
point

707
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
if you knew exactly what you were doing

708
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,919
with layout and could spot those kind of

709
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,000
errors ahead of time

710
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,640
like we probably wouldn't be here um so

711
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,039
it's

712
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,520
good to give it a once-over but you

713
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,640
probably don't know what you're looking

714
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,919
for and if you do you probably don't

715
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,919
have that problem anyway

716
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,170
um so then really the the

717
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,720
[Music]

718
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,240
sort of first line of defense which is

719
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,919
what this workshop is all about is near

720
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,960
field probing

721
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,200
um which is effectively waving a magic

722
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,559
wand around your product and trying to

723
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,200
figure out

724
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,480
where noise is coming from um

725
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,159
and like okay what does near field

726
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,400
actually mean well rf emissions

727
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,000
compliance testing is a far-field uh

728
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,039
far-field test like an antenna measures

729
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,840
our uh rf emissions in the far field

730
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,960
which

731
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,120
again this is operating at the limit of

732
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,279
my rf experience but

733
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,440
effectively boils down to are you inside

734
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,120
of one wavelength or outside of one

735
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,159
wavelength

736
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,039
and another way to look at this is what

737
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,000
impedance

738
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,240
is the signal in question actually

739
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,000
impacted by is it the impedance of free

740
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,760
space as it floats through the air

741
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,960
or is it impedances as measured close to

742
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,640
your board like the impedance of copper

743
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,320
in a trace or the

744
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,880
impedance of the trace to your ground

745
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,279
plane or those sorts of impedances

746
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,960
um and the real key point here is that

747
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,720
in that super near field especially like

748
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,320
the closer you get the more

749
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,200
the magnetic field dominates um which

750
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,000
we'll see when we

751
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,640
sort of choose which probes to go for um

752
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,559
so effectively you you hunt around on

753
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,840
your board for probes that sense

754
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,880
magnetic fields

755
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,000
and wherever there's loud high intensity

756
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,039
magnetic field

757
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,320
that's probably where you need to be

758
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,400
looking as far as what's causing the

759
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,840
emissions problems and what you might be

760
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,120
able to change in firmware or what you

761
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,480
might be able to change in layout to do

762
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,919
something about this

763
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,080
um even in as far as near field probing

764
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,200
is concerned there are sort of two

765
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,000
techniques to do

766
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,440
it um one of which is

767
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,360
i i'll call it the magic wand method

768
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,960
where you

769
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,480
grab a bunch of probes that look like

770
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,080
this and there are tons of videos online

771
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,120
this technique is not

772
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,320
very tricky as we'll see um it really is

773
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,640
kind of just as simple as it sounds um

774
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,360
and it's

775
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,039
just setting it up and having experience

776
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,720
and doing with it that that gives you

777
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,240
the valuable you know experience um

778
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
one of the two methods is basically just

779
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,840
waving a magic wand around your board

780
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,679
that senses those magnetic fields and

781
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,200
seeing where the magnetic fields get

782
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,080
loud

783
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,640
um which basically means get a spectrum

784
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,919
analyzer

785
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,320
get some near field probes and wave them

786
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,520
around your board to try to figure out

787
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,400
what's going wrong

788
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,000
and like that's exactly what we'll be

789
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
doing um

790
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,559
another method if you really want to

791
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,760
spend lots of money

792
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,799
um and it does have serious pros

793
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,480
is buy a device that waves

794
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,039
thousands of magic wands around for you

795
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,400
and in particular doesn't actually wave

796
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,919
them but keeps them in exactly the same

797
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,120
spot

798
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,919
so this device called em scanner from

799
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,760
yic technologies

800
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,520
uh basically is a grid i don't know how

801
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,200
large it is but it's a bunch of antenna

802
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,320
elements it's like

803
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,720
i don't know 80 by 100 or something like

804
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,399
that little tiny near field probes

805
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,080
embedded in a workbench

806
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,440
and it has a spectrum analyzer attached

807
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,000
to it you know a usb spectrum analyzer

808
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,760
that rapidly switches between all of

809
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,600
those different um

810
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
all of those different antennas the idea

811
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
here is you can

812
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,279
you can run a scan a spatial scan over

813
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,640
your entire board

814
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
and make a little change in firmware or

815
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,480
snap a ferret on a power lead or

816
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,240
something like that and then test again

817
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,799
and get a direct a b comparison this is

818
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,240
really valuable

819
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
but it is the expensive way to go about

820
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,520
doing things and

821
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,200
uh i think it's super interesting i've

822
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,559
never actually tried it myself

823
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,200
and don't have the money to but if you

824
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,720
want to learn more about it

825
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,440
the link up at the top of the slide if

826
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,200
i've done it correctly should be to a

827
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,520
webinar i saw recently it's basically

828
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,200
advertising material for this device in

829
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,799
this company but aren't they all

830
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,640
super interesting to see exactly how it

831
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,399
works and and what kind of av

832
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,919
comparisons you can make with a device

833
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:22,880
like this

834
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,640
um it turns out the predecessor to this

835
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,919
kind of a device for doing

836
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,840
really rigorous a b comparisons is

837
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
effectively a robotic arm that just

838
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
waves your near field probe over your

839
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,039
product the same way we'll be doing

840
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,120
manually

841
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,039
um so at this point

842
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,480
uh i guess i would love to kind of check

843
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,679
in with everyone

844
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,440
how everyone's doing on software um

845
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,760
i'm kind of through all of the uh

846
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,120
talking theory whatever stuff that you

847
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,080
may or may not have just ignored um and

848
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,480
if everyone's still really far behind

849
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,720
like catching up setting up software and

850
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,679
everything

851
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,399
maybe i should take a quick slow down

852
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,520
here maybe not

853
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,440
i don't know i can't see the chat for

854
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,039
whatever reason you guys have a

855
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,720
read on how that's looking

856
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,799
fine all right i suppose i'll carry on

857
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,000
um

858
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,159
effectively the the quick demo here is

859
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,000
if you have tons of money how do you do

860
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,080
this sort of near field probing quote

861
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,600
unquote the right way

862
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,320
so basically i've got here on my bench

863
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,600
we rented for

864
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,880
this rf debugging process a

865
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,360
tech rsa 507a which is a real-time

866
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,480
spectrum analyzer

867
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,600
oh i guess i should cover that too um

868
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,679
and then these rhodium schwarz

869
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,000
hz15 probe set um as far as the rsa so i

870
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,399
i

871
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,919
told you guys about swept spectrum

872
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,840
analysis where you look at one point and

873
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,360
then move to the next in frequency and

874
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,080
then move to the next

875
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,919
frequency and do that in a sweep um we

876
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,440
can demo that with sdrs a little bit

877
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,919
later

878
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,640
but uh the alternative to that that's

879
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,159
basically only possible with modern

880
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,320
instruments and tools is real-time

881
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,080
spectrum analysis where effectively you

882
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,440
take a

883
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,399
time series sample of a chunk of

884
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,600
spectrum

885
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,919
and then analyze it all at once do an

886
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:18,960
fft on that

887
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,279
on that time series data and that gives

888
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,559
you a

889
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,279
like you know frequency spectrogram of

890
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,080
what's going on

891
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,640
in the rf uh at that moment in time in

892
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,840
that whole bandwidth

893
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,520
so sdrs do exactly this um rather than

894
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,080
like sweep one frequency through the rtl

895
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,679
sdr we'll be using takes a

896
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,559
like what 2.4 megahertz wide chunk of

897
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,840
spectrum

898
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,559
um all at once you know centered around

899
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,919
your tuning frequency

900
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,919
and reflects that all at once which is

901
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,600
super great for

902
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,200
zeroing in on a frequency that you

903
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,640
already know is a

904
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,799
as a potential problem because you just

905
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,559
tuned to that frequency and then you can

906
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,960
see in real time as you move the probe

907
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,480
around exactly what that frequency is

908
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,120
doing

909
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,559
along with potentially frequencies

910
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,159
adjacent to it um

911
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,760
it's a little bit of a mixed bag but the

912
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,080
cool thing about the rsa507a like a

913
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
serious real-time spectrum analyzer

914
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,240
that you spent good money for is it does

915
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,039
all of that really fast and will also do

916
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,039
like quasi swept stuff where it takes a

917
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,720
chunk of spectrum a chunk of spectrum a

918
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,000
chunk of spectrum

919
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,720
and shows you like what happened during

920
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,840
that sweep

921
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,399
with like subsets of real-time spectrum

922
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,760
um

923
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,399
we'll see that in the demo now uh and we

924
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,640
can also approximate that with our sdrs

925
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,559
later which i will get to as well and

926
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,840
which is why we're using cube spectrum

927
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,640
analyzer

928
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,600
so let me switch oh i guess i guess i

929
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,360
should cover these probes too

930
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,519
um the two types of near-field probe

931
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,559
that exist are

932
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,720
h-field and e field probes one of which

933
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,320
senses the electro

934
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,000
uh the electric field

935
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,640
um in a piece of space in a volume of

936
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,000
space and one of which senses the

937
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,760
magnetic field in a volume of space

938
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
this is exactly the same way that a

939
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,360
voltmeter senses voltage

940
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,240
and a current clamp senses current by

941
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,880
virtue of

942
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,919
magnetic field um we've literally got

943
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,399
a current clamp that uses air as the

944
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:10,960
core

945
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,440
in the form uh or for all of these

946
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,480
h-field probes

947
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,159
and we've got a a

948
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,440
i don't want to say electric static but

949
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,279
basically a volt meter operating in air

950
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,080
which is

951
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,600
you know a little tiny antenna on the

952
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,360
end of each of these e-field probes

953
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,720
and the only difference between the

954
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,120
probes is the spatial resolution so

955
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,600
the small e-field probe and the small

956
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,960
h-field probe

957
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,080
sense uh a much smaller

958
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,760
area much smaller volume of space with

959
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,320
much lower sensitivity so a probe you

960
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,240
know this large probe

961
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,360
will react very sensitively because it's

962
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,039
capturing a lot of magnetic field

963
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,720
but you won't really know where that

964
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,399
field is coming from with quite the same

965
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,159
spatial resolution as a tiny one

966
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,919
and the real point of this is with the

967
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,440
sdr and and low noise amplifier

968
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
the sensitivity problem isn't actually a

969
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,960
huge concern we can

970
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,919
amplify the the signal up until we can

971
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:06,640
see it

972
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,320
even though the sensitivity of the probe

973
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,080
itself is very very tiny

974
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,159
um so the beauty of that is we wind a

975
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,279
really tiny coil

976
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,120
and then we get to see

977
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,480
exactly what's happening on for instance

978
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
an individual trace so

979
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,600
i am going to find where zoom went

980
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
i legitimately don't oh stop chair there

981
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,960
we go that's the problem

982
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,760
um and let me share my

983
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,039
share my virtual machine

984
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,640
um y'all should be able to see a

985
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,760
silent spectrum of this tech rsa

986
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,600
let's see if it will actually run

987
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,279
you don't appear to be running is it

988
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,200
still connected oh goodness it might not

989
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,080
be connected

990
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,440
um sorry all of my youtube uh

991
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,880
youtube all of my bluetooth devices

992
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,559
disconnected

993
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,600
when i moved to my laptop um all right

994
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,720
so i'm connecting

995
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,280
i just passed through the usb device uh

996
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,239
to this virtual machine there we go okay

997
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,839
so

998
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,040
what we're looking at here um is

999
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,399
i've got the the uh

1000
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,239
low noise amplifier hooked up to the

1001
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,560
input of this actual tech rsa

1002
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,239
and i've got the you know near field

1003
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,320
probes plugged in on the other end

1004
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,879
um the reason i recommended this

1005
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,639
particular lna is that you can power it

1006
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,440
via usb

1007
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,000
or bias t or external dc inputs it's

1008
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,879
easy enough to move

1009
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,679
for this for this situation and what

1010
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,320
we'll do

1011
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,000
is i am going to attach this

1012
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,760
bigger b field probe uh h-pro i guess

1013
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,440
um and we'll take a look

1014
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,599
quick at this alka-tree board that i've

1015
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,040
got just because it's interesting

1016
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,800
so you'll notice that we're scanning

1017
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,640
from zero megahertz to 100 megahertz

1018
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,760
it's a little bit confusing that this

1019
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,200
isn't a logarithmic plot

1020
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,400
um it's linear but 0 to 100 megahertz

1021
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,680
because i figure that's probably where

1022
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,760
we'll see something along the lines of

1023
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,880
clock signals or oscillators

1024
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,560
or anything like that you know we'll

1025
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,079
generate higher frequencies inside the

1026
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,119
fpga but

1027
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,560
board level stuff that's probably where

1028
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,960
we'll see so if i start

1029
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,800
just waving my magic wand over this

1030
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,240
entire board

1031
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,079
well we see a lot of stuff going on we

1032
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,320
see a lot of really broadband noise

1033
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,920
if i get super close to this switching

1034
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,520
converter which like

1035
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,599
i guess probably shouldn't be too

1036
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,640
surprising right

1037
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,000
like switching converters make

1038
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,119
a lot of a lot of magnetic field noise

1039
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,359
um and that's what we're picking up and

1040
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,400
this is one of the

1041
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,560
key areas where the difference between

1042
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,800
near field and far field is important

1043
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,400
the fact that we're detecting all of

1044
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,720
this noise doesn't necessarily

1045
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,880
imply that this noise exists in the

1046
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
far-field electric field

1047
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,520
um so like this might be cause for

1048
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,800
concern but it's not

1049
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,880
actually because we know that you know

1050
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,240
it passed the test report

1051
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,720
actually for this device we don't but i

1052
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,760
assume it did

1053
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,440
um i mean it probably didn't i don't

1054
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,599
know anyway we don't necessarily have to

1055
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,400
worry about it

1056
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,359
what's more interesting is is there any

1057
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:15,760
like

1058
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,680
individual shark peak that we can pick

1059
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,200
up and it looks like on this side of the

1060
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,599
board

1061
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,760
i'm not seeing anything that's super

1062
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,720
obviously

1063
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
like a clock or an oscillator i kind of

1064
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,000
figured that this device down here

1065
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,480
might be an oscillator for the fpga but

1066
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,599
i'm not so sure

1067
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,040
if we flip the board over and search

1068
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,800
around

1069
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,200
it's pretty quiet up on this end oh but

1070
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,480
there's something

1071
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,599
that's certainly a little bit

1072
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,200
interesting we're starting to get a nice

1073
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,800
bright peak is that 60

1074
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,839
yeah 60 megahertz we're getting a whole

1075
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:44,880
lot

1076
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,359
of 60 megahertz right around this area

1077
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,359
so like let's go look at what that might

1078
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,079
be

1079
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,920
then if we come down here we start to

1080
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,320
see a couple of other individual peaks

1081
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,760
i see them now because i saw them

1082
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,599
earlier but but

1083
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,119
they are a little bit buried in the rest

1084
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,800
of the switching noise so okay we've got

1085
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,560
some 60 megahertz somewhere over here to

1086
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,520
look into

1087
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,599
we've got a little bit of peakiness down

1088
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,079
here that looks like what

1089
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:10,240
35 36 megahertz something like that

1090
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,839
so let's go in for a slightly closer

1091
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,920
look i'm going to switch from the

1092
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,599
like large b field probe that i have

1093
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,200
been using to

1094
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,920
a slightly smaller probe that gives a

1095
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,560
little bit

1096
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,320
better spatial resolution and

1097
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,560
we see again okay i mean the peak is

1098
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,079
lower because we're using a less

1099
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,599
sensitive probe but we definitely see

1100
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,119
that same 60 megahertz p

1101
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,800
we don't see a lot of that broadband

1102
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,320
noise which is

1103
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,720
is interesting um and then we see

1104
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,160
i'm just gonna give it away it's a 12

1105
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,240
megahertz and a 36 megahertz peak down

1106
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,000
here if we get close to this

1107
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,160
thing that looks suspiciously like an

1108
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,359
oscillator

1109
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,480
so just for giggles i'm gonna throw this

1110
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,599
all

1111
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,040
under the microscope and have a look at

1112
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,720
what we're actually looking at

1113
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,240
and especially like if you're debugging

1114
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,760
your own design it should immediately be

1115
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,119
apparent what you're looking at because

1116
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,880
you'll know but

1117
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,000
lo and behold this is an ftdi

1118
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,920
ft-232 uh h you know serial converter

1119
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,480
chip

1120
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,599
if we look up here in this corner that

1121
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,720
thing that looks like an oscillator is

1122
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,480
indeed a 12 megahertz oscillator

1123
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,400
so sure looks like we're picking up 12

1124
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
megahertz and a couple of harmonics of

1125
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,560
it

1126
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,800
and okay what's going on over here

1127
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,240
that's a little odd

1128
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,800
um let's dig in on that a little bit

1129
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,280
before we get too much farther

1130
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,839
uh i'm going to switch to this tiny tiny

1131
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,440
little hpl probe and if this looks

1132
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,720
similar for those of you who followed

1133
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,839
along at home to begin with

1134
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,960
with the with the really small diy probe

1135
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,920
you might have already made

1136
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,320
the whole point of this probe is that

1137
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,480
it's the same loop antenna the same

1138
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
magnetic loop antenna

1139
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,480
but in a tiny tiny little uh little

1140
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,680
package up at that tip

1141
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,599
so we should be able to see um if we

1142
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,520
wander around with the loop parallel to

1143
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,960
the board we can see okay the 60

1144
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,800
megahertz seems to be over here

1145
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,960
and it's not actually over here anywhere

1146
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,240
out in the free space

1147
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,880
it's not it's not as bright down here by

1148
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,680
the oscillator

1149
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,040
if we get really close to the oscillator

1150
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,720
we can see that 12 megahertz and

1151
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,359
36 megahertz really pick up but if we

1152
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,960
get over here

1153
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,960
oh something's going on right around

1154
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,200
here that that 60 megahertz is really

1155
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,000
picking up

1156
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,680
so now the question is okay let's look

1157
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,599
at what trace that might be on if we

1158
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,160
move the

1159
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,160
probe um orthogonal to the trace

1160
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,320
so like we're literally we're basically

1161
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,480
putting half of the current transformer

1162
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,599
uh like next to the uh

1163
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,200
individual trace we're trying to measure

1164
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,960
we can basically with this probe

1165
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,280
pick out nearly which pin specifically

1166
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,880
is actually emitting all this noise

1167
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
and interestingly we can see some new

1168
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,400
and interesting noise on other pins

1169
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,599
individual pins

1170
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,560
but that's what's going on over here so

1171
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,160
at this point we have

1172
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,200
a halfway decent idea of

1173
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,760
what noise sources exist on our board

1174
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,160
and what's going on

1175
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,480
and you know let's just assume that you

1176
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,320
were looking in this range because you

1177
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,079
had a 60 megahertz failure in your test

1178
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,280
report or something like that

1179
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,920
although you can just hunt arbitrary

1180
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,200
signals this way

1181
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,319
it's just if you don't know that they're

1182
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,920
failing yet then it might not be worth

1183
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,400
your eye

1184
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,680
your effort to try to correct them um

1185
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,599
but sure enough we've got those loud

1186
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,119
signals let's see what they might be

1187
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,720
if we look over on the data sheet for

1188
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,000
the ft-232h

1189
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,240
guess this would be easier i am just

1190
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
going to

1191
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,520
open this in a tab well it might be

1192
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,480
easier unless my

1193
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,920
virtual machine completely chokes and

1194
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,839
dies on it uh

1195
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,760
huh

1196
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,200
oh no

1197
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,240
i guess i don't actually have i'm just

1198
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,560
trying to rejoin this

1199
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,000
this chat um

1200
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,160
there we go didn't didn't copy it the

1201
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,920
first time

1202
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,319
um if we look at the data sheet for this

1203
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,680
multiple choices

1204
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,440
what oh my goodness

1205
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,119
oh my goodness okay well anyway

1206
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,480
long story short if we look at the data

1207
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,160
sheet for the fc232h we see

1208
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,920
one it does indeed use a 12 megahertz

1209
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,160
oscillator so that thing that had 12 on

1210
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,599
it and looked like an oscillator was a

1211
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,880
12 megahertz oscillator

1212
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,200
surprised um it also has a couple of

1213
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,480
interesting features where

1214
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,240
it pipes clocks out on a couple of

1215
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,000
different pins so

1216
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,599
it has a couple of different clocks

1217
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,440
that'll it'll pump out i don't recall

1218
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,119
exactly what they are but one of them is

1219
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,200
a 60 megahertz system clock that

1220
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,640
all of the other devices in your system

1221
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,920
are supposed to be synchronized too if

1222
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,560
you've got

1223
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,640
i guess multiple devices operating on

1224
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,680
that same

1225
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,480
oh sorry i didn't mean to bring up the

1226
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,119
news

1227
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,400
um if you've got multiple devices

1228
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
operating on that same like

1229
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,920
circuit and you need to time synchronize

1230
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,480
them it blasts a 60 megahertz clock out

1231
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,079
on one of those pins so

1232
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,839
that's probably what we're what we're

1233
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,359
spotting there and

1234
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,640
now you just go look at the pin out for

1235
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,839
the device and see uh okay

1236
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,240
is that what i'm seeing is that signal

1237
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,680
that i know exists in another part of

1238
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,079
the chip

1239
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,079
coupling on to that signal that i was

1240
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,920
measuring erroneously or

1241
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,280
what's going on here um

1242
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,400
let's see and another

1243
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,040
another interesting feature of this i

1244
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,640
don't know that i can

1245
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,280
demo it because i don't think it seems

1246
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,560
like it's going to be a lot of work to

1247
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,079
try to set up a

1248
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,359
computer audio pass through but

1249
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,079
one thing that this tool does offer

1250
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,359
that's kind of nice

1251
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,040
is if we go to displays and do

1252
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,680
[Music]

1253
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,040
amplitude versus time maybe

1254
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,520
doing this live is probably a poor

1255
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,800
choice i think this is

1256
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,800
i think this is correct um

1257
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,040
why are you not even running acquisition

1258
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,800
bandwidth too small for current setup oh

1259
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,200
um

1260
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,280
i want a measurement so this is this is

1261
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,400
one of those aspects

1262
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,680
this rsa has a real-time bandwidth of

1263
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,880
about 40 megahertz

1264
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,800
um which means if i'm looking at this

1265
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,000
spectrum view

1266
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,520
it looks like it's one continuous

1267
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,720
spectrum that it's capturing over and

1268
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,160
over again but what it's actually doing

1269
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,839
is capturing the first chunk then

1270
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:18,880
quickly

1271
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,480
changing tuning frequency capturing the

1272
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,640
second chunk and so on for the

1273
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,720
for the width of my bandwidth some

1274
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,079
devices require

1275
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,119
some some software tools in this suite

1276
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,520
require that you aren't exceeding the

1277
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,880
real-time bandwidth that requires

1278
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,119
like it can't it can't sweep and sort of

1279
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:35,920
dither

1280
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,760
sections of frequency spectrum that are

1281
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,359
coming in so

1282
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,680
this tool is one of them this amplitude

1283
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,560
versus time

1284
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,160
uh has a convenient tool

1285
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,440
i don't even remember where it is

1286
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,040
um but you can effectively turn on

1287
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,079
uh turn on like a squealy signal output

1288
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,599
i'm sure i've just got the wrong tool

1289
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,280
where

1290
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,240
as you are over a particular frequency

1291
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,200
of interest

1292
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,640
and you see the spike it'll basically

1293
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,160
make a whistle that gets higher in

1294
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,839
frequency with higher amplitude of that

1295
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:10,880
section of spectrum

1296
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,560
and lower so that instead of having to

1297
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,160
stare at a screen while you move your

1298
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,000
probe physically around you can

1299
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,920
listen audibly for where the signal

1300
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,040
happens to be loudest

1301
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,560
literally um i don't want to dwell too

1302
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,480
much time on that

1303
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,240
um one thing i do want to demo

1304
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:36,319
is um if i

1305
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,599
tools presets setup displays

1306
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,280
i want a spectrogram view

1307
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,440
so in particular

1308
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,359
oh do i want a spectrogram view goodness

1309
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,400
me

1310
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,880
i want

1311
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,560
dpx that's what i want remove you add

1312
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,119
dpx

1313
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,040
okay so dpx is tektronix version of

1314
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,599
like digital phosphor and the idea here

1315
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:08,319
is that

1316
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,319
the color corresponds to the uh

1317
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,160
effectively average amount of power at

1318
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
that frequency so clearly

1319
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,200
we've got some peaks up here and that's

1320
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:19,520
the

1321
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,560
that's the peak line that we're

1322
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,040
detecting if we look down uh

1323
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,440
in traces we can see trace one is the

1324
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,640
positive peak

1325
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,040
so that yellow trace is the absolute

1326
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,720
maximum power that it detected in that

1327
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,040
period of time this

1328
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,599
basically colors the average power so we

1329
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,480
see that the

1330
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,160
average noise floor is actually a little

1331
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,599
bit lower than the

1332
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,520
than the peak noise floor which makes a

1333
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,880
lot of sense

1334
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,240
um if we

1335
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,440
i want frequency 50 span 100

1336
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,520
and actually you can see it here where

1337
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,040
it appears to fill in this part first

1338
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,400
then this part then this part then this

1339
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,079
part then this fourth and this part

1340
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,760
because it's trying to capture all that

1341
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,280
statistical data so it takes a ton of

1342
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:01,920
captures

1343
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,000
at a particular tuning range and then

1344
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,200
moves on to the next one and then moves

1345
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,720
on to the next one we can really see the

1346
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,000
sort of sweep action that it's doing and

1347
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,359
we'll be able to see this later in scr

1348
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,160
as well

1349
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,480
but this gives us a much more

1350
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,880
interesting idea of

1351
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,240
if i go over here and measure

1352
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,359
let's say that 60 megahertz thing

1353
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,880
that gives us a real interesting idea of

1354
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,480
what's actually happening on that signal

1355
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,359
where

1356
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,880
okay the peak that we were measuring

1357
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,880
earlier is

1358
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,240
very indicative of how much rf power is

1359
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,280
actually going

1360
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,079
on there and you can see why this gives

1361
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,839
you a really good visual of

1362
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,240
what's going on if you are operating in

1363
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,520
a frequency range where you can tune to

1364
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,040
it and

1365
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,520
we'll see later while the uh while the

1366
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,440
other tools don't necessarily scan

1367
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,040
the frequency to give you a wider than

1368
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,720
real-time bandwidth like this

1369
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,760
um at least sdr angel does give you this

1370
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,119
sort of digital foster review that can

1371
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,880
be super useful if you're looking at

1372
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,119
a range that's relatively more

1373
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,319
constrained

1374
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,240
uh let me figure out where i am in the

1375
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,480
slides

1376
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,839
um okay so at this point

1377
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,640
i want to

1378
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,960
stop burning a bunch of bandwidth on

1379
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,400
that

1380
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,440
um let me

1381
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,359
close that vm and go back to

1382
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,480
sharing the slides

1383
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,640
yes that'll do okay

1384
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,920
so i should be back to the slides

1385
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,839
um so at this point i want to like

1386
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,000
actually quickly build a probe

1387
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,800
and and show you that process so like

1388
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,000
this will be a little bit of a catch up

1389
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,599
before i dive in with the sdr side of

1390
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,040
things and show you how

1391
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,240
that compares versus the uh

1392
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,920
versus the expensive rsa gear

1393
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,200
so i showed you before

1394
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,119
this probe which is like basically my

1395
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,119
favorite of all of them

1396
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,400
um this probe is literally the same as

1397
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,040
this guy

1398
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,440
it's just a loop of wire um tucked up

1399
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,599
neatly and tightly into the

1400
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,160
tiny little tip of that of that plastic

1401
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,040
housing

1402
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,720
so if this this might be impossible to

1403
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,880
see and i preemptively apologize it is

1404
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,559
uh if this is roughly equivalent

1405
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,800
to this guy uh albeit without any

1406
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,920
shielding

1407
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,280
then these two are roughly equivalent

1408
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,040
and really all we need to do is make a

1409
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,119
loop of wire as small as we can possibly

1410
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,240
get

1411
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,839
and there are a couple of key

1412
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,359
differences that i've

1413
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,200
found in practice don't appear to

1414
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,280
actually hear all that much

1415
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,119
one key difference is it's really

1416
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,280
important where the active area of the

1417
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:45,920
probe is

1418
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,640
and the definition of active uh is where

1419
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,000
their reason isn't shielding

1420
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,280
at least nominally so like this probe

1421
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,880
is designed in such a way that there's a

1422
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,319
magnetic loop up here and this is

1423
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,440
sensitive to

1424
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,000
to magnetic field through the probe like

1425
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,200
through that open loop

1426
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,359
but not at all incident electric field

1427
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,800
because like

1428
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,920
you're trying to measure just the

1429
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,839
magnetic field you don't want this

1430
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,559
whole thing acting like a an electrical

1431
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:11,280
antenna

1432
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,280
and receiving electric field as well so

1433
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,640
this probe is designed in such a way

1434
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,440
that there's

1435
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,280
uh there's a shielding a conductive

1436
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,520
shielding over the entire thing

1437
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,160
though split so that there's still a

1438
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:22,880
current loop

1439
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,000
for uh magnetic field to induce a

1440
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,559
current

1441
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,000
and therefore voltage um

1442
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,599
it turns out i think that's actually not

1443
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,119
altogether that important and at least

1444
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,559
it's not important to

1445
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,319
enough to spend that money on these

1446
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,079
probes if you don't desperately need

1447
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:38,720
them

1448
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,920
um i think what's going on here is that

1449
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,960
this probe

1450
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,200
which is just the simple loop of wire

1451
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,480
the way it's designed is

1452
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,800
we've got an actual open loop of wire up

1453
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,920
here at the top you can see it's

1454
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,319
actually

1455
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,319
technically two loops i'll just open it

1456
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,599
up like that

1457
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,040
we've got an open loop of wire up here

1458
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,839
at the top that magnetic field can

1459
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:58,079
penetrate

1460
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,800
if we look down here the probe

1461
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,640
theoretically should be insensitive to

1462
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,400
any magnetic field in this region

1463
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,599
because one the loop area and the

1464
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,000
induced voltages is proportional to loop

1465
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,640
area

1466
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,720
the loop area is really tiny on any of

1467
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,559
these individual little twists

1468
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,960
um and also they they alternate

1469
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,160
direction each time

1470
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,520
so it's effectively if you wound a

1471
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,839
transformer one way for one turn and

1472
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:22,960
then the other way for the next turn and

1473
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,079
then the other way for the next turn and

1474
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,280
then the other and so on

1475
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,400
so that basically every turn just

1476
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,079
canceled itself out and the net output

1477
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,359
of the transformer zero that's

1478
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,800
effectively what we've done here by

1479
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,480
twisting this pair is both minimize the

1480
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,680
loop area that's open

1481
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,200
to magnetic field and also

1482
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,800
make sure that any magnetic field

1483
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,400
affecting this open loop

1484
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,319
is immediately canceled by the adjacent

1485
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,079
open loop um

1486
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,599
and then the second half of this is i

1487
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:48,800
think these pretty much just don't

1488
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,960
really require shielding to be useful

1489
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,440
simply because they're like electrical

1490
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,880
short circuits of dc

1491
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,800
so you know this will have like terrible

1492
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,160
rejection in an rf sense but also

1493
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,559
terrible sensitivity to electric fields

1494
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,800
so we're basically just relying on the

1495
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,960
terrible sensitivity to e fields

1496
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,839
of a probe that that just has a short

1497
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,760
circuit to ground effectively

1498
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,200
um and measuring primarily magnetic

1499
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,880
field instead

1500
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,160
so the way i made this probe

1501
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,880
um obviously it's magnet wire capped on

1502
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,359
tape

1503
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:28,720
and an sma connector just

1504
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,839
taped onto a regular garden variety

1505
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,200
wooden skewer

1506
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,359
um i've got my magnet wire here

1507
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:41,598
uh what i did was

1508
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,000
i hope i have this pin here still oh

1509
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,760
i originally won this on a pen but we'll

1510
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,680
just grab some sewing needles out of my

1511
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,400
uh my

1512
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,520
thing instead um what i effectively did

1513
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,839
was

1514
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,720
clamp a

1515
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:05,839
needle

1516
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,839
in a vice get it nice and

1517
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,240
nice and tight um stabbed myself a

1518
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,079
couple times true story legitimately

1519
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,480
drew a fair amount of blood doing this

1520
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,559
which like is pretty predictable if

1521
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:23,760
we're honest

1522
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,880
um let's

1523
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,760
clip off

1524
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,480
a bit of wire and literally this is all

1525
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,400
there is to it

1526
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:40,079
one wrap of wire pull it nice and tight

1527
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:46,160
and start twisting

1528
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,920
and we'll see this probe is not great

1529
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,000
because there's a big open loop of wire

1530
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,599
next to the active tip

1531
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,520
try to tighten that up but really that

1532
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,319
is all there is to it

1533
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,359
and what's interesting is

1534
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,720
this basically gets you for

1535
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,160
approximately free almost all of the

1536
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,359
benefit of that expensive hd15 probe set

1537
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,480
over something like this so

1538
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,760
you know near field probes don't have to

1539
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,200
be expensive and they've been getting

1540
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:15,680
cheaper

1541
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,160
lately with the sort of hacker um

1542
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,599
hacker-focused products from

1543
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,359
like rf explorer and whatnot these

1544
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:22,800
near-field probes are great they

1545
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,599
behave and operate nearly identically to

1546
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:26,839
these probes

1547
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:29,680
like it's basically just quality of life

1548
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,040
difference between these two

1549
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,480
um the smb connector on the base of this

1550
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,240
is really nice for just chunking in and

1551
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,599
out of the cable when you switch probes

1552
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,440
frequently

1553
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,599
rf explorer gets around that problem by

1554
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,440
having this little piece of rigid coax

1555
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:43,839
and an

1556
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,800
unthreaded sma so you can just slot

1557
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,920
those into the top

1558
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,079
i find it's one a little bit fiddly and

1559
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,680
two there's not much room to grab on the

1560
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,240
probe

1561
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,640
so i bought a couple of smb connectors

1562
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,520
after the fact

1563
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,559
and uh

1564
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,640
added them i guess actually i bought

1565
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,400
these smb connectors so i could just use

1566
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,920
this cable to go back and forth

1567
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,280
between these two probe sets while i was

1568
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,200
working but but

1569
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,119
i encourage if you're making probes

1570
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,000
probably use smb connectors

1571
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,359
you know with a handle just to make

1572
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,040
things easy on yourself but

1573
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,400
you don't have to overthink it they'll

1574
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,800
still work

1575
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,839
and really the the beauty of

1576
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,680
the beauty of this probe over everything

1577
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,520
else in the rf explorer kit is simply

1578
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,160
that

1579
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,920
the smallest probe in the rf explorer

1580
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,839
kit still has a bunch of bulky shielding

1581
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:30,400
around it

1582
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,000
so you can't really dive into an

1583
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,640
individual trace

1584
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,920
um yeah so obviously i didn't do the

1585
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,680
soldering i'll try to go a little slow

1586
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,000
if

1587
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,119
anyone's trying to catch up but

1588
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,559
that's really all there is to it to

1589
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,480
build a a

1590
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,880
near field probe that is genuinely

1591
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,079
extremely useful

1592
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,400
for figuring out exactly what trace or

1593
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,319
signal or subsystem on your board is

1594
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,280
causing noise

1595
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,200
because it's not necessarily enough to

1596
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,799
simply wave your

1597
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,599
magic wand over so in that design it was

1598
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,160
the land 9512 right the land 9512 was

1599
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,079
radiating all of this 250 megahertz

1600
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,920
noise it's not enough to just wave your

1601
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,240
magic wand over the land 95 12 and say

1602
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,720
huh it's the land 95 12 making 250

1603
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,400
megahertz there's nothing in the data

1604
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,000
sheet for that part that says

1605
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,520
uh this part will radiate

1606
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,280
megahertz like a banshee off of this pin

1607
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,119
figure it out like they don't offer you

1608
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,880
that kind of guidance it turns out

1609
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,240
like the ethernet sub system on that

1610
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,400
chip operates at 250 megahertz

1611
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,599
and there are a bunch of different

1612
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,319
analog um voltage rails

1613
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,839
and and like conditioning pins where

1614
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,119
250 megahertz is coupled very strongly

1615
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:42,400
onto them so if you have

1616
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,160
like large loop areas and long traces

1617
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,079
and decoupling capacitors that are not

1618
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,160
super adjacent to the pins and that sort

1619
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,040
of thing

1620
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,160
that's what you end up with um

1621
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,920
oh and i'm actually on my last slide

1622
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,880
anyway i guess um

1623
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,240
so yeah basically the

1624
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,119
outcome here is when you've got uh a

1625
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,319
signal that you know what you're looking

1626
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,359
for you want to use

1627
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,520
something like this really tiny tiny

1628
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,520
probe to

1629
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,000
find exactly which pin it is so let's go

1630
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,880
ahead now

1631
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,920
that we have a probe taken care of and

1632
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,559
and we've got

1633
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,640
all of our rf stuff set up let's go

1634
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,400
ahead now and actually fire up the rf

1635
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,520
tool chain

1636
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,559
or sorry the sdr tool chain and see

1637
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:25,760
about doing this

1638
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,599
the cheap way um

1639
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,880
there we go for anyone wondering the

1640
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,520
dragon dragon osvm username is dragon

1641
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,799
passwords dragon

1642
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:40,000
um yeah login um

1643
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,359
okay so first things first let me get my

1644
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:44,799
sdr device and

1645
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,680
actually plug it in i got this guy um

1646
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,000
the one that i recommended all of you by

1647
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,799
uh i have to plug it in over here

1648
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,799
because usbs are at a premium

1649
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:58,160
and then i will go over here

1650
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,480
uh pull my

1651
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,760
vana off here um i'm going to be

1652
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,160
oh this is this is a kernel critical

1653
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:10,880
aspect that i

1654
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,920
didn't cover i covered this in the

1655
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,920
instructions but the way we'll be

1656
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,839
powering this particular

1657
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:19,200
um lna is via a bias t

1658
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,960
so i didn't want to like offer a

1659
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,319
shopping list with a bunch of

1660
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,160
usb power supplies even though i'm sure

1661
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,880
everyone already has one anyway um

1662
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,040
i wanted something that was easy

1663
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,040
basically a bias t works by

1664
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,079
setting a dc voltage on the

1665
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,920
uh like input to the sdr and then

1666
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,079
this device is powered by that offset

1667
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,440
voltage on the

1668
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,119
on its output side so if we plug

1669
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,319
this guy in so output to the sdr

1670
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,480
it will light up with power because the

1671
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,680
uh the

1672
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,559
bias t inside the sdr is powering it

1673
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:55,119
very

1674
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,480
critical point here is that

1675
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,720
there's a dc voltage on this pin out of

1676
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,000
the sdr right now

1677
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,839
so what we definitely don't want to do

1678
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,040
is

1679
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,760
plug in our probe without the bias t or

1680
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,880
rather without the

1681
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,359
the um lna the lna has a dc

1682
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,400
blocking capacitor on the rf input side

1683
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,880
uh rf input side so that no

1684
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,960
um no dc voltage from the power supply

1685
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,160
circuitry of this guy

1686
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,200
uh leaks out into your antenna or

1687
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,400
anything like that

1688
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,839
um which is important because

1689
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,640
these are dc shorts to ground so

1690
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,079
effectively if you plug

1691
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:41,440
this antenna directly into the um

1692
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,520
the bias t enabled sdr and you have no

1693
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,880
way to turn the biases off

1694
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,640
you're just pulling tons of current out

1695
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,920
of the bias t

1696
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,880
um this sdr device can handle that for a

1697
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,319
brief period of time but you basically

1698
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:53,760
overheat the uh

1699
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,040
overheat the linear regulator that

1700
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,880
powers that circuit and

1701
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,319
after a few seconds or something like

1702
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,240
that it will eventually burn out

1703
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,280
so yeah make sure you use the

1704
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,319
you use the uh

1705
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,079
use the lna between this device in your

1706
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,680
probe

1707
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,839
um let's go on the other side

1708
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,000
and let's

1709
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,119
plug in this guy

1710
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,400
now naturally you can follow along with

1711
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,520
the probes that you have

1712
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,880
i suggest you make a couple of different

1713
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,880
probes with loops of different sizes um

1714
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,240
all that sort of thing oh

1715
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,079
my apologies um i absolutely can stop

1716
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:40,559
screen

1717
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,839
share good call

1718
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,680
can i stop screen share can i only

1719
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,558
choose a different screen

1720
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,640
have i stopped okay cool taken care of

1721
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,559
yeah apologies about that um and also

1722
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,079
it's a gopro so

1723
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,000
my apologies that i'm not like rapidly

1724
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,160
switching lenses to make it more obvious

1725
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,520
uh it's just enough of a challenge as it

1726
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,000
is

1727
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,040
um oh i guess i'm actually gonna have to

1728
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,880
share my screen in a second anyway but

1729
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,000
um yeah i would make a couple of

1730
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,440
different sized probes and start with

1731
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,000
this one

1732
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,520
while we search around but in the

1733
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,280
meantime for now i'm just going to go

1734
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,000
ahead and

1735
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,520
and fire up my my sdr

1736
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,720
virtual machine and you can see what's

1737
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,319
going on

1738
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,559
so first things first um if you've got

1739
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:31,839
your virtual machine

1740
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,680
open and running you want to pass

1741
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,359
through your sdr device to that

1742
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,160
um i'm running parallels so this happens

1743
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:38,960
automatically

1744
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,720
because its performance is just a little

1745
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,319
bit better than virtualbox virtualbox

1746
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:43,440
kind of crawls to a halt and i'll show

1747
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,720
you how and why

1748
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,480
um so go up to menu devices

1749
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,079
pass through your pass through your

1750
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:57,680
rtl sdr device and

1751
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,160
that should be reflected yeah so my rtl

1752
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,599
sdr has passed through

1753
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:07,599
um let me actually share my screen now

1754
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,880
do do share screen

1755
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,960
parallel desktop share okay there we go

1756
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,520
um so i've got my rtl sdr plugged in

1757
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,599
it's passed through

1758
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,839
my virtual machine isn't responding

1759
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:30,400
to oh no

1760
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,160
oh no um there is one problem

1761
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,400
with dragon os lts at least in parallels

1762
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,280
i don't know if this problem will

1763
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,000
persist with

1764
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,200
your running this if you're running this

1765
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,319
in virtualbox but

1766
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:46,559
if dragon os goes to sleep uh

1767
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,559
mouse input doesn't work when it comes

1768
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,400
back out so we can see

1769
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,559
my desktop here it is not accepting any

1770
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:53,599
mouse input and

1771
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,119
suddenly the clicks will all flood

1772
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,400
through as soon as i like

1773
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,760
i i guess sleep and re-wake this device

1774
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,799
so instead i'm going to go uh

1775
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:09,599
restart this guy force restart it

1776
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,960
and hopefully that will come back nice

1777
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,359
and

1778
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,839
cleanly

1779
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,839
bear with me

1780
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,960
there we go okay cool there we are

1781
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,319
okay so first things first we're going

1782
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:36,000
to fire up um

1783
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,319
we're gonna fire up uh

1784
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,559
i guess let's start with let's start

1785
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,640
with key spectrum analyzer

1786
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,160
no no no i'm going to fire up uh

1787
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,319
sdr angel so let's fire up sdr until

1788
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:51,520
it's under the internet menu

1789
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,559
down here um

1790
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,440
we'll load this if you're using a

1791
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,440
different version of sdr angel i think

1792
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,000
this uh

1793
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
interface actually changed slightly so

1794
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,400
down here under sampling devices control

1795
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,640
rtl sdr is automatically selected for me

1796
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,920
if i click the like

1797
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,760
finger selection icon i don't know what

1798
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,680
it is you can pick from other devices

1799
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,960
i don't have anything else relevant

1800
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,960
plugged in right now so

1801
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,839
um it won't be a problem i'll hit cancel

1802
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:18,240
uh

1803
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,559
that menu is like a button up here or

1804
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,160
something and maybe a newer version of

1805
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,839
sdr angel or an older version i'm not

1806
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,200
actually even sure

1807
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,559
but i know i've selected the right one

1808
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,400
here so we'll go with that

1809
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,240
um recall that this is not operating as

1810
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,680
a swept spectrum analyzer this doesn't

1811
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,680
have any anything like that so the

1812
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,480
sample rate affects the maximum

1813
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,520
bandwidth span

1814
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,119
where previously i was setting that span

1815
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:42,640
to 100 megahertz and setting the center

1816
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,559
frequency at 50 megahertz over on the

1817
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,359
rsa right now i've set the center

1818
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:48,880
frequency at 100 megahertz

1819
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,319
a thousand or a hundred thousand

1820
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:51,920
kilohertz 100 megahertz

1821
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,880
um the span is set by the sample rate um

1822
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,359
so

1823
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:59,039
we've just got a 2.4 uh 2.4 mega samples

1824
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,880
a second which is a 2.4

1825
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,920
megahertz bandwidth it's i

1826
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,280
and q so shannon or nyquist is satisfied

1827
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:07,599
but

1828
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,400
anyway um i am going to throttle that

1829
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,799
down for now because

1830
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:16,240
uh i fear that this virtual machine

1831
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,680
isn't going to keep up i actually don't

1832
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,599
but yours might not so let's

1833
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:22,240
go down and knock that sample rate down

1834
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,920
to 950

1835
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,200
kilo samples a second and let's go down

1836
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,640
here in the spectrum display

1837
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,720
um you can leave the window as is we're

1838
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,000
going to switch the fft

1839
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,760
to 128 points

1840
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,720
we'll show what these toggle later but

1841
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,079
leave them as is for now

1842
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:41,680
and and we can play with them this

1843
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,599
basically makes the fft math a little

1844
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,359
bit easier for the vm to handle so if

1845
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:45,920
you're

1846
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,359
going to run into uh performance issues

1847
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:52,640
this won't immediately freeze your setup

1848
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,520
um if you do run into performance issues

1849
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,480
it's useless

1850
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,680
trying to poke around the interface

1851
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,680
until it comes back just exit the sdr

1852
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,319
application

1853
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:02,480
they're not well optimized for user

1854
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,240
experience they're well optimized for

1855
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,640
doing the math quickly so what we see

1856
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,640
here is um

1857
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,480
cool we've got that same like digital

1858
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,319
phosphor view from the

1859
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,480
rsa which is super neat we see that

1860
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,520
there's a

1861
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,880
nice bright peak at 100 megahertz

1862
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,480
and this is one of the disadvantages of

1863
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,400
using hardware like this is

1864
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,319
we do kind of have to question where

1865
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:25,920
that peak is coming from

1866
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,960
so if for instance i

1867
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,240
completely unplug my lna we notice that

1868
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,000
that peak actually still stays there so

1869
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,160
that could be something real

1870
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,079
or it could be a um

1871
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,000
an artifact of the actual sampling

1872
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,920
frequency like the the tuning frequency

1873
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,440
of the sdr

1874
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,640
or it could be um something internal to

1875
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,559
the sdr um

1876
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:53,760
just for giggles let's try bumping up

1877
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,119
a little bit and see if that frequency

1878
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:57,839
shifts around

1879
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,559
can i even do that yeah so we notice

1880
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:01,760
that that

1881
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,240
that peak on our tuning frequency

1882
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,920
doesn't go anywhere as i move the

1883
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,240
turning tuning frequency around subtly

1884
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,440
so basically that's not a real signal

1885
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,839
um we can kind of just ignore it from

1886
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:15,200
this point forward as being a real

1887
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,880
signal

1888
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,240
so um in my case i know that i

1889
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,839
want to go looking back at that 60

1890
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,520
megahertz signal on the alka tree

1891
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,359
um if you want to follow along on the

1892
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:27,200
tiny fpga if you've gotten to the point

1893
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:27,839
of actually

1894
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:31,200
flashing the firmware and whatnot um

1895
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,960
like flash the firmware and then browse

1896
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,400
around um

1897
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,200
basically you can look for the

1898
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,680
oscillator at 24 megahertz or the

1899
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,440
the signal line in question at 50

1900
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,200
megahertz but we'll get there in a sec

1901
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,839
i'll show you that board in a sec

1902
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:48,000
um before we go there

1903
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,480
i'm just going to quickly uh retune this

1904
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,680
sdr to 60 megahertz

1905
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,680
and i'm actually also i know this vm can

1906
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,520
handle it so i'm going to crank up the

1907
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,079
sample rate and everything um and we'll

1908
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:04,559
add

1909
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,760
some fft bins this still seems pretty

1910
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,799
performant

1911
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:11,599
2k okay cool um actually this is an

1912
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:12,880
interesting point when i

1913
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,720
cranked up the fft that peak got very

1914
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,640
much narrower so it's probably some

1915
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,880
uh unsuppressed artifact of the math or

1916
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,240
something that i'm just not

1917
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,839
quite understanding um it's still there

1918
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,440
a little bit but obviously it's

1919
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,440
it's basically one bin of the fft that's

1920
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,720
lit up so

1921
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,000
it's bias and you know we can thin it

1922
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,400
out

1923
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,920
we do notice that there are a couple of

1924
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,160
other lines at some even

1925
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,160
intervals so we're measuring subtly some

1926
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,839
harmonics of something but

1927
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:43,039
anyway so let's wave

1928
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,559
our new probe over that area

1929
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,920
and look at that something's happening

1930
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,119
cool that's super interesting um because

1931
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,559
we have that problem with the exact

1932
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,000
tuning frequency and we know

1933
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,400
that this signal is at 60 megahertz i'm

1934
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,359
gonna drop

1935
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,640
off slightly so that now actually i'll

1936
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,760
drop off

1937
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,359
very much more slightly uh so now we're

1938
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,160
actually

1939
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,760
interested in this peak over here um

1940
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,240
this way we're we're not conflating the

1941
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,520
signal that we're actually interested in

1942
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,399
measuring with

1943
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:19,120
with whatever like bias point we found

1944
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,799
um

1945
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:22,560
so if we come over here and wave our

1946
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,000
probe in that spot we

1947
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,839
see that really sharp line

1948
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,158
on that signal and actually some other

1949
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:31,520
harmonics going on in there that we

1950
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,479
didn't see before

1951
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,560
so that's super interesting and i

1952
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,520
haven't looked into

1953
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,640
what that might actually be or whatever

1954
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,479
if we move around we see some other nice

1955
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,880
sharp lines that pop out and those are

1956
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,640
very clearly artifacts and because we've

1957
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,799
got the spectrogram view here too

1958
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,399
we can see that uh

1959
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:51,759
you know seeing in the time in the

1960
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,238
waterfall diagram what's going on

1961
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:55,759
uh makes things a little bit clearer

1962
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,759
when we have such thin fft bins

1963
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:01,839
on this particular screen um

1964
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,120
actually just for giggles i'm gonna make

1965
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:07,040
the uh fxt a little shorter

1966
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,399
this will make the peaks a little bit

1967
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,158
wider and more obvious

1968
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:13,520
so now we're going to recreate the

1969
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,600
test that we had earlier of okay where

1970
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,679
is that where is that

1971
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,719
pin in question and rotate the probe so

1972
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:22,560
that it's basically

1973
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,679
um hoop perfectly

1974
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,880
projected down onto the wire of the pin

1975
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,880
and we're going to wave that around and

1976
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,319
try to figure out

1977
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,000
i guess it's a little bit tough here to

1978
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
see what the actual peak is

1979
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,600
um and our other tool will show this a

1980
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,520
little bit better for any particular

1981
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,960
case you basically have to feel around

1982
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,399
for the combination of settings

1983
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:46,080
and and tools that work best in that

1984
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:46,799
case

1985
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:48,399
we can see as we get close to this

1986
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:50,799
little capacitor that's right here

1987
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:54,080
that capacitor certainly has

1988
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,719
some serious current going into it at

1989
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:59,040
that 60 megahertz mark

1990
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,719
and obviously if i pull away that line

1991
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,560
goes kind of dim if i come in really

1992
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,840
close that line is

1993
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,400
nice and bright like we can really see

1994
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,159
something going on there

1995
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:10,159
and basically pinpoint which pin it is

1996
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:13,120
by figuring out where it's the brightest

1997
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:16,480
where we're moving our wand okay

1998
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,239
make that been even a little bit wider

1999
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:20,480
okay yeah

2000
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,000
that's nice so

2001
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,120
we've basically now built a like tiny

2002
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,800
spatial resolution probe that can show

2003
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,400
us exactly which pin

2004
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,440
on the ic is radiating the noise in

2005
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,280
question

2006
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:39,360
so let's go over and actually do this on

2007
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,599
the

2008
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,880
tiny fpga side my apologies that my tiny

2009
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,840
fpga tool chain is on my

2010
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,280
actual mac so this might get a little

2011
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,640
bit ridiculous

2012
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:58,239
um let me key myself up for

2013
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:01,350
some semblance of success here uh

2014
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:05,429
[Music]

2015
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,080
and i have to look past the camera too

2016
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,480
um

2017
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,960
oh the screen sharing there we go stop

2018
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,480
share

2019
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:18,480
screen share desktop

2020
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,400
two yes

2021
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,520
share cool okay

2022
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,560
um let me launch adam

2023
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:35,199
i'm gonna go to uh file

2024
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:38,239
open um

2025
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,199
apio template this is where i happened

2026
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:42,080
to clone the

2027
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,840
the project mine's called api oh

2028
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,280
template because i just never changed

2029
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,040
the directory name before i committed it

2030
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,960
um and we'll just open that entire

2031
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,320
folder

2032
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,880
uh and then we'll open top.v um you

2033
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,080
should be able to use the command

2034
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,719
line like apio program tool to do this

2035
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:57,120
um

2036
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,480
i decided that making you program a

2037
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,159
binary from the command line that i

2038
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:03,440
didn't give you code for was just too

2039
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,320
much effort

2040
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,440
so instead i will just first of all make

2041
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,000
sure that my

2042
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,520
timing fpga is actually plugged in

2043
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,000
won't get very far otherwise connect

2044
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,800
that to my mac

2045
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,120
and apio upload

2046
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,480
tiny huh

2047
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,440
cool um

2048
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,360
i'm actually going to show one thing

2049
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,560
quickly before i get any farther so

2050
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,320
notice how there are two leds and one of

2051
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,600
them is lit brightly and the other one

2052
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,080
is not

2053
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,320
let me reset this we see that that

2054
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,600
bottom led is now

2055
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,760
pulsating right and it's pulsating

2056
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,360
between zero brightness and

2057
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,960
like the brightness of the led adjacent

2058
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,040
to it when i go ahead and

2059
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,800
program this i just you know

2060
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,480
click program again basically it's in

2061
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,600
boot loader mode now it's actually

2062
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,719
running the uh

2063
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,080
running the gateway i

2064
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,600
notice how it's a little bit dimmer it's

2065
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,920
dimmer because i'm just blasting a 50

2066
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,600
megahertz signal out onto that

2067
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,960
led um which

2068
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,560
yeah don't do that or you won't pass

2069
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,520
emissions um

2070
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,080
so now that that's programmed and taken

2071
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:18,880
care of

2072
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,040
um and again this is where if you're

2073
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,320
having trouble with

2074
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,719
the tiny fpga side of things or whatever

2075
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:25,360
like

2076
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,840
i would follow the same sort of thing

2077
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,199
that i did on the aquatree board and

2078
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:30,560
find a signal of interest and

2079
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,520
and convince yourself what it might be

2080
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,000
by

2081
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,120
by feel effectively

2082
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:38,960
but we're going to go over and have a

2083
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,920
look at the

2084
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,880
tiny fpga board and see what's going on

2085
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,120
over there so i'm gonna

2086
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,719
retune over here i am going to

2087
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:56,800
stop share share

2088
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,080
my dragon os

2089
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,960
so we're back over here spinning the

2090
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,920
waveform

2091
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:15,839
okay we've got 50 megahertz

2092
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,920
50 megahertz is over here so we already

2093
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:20,560
know

2094
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,760
that i spun up

2095
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,920
a

2096
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,280
i basically just attached a pll output

2097
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,400
on the chip to

2098
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,920
some pin over here and if we start

2099
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,600
waving this wand around

2100
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,199
this one has very limited you know what

2101
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,159
we're just gonna start with the big one

2102
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,719
do it the way that we would expect we

2103
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,159
know from the test report

2104
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:43,840
the imaginary test report in this case

2105
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,840
that we failed on some 50 megahertz

2106
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,880
noise

2107
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,000
coming loudly from somewhere um

2108
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,120
we attach the big probe and start to try

2109
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,960
to look around where it might be

2110
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,800
it looks like it's not down at this end

2111
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,920
of the board but it's a little bit tough

2112
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,520
to say it's getting

2113
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,679
hotter it's getting hotter over here

2114
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:05,679
that's interesting okay so it's getting

2115
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:07,679
kind of hot in this area of the board

2116
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:08,080
like

2117
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:11,040
centered over the bx if we move over to

2118
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,880
the other side

2119
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,360
it's still pretty hot i don't know it's

2120
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,320
definitely somewhere

2121
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,040
up on that top half of the board and

2122
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,159
definitely

2123
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:22,159
less obvious down here definitely not

2124
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:23,520
the far corner of the board so it's

2125
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,239
probably not the spy flash device

2126
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:28,640
it might be the fpga itself but i'm not

2127
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,000
really sure

2128
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,520
probably not the usb because 50

2129
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,800
megahertz doesn't make a ton of sense

2130
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,159
and obviously as soon as we get up the

2131
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,679
cable the shielding no it's definitely

2132
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:36,719
not that

2133
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,600
so somewhere around here obviously you

2134
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,960
already know where it is because i told

2135
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:41,679
you i

2136
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:43,120
pumped a 50 megahertz signal out of the

2137
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,199
led but let's just

2138
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:48,159
verify that

2139
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:53,040
if i wind on this other probe

2140
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,960
okay um i'm gonna use the probe

2141
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,280
this is the like plane of the opening um

2142
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,800
i'm gonna wave it around above my board

2143
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,120
the same way i just did that other probe

2144
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,320
there's basically nothing to be seen

2145
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,679
because this probe is really not

2146
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:09,520
sensitive and weird turns out

2147
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,560
we're emanating the signal in a very

2148
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,400
specific spatial region

2149
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,679
um and this is why you start with the

2150
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:17,679
bigger probes because it'll give you a

2151
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,280
it'll it'll pick up much more and give

2152
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,920
you a an area to narrow in on

2153
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,440
if we wave this probe over here though

2154
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,920
we start to see that signal perk up

2155
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:29,040
and i'm not quite sure

2156
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,679
if we wave it directly over the fpga huh

2157
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,120
it seems to be up there

2158
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,080
that's definitely interesting oh

2159
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,280
something seems to be going on over

2160
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,239
there

2161
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:42,560
huh um if we zoom in really closely

2162
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,239
um i'm gonna move this over to the

2163
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:45,600
microscope in just a second so you can

2164
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,040
actually see i guess in the meantime

2165
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,120
i'll just change the

2166
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:53,840
big gopro lens uh let's see

2167
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,560
wait for it okay well it's not that much

2168
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:57,600
better

2169
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,040
um if you look closely

2170
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,960
we see that we've got a bunch of signal

2171
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,600
when i'm directly over the fpga

2172
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,600
we've got a bunch of signal when i'm

2173
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,600
over here in this corner it actually

2174
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,120
seems like it probably gets the loudest

2175
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,120
of anything

2176
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:16,400
and if i move over here we definitely

2177
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,600
still see the signal

2178
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,600
over here we don't practically see the

2179
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,440
signal oh that's not true we do see the

2180
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,960
signal in a couple of spots

2181
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,480
and that turns out it'll kind of make

2182
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,199
sense in a minute and

2183
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,120
over here we see the signal a bit but

2184
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,320
then let's do that

2185
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,610
i o pin trick where i put the probe

2186
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:34,800
[Music]

2187
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,199
basically um like a projected shadow of

2188
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,719
the trace that it's on

2189
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:40,800
but move around ooh i start to see a lot

2190
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,480
of stuff going on

2191
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,800
but there is a pin somewhere on this

2192
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,000
side of the board

2193
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,080
right about this is where having the uh

2194
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,960
the buzzer actually i don't know that

2195
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,480
it's worth the cost but it's certainly

2196
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,440
nice

2197
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,960
there's a pin somewhere right over here

2198
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,320
right about there maybe

2199
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,440
something like that that sound looks

2200
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,960
looks a little bit like something going

2201
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,320
on over here is probably what we're

2202
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,760
after

2203
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,800
let's have a look at this on the

2204
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,080
microscope and see

2205
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,480
what those physical structures are now

2206
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,000
that we've pinpointed them with our tiny

2207
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,120
little probe

2208
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,760
let's see what they actually look like

2209
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,320
they might be

2210
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:27,840
okay so here's the tiny fpga

2211
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:31,760
here's that main chip and up here

2212
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,199
well maybe i should just use my probe as

2213
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:35,120
a pointer

2214
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,239
up here

2215
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:41,920
is where we saw a bunch of that signal

2216
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,480
uh as we were like waving around over

2217
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,360
the fpga

2218
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,480
we saw a bunch right here we saw a bunch

2219
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,199
right there

2220
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:51,199
and we saw a bunch down here we saw a

2221
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:52,800
little bit up here

2222
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,560
well capacitors are

2223
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,640
definitely suspicious from a radiated

2224
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,320
noise standpoint especially when you're

2225
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,520
looking at

2226
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,320
at current through a trace basically

2227
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,159
what we're measuring is

2228
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,760
with the probe right here in this

2229
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,360
orientation

2230
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,520
we're measuring the current through that

2231
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,120
trace and into that capacitor

2232
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,679
so what we've basically measured is that

2233
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:18,080
capacitor is sinking a ton of rf current

2234
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,280
at the 50 megahertz

2235
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,320
that we can detect with our you know

2236
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:22,640
loop

2237
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,920
probe and ditto over here so what i'm

2238
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,480
willing to bet is that these capacitors

2239
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,600
here and here

2240
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,600
are probably i o bank filter capacitors

2241
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,520
and we're probably probably coupling

2242
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,640
noise onto the i o bank supply rail

2243
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,920
because we're driving a

2244
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,840
relatively low impedance device at a

2245
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,360
ludicrously high frequency

2246
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,040
this thing looks a bit like a capacitor

2247
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,120
as well as a resistor as well as a

2248
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,920
diode so we're really probably taxing

2249
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,960
that voltage rail

2250
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,199
pretty badly and we're seeing it in the

2251
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,159
form of

2252
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,239
um supply current from these capacitors

2253
01:19:58,239 --> 01:19:59,920
trying to keep that rail stable

2254
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,000
the other thing we might notice is

2255
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,080
this led comes over here oh i guess i

2256
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,280
wasn't even probing in the right place

2257
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,960
so it makes perfect sense that

2258
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,440
that we didn't actually see much up here

2259
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,880
when i was trying to test each of these

2260
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,639
individual traces and we did see a bunch

2261
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:15,679
down here

2262
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:17,920
um i never even got over to the proper

2263
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,520
place to measure which would have been

2264
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,600
this trace running down there on the top

2265
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,600
side of the fbga

2266
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,120
um just for giggles let's go back and

2267
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,199
see what that has to say about things

2268
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,199
uh because we should be able to see

2269
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,800
exactly which

2270
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,159
which pin is sourcing all of that

2271
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:36,080
current

2272
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:41,440
um i have to reprogram

2273
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,719
api upload

2274
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,320
still pulsating still in boot loader

2275
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,960
mode okay now i got a dim led

2276
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,560
we're good again okay

2277
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,840
cool so we know that the pin is up here

2278
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,000
somewhere

2279
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,760
if i stuff my probe oh look at that

2280
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,199
somewhere right up along that edge

2281
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:09,840
there's a nice bright 50 megahertz

2282
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,159
signal

2283
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:16,000
how about that cool

2284
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
so we've isolated exactly where that 50

2285
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,520
megahertz signal is coming from

2286
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,560
um i don't want to spoil the fun but you

2287
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,679
can start this now

2288
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,239
the sort of easter egg hunt is uh this

2289
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,000
signal is actually being piped out to

2290
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,520
a different place as well um

2291
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,360
somewhere else on this board has that

2292
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,280
same 50 megahertz signal on it

2293
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,679
and you should be able to use this same

2294
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:38,880
probe to find it

2295
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,080
because keep in mind even though there's

2296
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,480
no load attached to any of these pins

2297
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,560
there is a capacitance between the pin

2298
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,040
and and air and between the pin

2299
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,320
and its own ground plane and all the

2300
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,639
rest of it so we are

2301
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,719
loading a very very small value

2302
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:53,760
capacitor

2303
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,239
or rather piping into a very small value

2304
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:58,000
capacitor a relatively high frequency

2305
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:58,719
signal

2306
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:00,560
you should be able to measure a current

2307
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,400
on some trace even out to just the pad

2308
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,920
capacitance

2309
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,199
so if i zoom around

2310
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,760
i guess there is a little bit down here

2311
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,280
there's not so much over here this big

2312
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:11,679
loop

2313
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,679
probe shows that there's noise pretty

2314
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,120
much everywhere on the board but

2315
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,440
your job is basically use that small

2316
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,679
probe to try to figure out which pin

2317
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,840
the signal is piped out to and drop it

2318
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,440
in chat not that i think i'll be able to

2319
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,639
actually read it at this point

2320
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,280
but uh drop it in chat where you when

2321
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,520
you think you've gotten it and

2322
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,920
when you do go back over to the code um

2323
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,520
top.v

2324
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,960
and if you know verilog see if you can

2325
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:37,679
figure out

2326
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:39,520
make sense of where that signal is

2327
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,600
coming from and if you don't know

2328
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:42,960
verilog

2329
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,320
i guess basically just look for words

2330
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,679
that look

2331
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:51,520
like pins and you'll probably be able to

2332
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,400
figure out where it's

2333
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,560
attached up and then go look at that

2334
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,000
trace with your current probe

2335
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,600
like with your with your loop probe and

2336
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,120
you'll be able to see

2337
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,199
oh yeah it's definitely that particular

2338
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:02,639
pad that's getting lit up with

2339
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:04,480
with high frequency and not this other

2340
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,320
pad or whatever

2341
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,120
in the meantime i want to show you the

2342
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:09,920
last

2343
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,920
uh super cool and interesting tool in

2344
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,199
our tool kit which

2345
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:16,719
is q spectrum analyzer so obviously this

2346
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:17,920
is great if we know exactly what

2347
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,199
frequency we're looking at and we want

2348
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:20,000
to figure out how

2349
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,400
loud that frequency is um it's kind of

2350
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,400
on my to-do list at some point but

2351
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,840
almost certainly will never happen to

2352
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,600
add that like whistle mode

2353
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,760
where at the tuning frequency at the

2354
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,280
center frequency in one of these scr

2355
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,400
apps it'll just

2356
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,960
like power a whistle that increases in

2357
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,639
frequency and decreases in frequency

2358
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:37,120
with

2359
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,360
increasing rf power and decreasing rf

2360
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,560
power so like

2361
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,920
maybe it's between like 20 hertz

2362
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,679
at minus 100 db and and three kilohertz

2363
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:48,239
at

2364
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:51,440
at zero dbm and then you can

2365
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,560
wave your magic wand around at the

2366
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,920
tuning frequency and figure out exactly

2367
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:54,719
where on the board

2368
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,400
it is i'm sure you can probably whip

2369
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,239
that together with um

2370
01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:03,199
uh sdr sharp or uh gqrx or not gqrx um

2371
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:04,560
i don't know one of the one of the sdr

2372
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,800
tool chains i'm sure g and uscr

2373
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,159
you can probably whip that together in

2374
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:10,960
two seconds um as just like an rf power

2375
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,320
meter at the tuning frequency

2376
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,000
but it would be cool to do it with this

2377
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,800
same um dpo style view so that you can

2378
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,040
see what's going on around it as well

2379
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,679
um oh god okay cool it didn't go to

2380
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:22,159
sleep

2381
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:23,199
i thought that was going to be another

2382
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:26,000
restart um

2383
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
but again this is only really useful if

2384
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,600
we've got this sort of narrow bandwidth

2385
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,600
so let's go try something else

2386
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,199
and and i guess this would be a good

2387
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:34,639
time to interject with

2388
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:37,679
um sort of the merits of different sers

2389
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:40,159
so we've been using this rtl fdr

2390
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,520
this entire time and really the only

2391
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,880
reason we've been doing that is because

2392
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,840
it's super cheap

2393
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,320
it's rarely the best sdr for the job

2394
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,040
it's just

2395
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,719
super cheap so if you can get away with

2396
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,480
it you ought to because then you don't

2397
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:51,840
have to go spend money

2398
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,520
um the key figures of merit that are

2399
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,280
relevant for any of these sdrs

2400
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,280
is there there are basically two that

2401
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,199
matter most one of which is real-time

2402
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:02,560
bandwidth and one of which

2403
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,920
is uh total tuning range so for this rtl

2404
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,679
scr the real-time bandwidth is 2.4

2405
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:08,400
megahertz

2406
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,280
um and the total tuning range is what 24

2407
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,320
megahertz to

2408
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,000
like 1.7 gigahertz or something like

2409
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,080
that which means that

2410
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,679
this sdr is not useful for bluetooth

2411
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:21,600
because it can't tune to 2.4 gigahertz

2412
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,440
and it also can't tune the entire 80

2413
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,840
megahertz 2.4 gigahertz spectrum so that

2414
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,679
the 2.4 gigahertz we all know and love

2415
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,760
for bluetooth low energy and regular

2416
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,880
bluetooth and

2417
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,080
wi-fi exists between 2 gigahertz

2418
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:38,840
or sorry 2.40 gigahertz and

2419
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,120
2.480 gigahertz

2420
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,880
i'm sure it's slightly off of that

2421
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,960
anyway it's 80 megahertz wide which

2422
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,159
means that this

2423
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:49,360
sdr can't tune all of it at once um

2424
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,880
so it's not useful for that and it also

2425
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,639
is too high you can only go lower than

2426
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:53,199
that

2427
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,280
it is useful for something like adsb

2428
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,719
which has a much narrower

2429
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:58,639
signal bandwidth and is at a much lower

2430
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:00,239
tuning frequency i don't even remember

2431
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:01,280
what it is like

2432
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,080
1064 or something like that 1.064

2433
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,520
megahertz i don't remember

2434
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,960
anyway um for our purposes obviously the

2435
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,800
tuning band of interest is

2436
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,400
30 meg for this test report that i just

2437
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,400
showed you 30 megahertz to 1 gigahertz

2438
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,800
which the rtl sdr covers nicely so it's

2439
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,080
useful for that

2440
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,159
um and then the question that really

2441
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:21,679
remains is how do we get better

2442
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:22,880
bandwidth to actually cover that whole

2443
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,360
span so one way is spend more money on

2444
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,080
an sdr

2445
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,120
so uh this rtl sdr has

2446
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:33,440
2.4 megahertz bandwidth this hack rf1

2447
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,679
has 20 megahertz bandwidth so like

2448
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:37,440
nearly a 10x improvement

2449
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,480
this lime sdr has 60 megahertz bandwidth

2450
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,920
so three times improvement even over

2451
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,639
that

2452
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:44,880
and 60 megahertz is like dangerously

2453
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:45,920
close to

2454
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,560
to that 80 megahertz wide like 2.4

2455
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,400
gigahertz spectrum so like that's kind

2456
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,120
of neat

2457
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,040
turns out it's not still altogether that

2458
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,159
useful but like

2459
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:56,159
getting close it's definitely a lot more

2460
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:57,440
useful for certain applications where

2461
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,480
like if you're

2462
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,719
hunting around for sub 100 megahertz

2463
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:01,520
noise

2464
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,280
cool you can see nearly all of it

2465
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,199
between 30 and 100 megahertz and one

2466
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:09,120
one capture on this guy um

2467
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:12,719
the cooler aspect of this guy is that

2468
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:13,360
its

2469
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,560
uh tuning range is between like nine

2470
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,000
nine megahertz or nine kilohertz i think

2471
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,920
it's nine megahertz and

2472
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,000
six gigahertz so this covers basically

2473
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,360
the entire

2474
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,800
practical um rf testing regime

2475
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,840
from uh 30 megahertz to

2476
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,120
one gigahertz and then from one

2477
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,960
gigahertz technically the higher range

2478
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,960
is one gigahertz to like 13 gigahertz

2479
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:35,920
but

2480
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,239
at least in my experience kind of just

2481
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,080
ignore it if it's too high because you

2482
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,840
probably don't want to go spend

2483
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,320
you know 30 thousand dollars on a month

2484
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,639
on a 13 gigahertz scope

2485
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:49,520
or not scope um spectrum analyzer and if

2486
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,199
you do like at that point 500

2487
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,600
an hour for your rf testing facility is

2488
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,840
like okay fine yeah we'll suffer it

2489
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,440
um your product probably doesn't have

2490
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,800
any violations that high unless you're

2491
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,639
trying really really hard

2492
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:02,080
at least in my experience which is

2493
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,760
limited yours might be better

2494
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,080
um

2495
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,159
so like each of these devices offers

2496
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:11,679
some different aspects that may or may

2497
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:14,159
not be super useful to you like

2498
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:17,280
like the absolute range of this device

2499
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,280
it goes up to 3.6 gigahertz something

2500
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,719
like that so this can cover

2501
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,239
wi-fi and can cover a bunch more

2502
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:24,800
interesting bands than the rtl sdr cam

2503
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,199
um it's also transmit and receive um at

2504
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:28,239
full blue plus transit

2505
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:30,239
receive the hack our app is transmit and

2506
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:31,280
receive but

2507
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,800
not full duplex obviously transmit

2508
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,400
doesn't matter for us but these are all

2509
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,520
things to consider

2510
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,880
um but yeah these

2511
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,280
these devices i'll show you why they're

2512
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,639
well why one of them is really

2513
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,400
particularly useful in a moment

2514
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,360
um the question that that discussion

2515
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,880
started with is

2516
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,880
what do we do about the fact that we

2517
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,440
have a really really narrow window

2518
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,600
uh into the spectrum with this device at

2519
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,679
only 2.4 megahertz wide

2520
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:58,960
how do we capture more than that like

2521
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,880
for instance earlier i was capturing

2522
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,639
from 30 to 100 megahertz because i

2523
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,080
figured there might be some crystal

2524
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,520
oscillators on this board

2525
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,800
i knew they wouldn't be above 100

2526
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,239
megahertz but they're probably in that

2527
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:09,120
region right

2528
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,920
like single digit tens of megahertz how

2529
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:12,639
do we capture

2530
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,960
all of that well let's close down sdr

2531
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,480
angel because it's not going to help

2532
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,280
and let's fire up uh education q

2533
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,480
spectrum analyzer

2534
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,080
q spectrum analyzer is a program that

2535
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,880
basically tries to approximate a swept

2536
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:25,440
spectrum

2537
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,719
spectrum analyzer using sdr devices as

2538
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:30,639
real-time sdr devices so effectively

2539
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:32,159
what it does is

2540
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:35,120
um the same thing that the rsa was in

2541
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,639
that mode where it was capturing a chunk

2542
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:38,320
capturing a chunk capturing a chunk

2543
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,159
this does that same thing although it

2544
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,840
doesn't do the entire like

2545
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,199
digital phosphor where it captures a

2546
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:44,880
gazillion samples of one chunk it just

2547
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,960
captures one and moves on

2548
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,920
but it does accomplish our goals

2549
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,120
somewhat nicely

2550
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,800
so if we go up to settings this is still

2551
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,360
with my rtl sdr plugged in

2552
01:29:55,360 --> 01:30:00,159
change back end to rtl power fftw

2553
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:02,000
um you shouldn't have to change any

2554
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,600
other settings in here sample range

2555
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,040
should still be 2.56

2556
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:08,000
megahertz bandwidth zeros just default

2557
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,560
um

2558
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,600
local oscillator same deal um this is

2559
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,639
useful if you have

2560
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,239
an external like up converter or

2561
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:15,840
something like that

2562
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,679
um and we'll leave waterfall history at

2563
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,760
100.

2564
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,760
uh let's do that same test that i was

2565
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,600
doing before

2566
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,080
well it might actually be a little bit

2567
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:26,800
easier to

2568
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,920
let's let's go between

2569
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,679
uh let's go between 100 megahertz and

2570
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:33,199
102 megahertz

2571
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:35,120
one uh because we'll capture like a

2572
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,880
radio station as a

2573
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,159
demo signal 100 megahertz and 102

2574
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:41,360
megahertz

2575
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,880
um if you're running in um

2576
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,280
if you're running in virtualbox this

2577
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,639
would be a good place to make the bin

2578
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,080
size relatively large

2579
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,199
um let's go with a hundred megahertz

2580
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:55,120
if i can why is my keyboard suddenly not

2581
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,440
working um let's go with 100 megahertz

2582
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,880
bin size

2583
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,600
um this will make the fft a little bit

2584
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:02,480
saner

2585
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:05,679
um do the setting uh do the interval

2586
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:09,679
um to 0.01 basically this is

2587
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:12,159
continue streaming as quickly as you can

2588
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:14,239
rather than pausing in between

2589
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:17,199
and just for giggles i'm going to oh i

2590
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:18,719
had that checked earlier never mind

2591
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:21,679
i'm going to do a single shot okay okay

2592
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:22,480
cool

2593
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,719
that's a good sign um so i'm going to

2594
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:26,400
click start and we'll see that

2595
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,880
this is coming in pretty quickly there

2596
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,320
are clearly a couple of peaks

2597
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:33,360
this is basically useless guarded um i

2598
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,800
don't even have an antenna attached to

2599
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:35,440
this thing but

2600
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:39,199
it's really you know pretty loud so

2601
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:41,440
um if i attach it that's not gonna work

2602
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,360
at all um

2603
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,679
let's just leave it it should be loud

2604
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:46,560
enough to notice

2605
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,000
um one thing that's a little bit

2606
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,239
annoying is that it defaults to

2607
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:53,280
um y-axis scaling so i'm just going to

2608
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,440
go into y-axis click manual

2609
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:59,120
um click minus 80 db

2610
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,239
for the low end um

2611
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:05,840
and let's do 0 db for the high end

2612
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,239
cool that shows us at least on a static

2613
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:09,679
view what's going on

2614
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:11,040
now i know this virtual machine can

2615
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,239
handle a little bit more in terms of

2616
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:13,760
performance so i'm going to click stop

2617
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,520
i'm going to knock the bin size down to

2618
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,159
10 kilohertz and click start that's

2619
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:19,280
starting to look pretty good

2620
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:23,920
like this is clearly a radio station um

2621
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,239
i guess that's probably what 100

2622
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,639
this might actually be so another

2623
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,320
another key point of sdr devices that

2624
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,760
their internal clocks might not be

2625
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,960
right this might be 100.9 and it's

2626
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,320
the local oscillator isn't actually

2627
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:43,360
accurate on this uh smarty sdr that

2628
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,639
local oscillator actually should be

2629
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:46,159
quite accurate so maybe i am measuring

2630
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:47,280
this correctly

2631
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,040
i don't know what the actual radio

2632
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,040
station is so maybe it is one at one

2633
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,280
point

2634
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:56,320
i don't know it's not it's not 101. okay

2635
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,880
earth 101 yeah yeah no maybe it is 101.

2636
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,239
my bad anyway um clearly this is a radio

2637
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:02,960
station

2638
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,320
clearly this is an adjacent radio

2639
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,679
station clearly this is an adjacent

2640
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:06,719
radio station

2641
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:09,040
so we're in good shape we know we can

2642
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,800
actually measure

2643
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,800
at least radio stations i'm going to get

2644
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,920
aggressive and knock the fft

2645
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,159
down another peg and now we start to get

2646
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,400
really interesting data

2647
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,560
you also notice the frame rate seems to

2648
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,920
be a little slower maybe

2649
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,520
tough to say for sure but we'll we'll

2650
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,960
stick with this

2651
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,560
now let's see if we can sweep out the

2652
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,880
entire um

2653
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,880
the entire fm frequency range so we're

2654
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,199
going to go from 87 megahertz

2655
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:38,880
to 108 and we'll see

2656
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,159
what this looks like notice it

2657
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:45,280
updates much slower so the

2658
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,280
frame rate has dropped precipitously and

2659
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,560
if i

2660
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,440
stop it and knock that bin size back up

2661
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,880
to

2662
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,960
hell let's make it one megahertz so this

2663
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,280
is gonna be super fast to calculate math

2664
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:57,920
right

2665
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,960
notice it still chunks in at like

2666
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,800
you know a frame a second or two frames

2667
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,080
a second or something like that

2668
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,520
clearly the math isn't the problem

2669
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,800
what's happening here is

2670
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,239
the sdr device itself is tuning to

2671
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:15,360
this frequency range and sending data

2672
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,719
tuning to this frequency range and

2673
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:18,320
sending data tuning to this frequency

2674
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,760
range and sending data tuning this

2675
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,360
frequency range inside of data

2676
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:24,239
by the looks of things it takes one two

2677
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:24,960
three

2678
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,480
four five six seven eight

2679
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,600
nine nine separate spectrum captures to

2680
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,880
build up the spectrum

2681
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,080
that we're the spectrogram that we're

2682
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,000
seeing now on the flip side

2683
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,239
what's cool is we see that like all of

2684
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,520
these radio stations are

2685
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,280
like totally coming right through i

2686
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,280
count one two

2687
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:47,119
probably three four five six seven

2688
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:49,360
eight nine i don't think so i don't know

2689
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,880
how frequently the radio stations are

2690
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,159
actually spaced i guess it's 0.3

2691
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:53,600
megahertz so they're probably

2692
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:54,800
like all of these lower peaks are

2693
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,360
probably actually uh just weaker radio

2694
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,480
stations but

2695
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,080
very clear that there are a bunch going

2696
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,000
on here and this is effectively what we

2697
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,440
can do with our near field probe

2698
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:06,880
on our own board so let's

2699
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,760
switch this frequency regime from that

2700
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:10,080
to

2701
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:14,880
we'll go 30 megahertz to 100 megahertz

2702
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:18,000
that's a pretty wide band

2703
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,400
and will probably take quite a while to

2704
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,880
capture and we see indeed it does

2705
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,080
like we're one two three we're getting

2706
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,960
a very low frame rate here and in fact

2707
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:29,840
we see that we've got

2708
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,800
all of that all of that radio station

2709
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,639
noise going on up here

2710
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:36,800
one thing you'll also see is there's a

2711
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,800
dip in between each thing that's because

2712
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:39,679
the

2713
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:42,639
the spectrum captured by the sdr

2714
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:44,400
actually falls off towards the edges of

2715
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,679
the real-time bandwidth and we can see

2716
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:47,360
that in the spectrogram with these like

2717
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:48,960
darker lines

2718
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,280
so even beyond this what we actually

2719
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,320
want to do

2720
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,960
is add a crop i'm going to go with 20

2721
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,719
which basically just

2722
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:59,679
overlaps the adjacent spectrum chunks by

2723
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:00,480
20

2724
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,400
and cuts them off next to each other to

2725
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,639
try to to try to level that out

2726
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:06,320
at the expense of taking longer to

2727
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,920
capture spectrum but that sure looks a

2728
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,159
lot flatter doesn't it so

2729
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:11,600
these are pretty good settings this is

2730
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,760
what we'll go with and

2731
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,440
let's hook up the

2732
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,280
let's hook up the bigger loop near field

2733
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,600
probe that i was using earlier

2734
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,840
and

2735
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,560
hang out over this board and see what

2736
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:31,920
pops up

2737
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,600
we got a lot going on here don't we

2738
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,639
i sure see a nice bright

2739
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:44,080
big happy peak around 50 megahertz

2740
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,800
interestingly i see another peak right

2741
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:47,600
below it

2742
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,760
i'm gonna go ahead and call that 48

2743
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,040
megahertz

2744
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,119
um we've got a whole lot of stuff going

2745
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:55,119
on up above 70 megahertz but

2746
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:56,639
frankly i'm just gonna ignore that for

2747
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:58,560
now let's

2748
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,440
see about zooming in on that area and

2749
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,199
obviously the disadvantage of doing this

2750
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:04,800
and this is where your

2751
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,679
you know cost constraint uh is a

2752
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:08,239
trade-off

2753
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,000
between features and convenience and

2754
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,480
money because this updates like one

2755
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,639
chunk every couple of seconds

2756
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:16,159
like this tells us what's going on

2757
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:17,520
everywhere in the spectrum but not

2758
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,880
everywhere in the board if i wave my

2759
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,639
wand around like

2760
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:22,400
whatever section of the spectrum it

2761
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,000
happened to be sampling

2762
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,560
in that time will get caught so like

2763
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:27,440
we've got this thing

2764
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:30,320
i'm gonna click it and then take my

2765
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,360
sample away

2766
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:34,000
and we're gonna see like like weird

2767
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,679
sections of the spectrum have changed

2768
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:38,159
and not all uniformly

2769
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:41,199
but anyway what we do now is okay we see

2770
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:42,320
those peaks we see

2771
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,800
like 48 and 50 megahertz as as

2772
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:45,840
definitely peaks

2773
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,239
so let's narrow our gaze a little bit

2774
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:49,280
and

2775
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,960
search just between 45 and 55 megahertz

2776
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:56,480
um that's still more than

2777
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,840
my keyboard again not working 45 and 55

2778
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,639
megahertz

2779
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:03,520
that's um still more than the real-time

2780
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,360
bandwidth of our sdr so it's not going

2781
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,480
to happen instantly

2782
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,320
but oh boy that certainly happens a

2783
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:11,119
whole lot faster

2784
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,600
if we take our probe and wave it over

2785
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,639
and this is another one of those

2786
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:15,600
situations where

2787
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,840
we've got a lot of peaks going on here

2788
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,520
and if i

2789
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,119
simply unplug the atlanta

2790
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:24,800
ah that's interesting all of those

2791
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,320
disappear and the noise floor drops

2792
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,360
precipitously

2793
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,920
so we are actually measuring some

2794
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,040
artifact of either

2795
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,639
rf interference that's going on in the

2796
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:34,159
room right now which is entirely

2797
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:35,119
plausible

2798
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:38,800
or yeah i think we're actually measuring

2799
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,880
real rf because if i unplug our antenna

2800
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,480
completely from the

2801
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,320
completely from the uh low noise

2802
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,719
amplifier the noise floor drops as well

2803
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,560
as all of those individual spikes

2804
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,199
so what we're seeing on the spectrogram

2805
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:52,080
here is real

2806
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,360
who knows where it's coming from i'm not

2807
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,199
going to try to find out for now what we

2808
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:56,239
definitely see is

2809
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:58,239
there is a colossal 48 megahertz peak

2810
01:38:58,239 --> 01:38:59,760
there and there is a

2811
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:03,760
colossal 50 megahertz peak there so

2812
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,440
and as we move it around we see

2813
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,199
different things happening so this is

2814
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:08,960
definitely what we're kind of looking

2815
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,320
for and

2816
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,840
what i really like about cue spectrum

2817
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,679
analyzer is

2818
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:17,119
at this point we can uh just narrow in a

2819
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:18,239
little bit further

2820
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:23,199
let's go with 49.

2821
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,080
49.85

2822
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:29,679
oh it's let's go 49.5

2823
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:33,760
and 50.5

2824
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,520
um so that's definitely within one

2825
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:38,560
spectrum

2826
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,840
and as soon as we

2827
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,639
if we successfully start it i don't know

2828
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:47,360
maybe i have to tune one full spectrum

2829
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:49,920
49

2830
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:55,840
and 51.

2831
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,600
i guess i can't tune that narrow it

2832
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,639
doesn't like it um

2833
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:03,920
and at this point i would probably

2834
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,159
reduce my bin size too but this is now

2835
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:08,480
going nice and fast that i can

2836
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,800
wave my magic wand around the board and

2837
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,600
figure out

2838
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,480
oh yeah it's definitely worse up here

2839
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,040
and

2840
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,639
there's something going on down in this

2841
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:19,360
bottom right corner

2842
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,040
but it's definitely worse the closer i

2843
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,199
get to the led

2844
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:24,800
and you can do all of this in q spectrum

2845
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,480
analyzer you can also add some

2846
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,040
nice features if your vm is up to the

2847
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,560
task which i've definitely had

2848
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:34,480
mixed mixed success with but we can add

2849
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:37,280
some level of persistence i'm gonna drop

2850
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,600
the bin size to one kilohertz just to

2851
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,119
make it a little bit prettier um

2852
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:46,559
we can add some persistence where

2853
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:48,080
now we're starting to get a little bit

2854
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,679
of that um

2855
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:51,520
a little bit of that digital phosphor

2856
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:53,199
effect

2857
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:55,119
a little bit poor man's compared to sdr

2858
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:57,280
angel so if you're in one

2859
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,800
if you're in one span you might as well

2860
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,239
want to switch over oh it looks like the

2861
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:01,440
noise floor is actually coming from my

2862
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,639
esd mat

2863
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:06,239
that's cool um and this is one of those

2864
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:07,360
areas where it might be

2865
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,800
better to have a properly shielded probe

2866
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,000
maybe that's actually what we're picking

2867
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,520
up but obviously this is still useful

2868
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,199
even given that

2869
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:15,520
um anyway i like doing this kind of work

2870
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,239
kind of stuck

2871
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:17,760
in q spectrum analyzer because it's

2872
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,360
flexible enough to do

2873
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,520
to do swept bandwidth and multiple

2874
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:22,880
multiple captures

2875
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,600
in sweep mode or like zoom in for

2876
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,280
effectively real-time analysis on

2877
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:30,320
on one real-time bandwidth segment

2878
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:33,360
that sort of thing um i hope i've given

2879
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:34,639
you enough to

2880
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:36,239
play around while i've just been talking

2881
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:37,679
for like the last half an hour

2882
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:40,080
and like actually have a decent time

2883
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,280
sniffing around signals on your own

2884
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:41,920
boards

2885
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,760
but i do want to show you one last thing

2886
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,119
to maybe what your appetite if you have

2887
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:46,880
to do this seriously

2888
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:50,560
um i would probably recommend getting a

2889
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:53,920
an a hack rf rather this hack rf

2890
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:57,280
has one massive colossal excellent

2891
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,080
feature

2892
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,520
as far as key spectrum analyzer is

2893
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,520
concerned which is

2894
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,639
it has a swept swept measurement mode

2895
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:08,320
so where cue spectrum analyzer

2896
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,040
and rtl power ffcw and all these

2897
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,800
libraries back ends basically

2898
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,360
capture one section section of seg uh

2899
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:16,480
section of spectrum

2900
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,159
move to the next section capture move to

2901
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:19,440
the next section capture and so on and

2902
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:20,159
so forth

2903
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:23,360
cue spectrum or pack rf

2904
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:26,800
has a hack rf sweep support where

2905
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,880
it behaves completely like a swept

2906
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,000
spectrum analyzer

2907
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,800
that obviously has its disadvantages but

2908
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,639
the sweep rate on this thing is

2909
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,560
super duper fast so let's see what that

2910
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:37,920
actually looks like

2911
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,880
i am going to stop i am going to

2912
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,080
unfortunately i'm going to unplug my

2913
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:43,119
tiny fpva

2914
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:46,239
because i need the usb port um so i'm

2915
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:47,520
just going to demo this on the

2916
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:52,159
outputry board but

2917
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,199
let's connect you to dragon os

2918
01:42:57,199 --> 01:43:00,880
um i'm going to go to settings uh

2919
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,920
hack rf sweep i am going to leave all of

2920
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,679
the other settings default

2921
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:08,239
and let's do this same spectrum that we

2922
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:10,480
were just measuring so we're gonna go

2923
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,840
um again there's sort of a theme here

2924
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,760
choosing settings that you are almost

2925
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,840
certain will work uh from the get go

2926
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,560
is usually the best choice um and then

2927
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,320
you could throttle up the

2928
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,000
level of math that your computer and

2929
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,199
software is going to have to do from

2930
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:25,600
there

2931
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,280
so let's go 49 megahertz and

2932
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,400
50 megahertz which is well within the 20

2933
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,920
megahertz capture band

2934
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,480
uh real time bandwidth of this guy i'm

2935
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,159
gonna go with 10 kilohertz

2936
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:41,760
and let's see okay cool oh my goodness

2937
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,400
it's capturing

2938
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,639
fast enough that i actually think i

2939
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:48,560
locked it up um i think i needed to set

2940
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:49,840
the settings interval

2941
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:53,040
the interval to 0.01 again okay just

2942
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,960
gonna

2943
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:58,320
kill a q spectrum analyzer

2944
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,199
we're gonna we're gonna retry that um

2945
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:04,800
as fast as you can might have been

2946
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,320
overzealous 0.01

2947
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:12,480
um we are still on hacker f sweep

2948
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:16,879
let's go 49

2949
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,920
51. oh actually on the board i'm gonna

2950
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:20,560
demo it's

2951
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:22,239
the 60 megahertz is the key so we're

2952
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,000
going to go with 61

2953
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,360
and 59

2954
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:31,040
and bin size 10 kilohertz start

2955
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:34,239
there we go cool notice that this is

2956
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:37,440
mind-blowingly fast so the hack rf just

2957
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,119
has an update rate much faster than the

2958
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:41,360
uh

2959
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,960
much faster than the rtl sdr in the

2960
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,840
first place minus

2961
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:49,520
one um

2962
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:52,000
the hacker f is faster than the rtl sdr

2963
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,520
in the first place

2964
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,360
uh and also has a wider bandwidth so

2965
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:57,760
it's

2966
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,639
it's faster from a bunch of different

2967
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:02,400
inspect uh

2968
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:05,600
weight 59 and 61. oh okay

2969
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:07,199
interesting point that's happened here

2970
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:09,280
i'm getting the entire capture bandwidth

2971
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,159
of the

2972
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:13,280
um hacker f1 so

2973
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:15,119
there's there wasn't any advantage to

2974
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:16,800
begin with but for the sake of making

2975
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,560
the display look convenient i'm

2976
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:20,000
gonna actually center on the 60

2977
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,560
megahertz so we're going to start at

2978
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:25,600
um 50 megahertz and

2979
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:29,040
go to 70 megahertz this at least will

2980
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,840
center my 60 megahertz frequency of

2981
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,520
interest

2982
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:37,679
um let's bring over the alka tree board

2983
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:45,840
have a sniff around

2984
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,840
that's slightly unexpected do i have

2985
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:56,880
something going on

2986
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:00,000
i'm not noticing a

2987
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:06,560
a particularly substantial

2988
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,000
increase when i actually slip around

2989
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,840
that thing

2990
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:22,960
i wonder if my setup is actually

2991
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,639
slightly too noisy for this test case or

2992
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:26,400
something like that

2993
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:29,280
that doesn't make a ton of sense hey

2994
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:30,239
alex

2995
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:32,880
yeah hey you uh you're not connected to

2996
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,280
the hacker

2997
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:41,839
you're you're coaxing

2998
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:51,360
without any amplification or receive

2999
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:52,960
antag well that'll explain why it

3000
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,440
doesn't matter how i move my

3001
01:46:55,440 --> 01:47:00,000
magic wand nice spot

3002
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,920
um and actually a secondary point

3003
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,920
because the hack rf does not have

3004
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:07,119
a um does not have a bias t built in

3005
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:08,159
we're gonna have to power the

3006
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:10,880
lna from an external source to make it

3007
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,480
even turn on

3008
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,280
so that makes things more interesting it

3009
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:16,239
also

3010
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:19,599
did i do i click

3011
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:23,280
oh that's that's a lot better

3012
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:26,000
wow and in fact we can see something

3013
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,520
particularly cool here which looks like

3014
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,119
we've got some sort of spread spectrum

3015
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:30,400
something going on we see that like

3016
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,280
barber pole effect in the um

3017
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:36,560
uh in the spectrogram in the waterfall

3018
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,119
something is rapidly changing its center

3019
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:41,440
frequency

3020
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,880
over this range it looks like maybe

3021
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,000
that's the switching converter or

3022
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,280
something like that we can have a look

3023
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,199
a little bit closer now we can

3024
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:49,920
definitely see that 60 megahertz peak

3025
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,280
driving

3026
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:53,679
up and down as i as i move around near

3027
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:54,400
the uh

3028
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,679
near the offending pen um it looks a

3029
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,520
whole lot like

3030
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,159
i'm off the charts there yep and i

3031
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:03,679
stopped directly on top of that

3032
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:05,760
decoupling capacitor that i believe is

3033
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,639
just

3034
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:09,920
right next to the 60 megahertz output um

3035
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:11,840
yeah so that's a pretty successful test

3036
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,119
in my book

3037
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:16,560
the last thing i want to show is

3038
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,199
okay we're within the real-time

3039
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:20,320
bandwidth of this

3040
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,840
device right now so it makes sense that

3041
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,719
the update rate is is pretty fast

3042
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:27,679
in point of fact i don't know if it's

3043
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:28,239
even

3044
01:48:28,239 --> 01:48:29,520
capturing the full real-time bandwidth

3045
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:30,960
right now i'm not sure how i'm not sure

3046
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:31,440
how

3047
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,920
hack rf sweep is implemented if it's

3048
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,199
still actually sweeping a tuning

3049
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:37,440
frequency or if it's just capturing one

3050
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,960
one chunk of content a day um if i

3051
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:46,800
start at 30 megahertz

3052
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:50,239
30 megahertz and jump up to

3053
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:54,879
100 megahertz so this is that entire

3054
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:59,520
this is still capturing pretty dang

3055
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,840
zippy

3056
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:06,800
um oh that's my cursor at 70 megahertz

3057
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:07,760
it looks like

3058
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,080
uh

3059
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,679
is it that looks like a grid line at 70

3060
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:14,320
megahertz

3061
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,760
not actually a line either that or it's

3062
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,440
just a really really narrow line

3063
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,760
i don't actually know what's going on

3064
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,679
that looks very odd to me

3065
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:25,760
it looks like it's a stuff perching um

3066
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:28,960
yeah i think i would ignore that anyway

3067
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,800
let's plug in our our big wide probe

3068
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,080
and look around we've got

3069
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:40,159
basically the the like rsa

3070
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:43,360
speed granted it's just on a peak line

3071
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:44,480
but over

3072
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,960
that massive bandwidth and we can see

3073
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,639
all of those peaks

3074
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:51,040
um so the the hack rf is really really

3075
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,320
good for this kind of work

3076
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:56,159
um because it supports great sort of

3077
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:58,320
pseudo swept spectrum analysis features

3078
01:49:58,320 --> 01:49:59,920
just for giggles

3079
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:03,280
let's i think it actually might be the

3080
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:05,440
cursor yeah it is the cursor it's just

3081
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,599
so stuck that i can't do anything about

3082
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:11,360
it i probably need to um

3083
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,599
i probably need to make the bin size a

3084
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:15,840
little bit bigger to

3085
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:18,239
make the math a little easier let's kill

3086
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:18,960
that

3087
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:23,679
and start again one regular theme of

3088
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:25,520
at least in my experience sdr software

3089
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,440
is that frequently just

3090
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,679
restarting the software is actually the

3091
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:33,280
best and fastest strategy

3092
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:38,719
um so let's go from 30 megahertz

3093
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:41,599
all the way up to six gigahertz and see

3094
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:45,360
exactly how fast that happens

3095
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,560
how cool is that we're getting basically

3096
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,880
like one hertz update rate of the

3097
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,920
entire frequency spectrum that we are

3098
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,320
capable of measuring with this device

3099
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:59,760
and what's doubly cool is we see a lot

3100
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:00,239
of

3101
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:03,520
a lot of spikes popping in i am

3102
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,760
nearly certain those aren't our device

3103
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,119
especially given how intermittent they

3104
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:07,760
are

3105
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,920
but keep in mind that i am immediately

3106
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,280
next to a

3107
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:14,480
a mesh network base station

3108
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,119
blasting 2.4 gigahertz frequently enough

3109
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:19,199
to mess up all my bluetooth devices

3110
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:22,719
and also five gigahertz wi-fi so

3111
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:24,400
i'd be willing to bet that that 2.4

3112
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:26,080
gigahertz bike that keeps popping in

3113
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:29,599
is that router um

3114
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:31,760
i honestly don't know what that for and

3115
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,440
change gigahertz line

3116
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:37,199
we're seeing in this region is um

3117
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:38,719
and so on and so forth but you can

3118
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:40,560
imagine that if you were in a

3119
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:43,360
in an all at all clean rf environment

3120
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,560
and you were just

3121
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,840
you know knocking around your board with

3122
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,840
an airfield probe trying to find this

3123
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:48,800
stuff

3124
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:51,840
you will probably have a relatively easy

3125
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,760
time of it with the um

3126
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,760
with the hack rf and hack rf sweep

3127
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:56,800
enabled

3128
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,199
um and you can do this with the rtl sdr

3129
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:00,800
it's just a lot slower and less

3130
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:01,440
convenient

3131
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:04,080
so all sorts of options and i hope at

3132
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,040
this point you

3133
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:08,400
have basically just tuned me out and

3134
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,639
spent the last half an hour like

3135
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:12,560
fiddling around with your own boards and

3136
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:15,679
and um sniffing around for your own

3137
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:16,000
pleasure

3138
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,159
but i guess we don't have a ton of time

3139
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:19,280
left now but uh

3140
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:23,360
yeah i guess any any questions or

3141
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:26,480
or difficulties or like

3142
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:28,480
need help with anything before we knock

3143
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,760
out so they can use the room again

3144
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:33,280
i'll try to open up the chat and see if

3145
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,800
i can follow

3146
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:38,159
i have a one question yeah

3147
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:41,599
um i'm

3148
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:43,520
i'm doing basically the same thing i

3149
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,280
have a signaled

3150
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:47,280
spectrum analyzer but i think it's the

3151
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:48,719
same principle

3152
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:51,920
um have you have you had any uh

3153
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:54,880
experience with building your own listen

3154
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:55,440
or

3155
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:58,800
common mode probes no um

3156
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,840
and that is definitely like

3157
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:03,280
next thing on my list as far as

3158
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,040
compliance um

3159
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,520
interest so for background for anyone

3160
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:08,639
else who might not be familiar we've

3161
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:10,480
been covering radiated emissions

3162
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:13,760
primarily another seriously important

3163
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:14,800
aspect of

3164
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,719
um emissions testing is conducted

3165
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:17,840
emissions especially for stuff that

3166
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,040
plugs into a wall

3167
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,040
so the question is what kind of noise

3168
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,960
are we are we blasting out over the

3169
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,639
power supply into our device

3170
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:26,320
like back into the rest of a household

3171
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:27,760
or an office or whatever

3172
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:31,280
um the question is basically like

3173
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:32,880
have you tried building your own cheap

3174
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,800
hardware for doing those sorts of

3175
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:35,679
measurements which

3176
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:38,239
are among other things require a line

3177
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:40,080
impedance stabilization network and some

3178
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:41,119
other hardware

3179
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:43,360
um no i have not played around with

3180
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,960
building any of that myself

3181
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,480
in theory i believe the technique is

3182
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:48,239
completely applicable if you build your

3183
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:48,880
own

3184
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:51,920
um if you build your own listen and and

3185
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:53,440
filter hardware and all the rest of it

3186
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,360
you should well be able to conduct

3187
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,280
conducted emissions testing this same

3188
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:59,679
sort of way and you might even be able

3189
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:00,480
to get away

3190
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:03,760
with um doing like doing that from a

3191
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:04,960
pre-compliance standpoint because

3192
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,880
basically the

3193
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:09,119
the issue that we have here is we have

3194
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:11,040
no idea what the power into our device

3195
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,560
actually means like the

3196
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:15,760
lna isn't calibrated the um

3197
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:17,440
line losses are not calibrated the

3198
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,199
antennas are far from calibrated

3199
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:21,679
like none of this gives us an accurate

3200
01:54:21,679 --> 01:54:22,560
measurement

3201
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,239
on the other hand if you if you're

3202
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:26,639
building your own connected hardware and

3203
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:28,800
and leaving like diy antennas out of it

3204
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:29,920
and whatnot you can

3205
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,599
probably characterize all of that stuff

3206
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:33,520
reasonably well with a nano vna or

3207
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:34,560
something like that to the point where

3208
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:35,360
you can get

3209
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,440
an at least calibrated if not

3210
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,880
necessarily accurate

3211
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,119
uh measurement setup so if you're a

3212
01:54:41,119 --> 01:54:43,119
bunch of db down you know you're 10 db

3213
01:54:43,119 --> 01:54:43,760
below

3214
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,280
the limit or something like that you are

3215
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,199
pretty confident at that point it's good

3216
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:51,840
no i haven't tried it though okay

3217
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:55,360
yeah and i noticed that many of the

3218
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,440
commercial listens there are quite

3219
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:59,679
expensive and they can handle a lot of

3220
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:03,040
amps but i also found some online where

3221
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,000
you have a

3222
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:09,280
smd board that can handle up to 10 amps

3223
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,119
and fairly high frequency so i thought

3224
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:12,880
it was quite interesting

3225
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:15,199
yeah one thing that strikes me is true

3226
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:16,480
this day and age

3227
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:18,400
in engineering especially with rf stuff

3228
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:20,560
like this is

3229
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:23,360
stuff just doesn't cost that much to

3230
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:24,159
design

3231
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:26,480
anymore like like it doesn't cost that

3232
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:27,840
much to build i should say

3233
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,320
so if you want serious gear that does a

3234
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:31,119
good job

3235
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:33,360
that will cost you money like this this

3236
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:34,800
tech rsa

3237
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:37,360
its real claim to fame is that it's um

3238
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:39,280
its offset is basically negligible and

3239
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:40,480
very well calibrated

3240
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,480
when you move from one thing to the next

3241
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:43,760
thing to the next thing

3242
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:46,880
um like one chunk of spectrum and

3243
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:47,920
whatnot which is

3244
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:50,400
definitely not true of the sdr stuff

3245
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,119
like the

3246
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:53,360
the hack rf and the whatever you notice

3247
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:54,719
that the like noise floor of the hacker

3248
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:56,080
f doesn't look like it drifts around as

3249
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:58,239
it scans so it's like pretty good but

3250
01:55:58,239 --> 01:56:01,040
but the rt lsdr and whatnot the the

3251
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:02,960
noise floor may be different the

3252
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:05,040
gain may be different at different

3253
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,400
points in the frequency spectrum and all

3254
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:07,040
of that is

3255
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,080
going to kill you if you're trying to

3256
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:10,320
make like actual um

3257
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:11,840
pre-compliance like calibrated

3258
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,000
pre-compliance checks um which we avoid

3259
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,360
the need for entirely because we're just

3260
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,119
qualitatively looking for where stuff is

3261
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:18,159
coming from

3262
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:19,760
um so you probably run into that as a

3263
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,520
problem but anyway

3264
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:24,480
the real point of that statement is like

3265
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,000
you're paying for the effort that goes

3266
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:26,400
into

3267
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,679
making something that's flat and

3268
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:30,239
calibrated and predictable

3269
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:32,719
not something that meets the like

3270
01:56:32,719 --> 01:56:34,639
baseline

3271
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:37,119
like load requirements or that sort of

3272
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:38,239
thing like

3273
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:40,159
you can just get good components cheap

3274
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:41,599
these days

3275
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:45,440
and highly capable alex we appreciate it

3276
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,320
thank you for

3277
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:48,800
sharing with us that really fascinating

3278
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,560
and uh informative talk

3279
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:54,080
uh it was very clear and

3280
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:56,320
thank you for straightforward i don't

3281
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:58,960
believe you but thanks

3282
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:01,679
not at all um but i'd like to invite

3283
