1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,799
welcome everyone

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,559
to emoticon and uh depending on your

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,440
location

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,200
good morning good afternoon and good

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,639
evening and

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,520
uh today uh we'll be talking with eric

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,560
shuttler

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,840
um on pcb reverse engineering

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,519
and uh eric is a hardware hacker

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,560
kathy cathode ray tube aficionado

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,039
and enjoys both ford and reverse

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:31,840
engineering

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,800
uh he's known for his monster 6502

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,840
processor

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,200
microprocessor and his sound

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,239
or snark barker sound card

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,360
so with that uh i'd like to introduce uh

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,000
eric and oh if you have any questions or

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,559
comments

20
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,120
put them in into the sidebar in the chat

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,360
uh but most importantly you can unmute

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,600
and ask them the question directly so uh

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,760
eric uh we're on tv talk

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,600
all right welcome everybody uh thank you

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,040
so much for coming i've been looking

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
forward to this for quite some time

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
and i really hope you all enjoy it i've

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,360
been to one of the other workshop

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
sessions and one of the things that i

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,400
wanted to do

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,680
a little bit differently in this

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,080
workshop is i really want it to be

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,280
a hands-on situation and so i have some

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,799
slides and stuff prepared that i'll go

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,840
through to kind of give you an

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
introduction to the subject

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,920
but really what we want to do is dig in

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,280
to the circuit boards

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,600
that i hope you all brought and what

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,720
that means is that

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
you should be prepared to show me the

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,320
board on camera

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,040
and unmute yourself and ask me questions

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,159
if you're getting stuck at one

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,600
particular point when you're working

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,360
through the reverse engineering

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,720
i am here for you today and

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,840
so we'll have a lot of fun doing that so

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,159
let's go ahead and actually i've got

50
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,439
some questions coming in

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,960
about some of the computers behind me

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,560
those are some of the computers in my

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,600
vintage

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,520
collection so things that i reverse

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,880
engineer to fix

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,920
or things that i design hardware for

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,000
it's a really interesting way to sort of

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,759
practice my electronics hobby

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,639
so i guess we can talk about that later

60
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,480
if we have time anyway i'd like to

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,920
start by going through a short

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,440
presentation

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,200
this presentation is divided into two

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,879
halves and

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,560
so we'll do the first half we'll do a

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
little bit of hands-on type stuff

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,959
uh we'll take a break do the second half

68
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,720
and uh then do the second part of the

69
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,920
workshop

70
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,640
all right so let's go ahead and talk

71
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,760
about

72
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,280
reverse engineering circuit boards

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,879
so first of all i want to make sure that

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,040
you all brought a circuit board

75
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
and ideally you want something that is a

76
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,120
two layer board

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,800
and something that's reasonably

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
straightforward probably less than 100

79
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:48,959
parts

80
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,640
otherwise it just starts to get to be a

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,720
bit of a pain to do in two hours

82
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,160
uh if you have one that's more

83
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,319
complicated than that that's okay

84
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,080
just don't plan on finishing it in two

85
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,560
hours and if that's the case that's okay

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,159
you can always finish it up later

87
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,519
with the techniques that you'll learn

88
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,519
today so

89
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,879
a couple of tools that you're going to

90
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,280
need a flashlight will be very useful

91
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,480
for you

92
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,879
soldering tools are optional but

93
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,680
recommended

94
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,239
if you have trouble getting to a trace

95
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,920
you may need to remove a part so that

96
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,000
you can see underneath it

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
and then finally you'll need some

98
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,840
software uh for image editing i prefer

99
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,159
the

100
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,239
open source but if you have

101
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,080
photoshop you could use that too

102
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,840
i will not tell you how to use photoshop

103
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
because i don't know how

104
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,760
and so my demo here will be focused on

105
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,480


106
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,799
and then for the schematic capture we're

107
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
going to be using kicad

108
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,159
i guess you could use eagle whatever

109
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,920
you're comfortable with but the demo is

110
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,080
all done in kai-cad

111
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,040
are you all ready everybody's ready of

112
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
course they're ready

113
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
all right so i want to talk about the

114
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,799
two basic kinds of pcb reverse

115
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,400
engineering

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,720
the first kind is what i call a block

117
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,560
diagram slash bomb level or bill of

118
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,159
materials level

119
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,879
and when you pay a professional company

120
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,200
to reverse engineer a piece of hardware

121
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,879
typically this is what they'll give you

122
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,879
so they'll give you a nice fancy report

123
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,640
with a bunch of images and stuff like

124
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,959
that and a parts list

125
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,120
usually fairly detailed although a lot

126
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,880
of the jelly bean parts they uh they'll

127
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,079
just leave out

128
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,519
and the idea here is that you can kind

129
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,279
of get a general idea

130
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,280
of how the product is constructed how

131
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,639
the board works

132
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,680
what are the big basic blocks inside

133
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,000
that

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,960
design now the second kind of pcb

135
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,000
reverse engineering

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360
is a detailed clone and that's where you

137
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
go in and you back out the entire

138
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,320
schematic

139
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,960
and potentially even the pcb and so

140
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,000
that's what i did with the snark

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,479
barker circuit board i started with the

142
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,160
sound blaster sound card

143
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,759
and then reverse engineered it to get

144
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,919
the schematic and then back engineered

145
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,520
the layout as well

146
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,759
so i wanted to show you a quick example

147
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,600
of what it looks like to do a block

148
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,160
diagram

149
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,720
level reverse engineering so this is a

150
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,840
device called a

151
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,240
whistle pet tracker a whole pile of

152
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,840
these wound up at the local surplus

153
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,280
store and i bought one because it was

154
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,320
really cheap

155
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,600
and i was kind of curious to see what

156
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,919
was inside it and so what i did is i

157
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,360
took some pictures of the board and kind

158
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,960
of went through and identified as many

159
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,639
components as i could

160
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,800
and so you might see something like this

161
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,639
in a maybe slightly less than

162
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,080
professional report

163
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
and so you can see that there are some

164
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
major items here like there's this rf

165
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
microcontroller there's an accelerometer

166
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
i've taken the liberty of pointing out a

167
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,080
couple of the other components like

168
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,160
there's a diode and some other parts

169
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,000
but i don't have any connectivity

170
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,840
information in other words there's no

171
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,639
netlist

172
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,600
there's no schematic all i know is what

173
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,880
parts are on the board

174
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,639
and i can still learn quite a bit from

175
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,000
how this device

176
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,199
works just by understanding what devices

177
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,759
are on the circuit board if you flip the

178
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,120
board over there's a couple of other

179
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
interesting parts

180
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,720
too so there's actually an soc and some

181
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,840
crystals

182
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,520
and some flash memory and so you kind of

183
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,280
get a general feel

184
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
for what's in there in fact there's even

185
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
a oh somebody wants my picture in the

186
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,199
top right

187
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,639
there how's that is that better

188
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,280
okay so where was i oh yes and uh you

189
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,880
might also notice that this particular

190
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,840
device has the

191
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,159
infamous chinese smite spy chip as well

192
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,360
okay and

193
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,240
this is a different device this is a

194
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,319
snappy video snapshot

195
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,240
and what i've done here is put together

196
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
a block diagram with a schematic

197
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,880
underneath it

198
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,960
and so this is the result of a couple of

199
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
hours of reverse engineering work

200
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,400
on that board and uh so this

201
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,759
if you don't know what a snappy video

202
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,720
snapshot was back in the 90s

203
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,880
all you had was a parallel port to

204
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,639
connect peripherals to your computer

205
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,720
parallel port or serial port there was

206
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,479
no usb at that point

207
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,919
and so if you wanted to do something

208
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,520
like oh i don't know digitize

209
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,080
analog video then you would have to buy

210
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,800
this little

211
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,720
video snapshot which would plug into the

212
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,080
parallel port

213
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,599
and that would uh acquire the signal and

214
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,080
then

215
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
the software would actually turn that

216
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,360
into a video image

217
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,039
and so it's a very clever design using

218
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,800
an fpga and some other stuff

219
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,319
uh if you don't know what i'm talking

220
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,840
about with parallel ports then you're

221
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,120
just gonna have to look at this meme

222
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,800
okay moving on to the

223
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,000
start of the reverse engineering effort

224
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,759
first thing that you need to do is put

225
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,360
together a list

226
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,319
of all the components on the circuit

227
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,520
board

228
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
and there's a particular way of doing it

229
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,720
that i like doing it

230
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,560
you can do whatever way you want but the

231
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,360
basic information that you'll need

232
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,440
is the component designator so hopefully

233
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,039
your circuit board has a silk screen

234
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,240
markings on it

235
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,919
that show you what the designator is

236
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,639
and you also need the package type and

237
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,319
so you look at the part

238
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,960
and you can use experience you can use

239
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,599
google

240
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,199
there are some guides that you can find

241
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,520
online on various surface mount part

242
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,680
package types and as best as you can

243
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,599
identify what that is and then type that

244
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,879
in

245
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,919
somebody actually had one of those

246
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,319
snappy gadgets that's great i like that

247
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,759
and of course it won't work with modern

248
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,400
os because yeah reasons uh

249
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,039
and you also want to store the marking

250
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,960
information so look at the top of

251
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,280
the chip for example and anything that's

252
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,720
on there anything at all

253
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,120
just type that up into a cell in that

254
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,000
spreadsheet

255
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,440
and so you can see i have an example

256
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,919
here started where there's a transistor

257
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,400
and a

258
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,919
23 package with the k1n marking and here

259
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,440
i have not identified

260
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,399
what that part number is and that's okay

261
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,440
that may be okay

262
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,200
for the reverse engineering effort

263
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,559
you're doing it may be enough to

264
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,519
understand

265
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,679
how the board works and then some of the

266
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,279
others you could see i've filled in

267
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,360
part numbers and various other pieces of

268
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,000
information

269
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,240
okay so here's another example

270
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,800
this looks like a transistor the

271
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,600
designator

272
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,880
is a t1 t for transistor

273
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,279
typically q is more common but i've also

274
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,800
seen t

275
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,360
the part here is a saat23 and i just

276
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,279
happen to know that from experience

277
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,040
but like i said before you can actually

278
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,120
google part

279
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,920
package types and you can get a visual

280
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,440
reference guide to see

281
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,040
what each of those different packages

282
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,080
look like and that can be very helpful

283
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
then you can also see that there's a top

284
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
mark on here it's one 3g

285
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,160
and so often what you can do is search

286
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,000
google for

287
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,200
quote 13 g unquote and then the name of

288
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,399
the package

289
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,920
and you'll start getting parts just

290
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
coming in that might be possible

291
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,279
candidates

292
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,880
now obviously if it's not a transistor

293
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,640
then you can discard it you kind of want

294
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,080
to filter just by parts that are

295
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,760
transistors in this case

296
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,200
and then eventually if you're lucky

297
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,240
you'll even find a part number for it

298
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,720
okay

299
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,519
now you might notice depending on your

300
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,880
board that

301
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,279
there may be components with no markings

302
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,080
at all

303
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,200
a common example are most surface mount

304
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,480
ceramic capacitors have no marks on them

305
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,720
what you can do for that is desolder it

306
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
and then measure the capacitance with a

307
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,360
multimeter

308
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,680
that has a capacitance checker mode or

309
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
you might have a fancier lcr meter that

310
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,040
you can use to get a more accurate

311
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,959
reading so anyway you could take that

312
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,240
take that value that goes in the

313
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,760
spreadsheet

314
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,680
resistors a lot of them do have marks on

315
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
them those really small ones do not and

316
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,040
you'll have to take those out

317
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,200
of the circuit and measure them with a

318
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,720
multimeter

319
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,480
now if you don't know what it is you

320
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,000
don't want to have to remove it from the

321
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,880
board

322
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,200
you may you you might be able to figure

323
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,160
it out so

324
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,880
a lot of component data sheets uh for

325
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,079
chips that are

326
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,600
you know that require a lot of external

327
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
circuitry they will give you a typical

328
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,320
application

329
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,880
circuit and that circuit will often have

330
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
recommended component values in there

331
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,600
and so by looking to see which pins

332
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,440
those discrete components connect to you

333
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,040
can often figure out

334
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,560
what the probable value is of the part

335
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,480
and so when you're done with all of that

336
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,760
then you can put together a block

337
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,519
diagram but

338
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,880
for that let's go ahead and launch into

339
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,040
the practical part of the

340
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,200
presentation so i'm gonna go ahead and

341
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,760
switch my views

342
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,200
and uh we're gonna look at the board

343
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,360
that i am going to reverse engineer

344
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,079
today so yes i am going to be reverse

345
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,600
engineering a circuit board with you too

346
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,399
um hold on let me go and manage some

347
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,279
slides here real quick

348
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,880
um give me one sec

349
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800
okay so i hope you all have your boards

350
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,320
with you

351
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,839
uh let me go and switch my cameras

352
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,040
around a little bit so you can see me

353
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,600
still

354
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,920
uh so this is my circuit board uh i

355
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,839
actually did bring some high resolution

356
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,360
photos but they're in my backup slide

357
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,480
section so i am managing that right now

358
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,360
uh here we go let me go back to this

359
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,760
view

360
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,279
all right this is much better i

361
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
apologize for the other camera

362
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,440
it's the only other camera i own and

363
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,639
it's ntsc

364
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,320
so i'm calling it the potato cam 2000

365
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,760
all right so this is the circuit board

366
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,320
that i brought this i found in my junk

367
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
box i'm not really sure what it is

368
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,079
you can see it's a mix of through-hole

369
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,120
components and surface mount components

370
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,680
and uh so there's some there's one chip

371
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,120
here it looks like something that could

372
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,720
be a voltage regulator

373
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,399
uh up here and it's also got some wires

374
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,120
coming in

375
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,720
i may have to move those out of the way

376
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,000
so i can see what some of the other

377
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,079
components underneath it might be

378
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,839
it seems like it's uh pretty well

379
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,760
labeled on here

380
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,079
so we're going to move into the hands-on

381
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,440
part of

382
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,839
the workshop where you bring out your

383
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,800
circuit board

384
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,639
and start putting together the bill of

385
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,000
materials

386
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,680
so i'm going to go and see if i can

387
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
share that with you

388
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,959
uh let's go and get that out of the way

389
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,959
i'm gonna go ahead and fire up uh

390
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,839
libreoffice

391
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,880
because we got to be all open source

392
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,959
software here

393
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,720
and so let's do designator

394
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
and by the way you can sort of stop

395
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,079
watching me at this point

396
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,160
and start watching your board because

397
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,519
what i'm going to do is go through this

398
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,480
entire board

399
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,160
and i'm going to type up every component

400
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,639
that's on here and so

401
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,200
at your end of things i want you to

402
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,160
bring up a spreadsheet

403
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,920
start doing that with yours too now if

404
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,519
you have any questions

405
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,519
you can ping me in the chat and so

406
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,120
hopefully i'll look over periodically

407
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,240
i'll be able to see that

408
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,680
and then answer any questions that you

409
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,240
might have if there's a component on any

410
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,639
of

411
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,000
the circuit board that you're that

412
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,199
you're trying to reverse engineering you

413
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,880
just don't know what it is

414
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,680
then please share it with the rest of us

415
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,079
so

416
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,920
go ahead and unmute your microphone turn

417
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,839
on your video and show us the board and

418
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,839
i'll do my best to try and identify it

419
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,320
and if i can't then perhaps somebody

420
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,959
else

421
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,360
in the room can actually do that

422
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,120
somebody's got a nixie driver board it

423
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
has chips with cyrillic writing and date

424
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,880
codes of 83

425
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,480
that would be a wonderful board to look

426
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,320
at sebastian if you don't mind

427
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:17,839
go ahead and show us that on your video

428
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,199
let me see if there's something i have

429
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,920
to do here you should be able to do that

430
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,360
yeah if you don't feel comfortable

431
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,199
sharing or uh turning your camera on or

432
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,560
anything like that that's absolutely

433
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,839
fine don't worry about it

434
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,440
yeah so some of those uh russian chips

435
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
can be very interesting

436
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
the hardest part is figuring out the

437
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,279
characters to type into google but it

438
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,880
often does work uh someone else has a

439
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,079
board that they have the bill of

440
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,680
material for and solder together myself

441
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,279
hope i'm not cheating too much

442
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,079
i think that'll be okay high voltage

443
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,760
binary decoder yeah there's a

444
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,360
nixie tube driver that's pretty well

445
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,399
known that uh

446
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
uh we'll be using okay so designator i'm

447
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
not putting in quantity i'm putting in

448
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,040
package type i'm going to put in pop

449
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,399
mark

450
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,839
and part number

451
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,680
okay so let's have a look at my board

452
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,440
now

453
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,279
uh c1 there's a good start

454
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,800
i should probably start with a chip

455
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,000
though first all right let's do u1

456
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,720
the package is uh dip i think this is a

457
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,639
14 pin

458
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,440
seven yeah that's a 14 pin dip and the

459
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,560
top mark is

460
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,079
mc 1374p

461
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,560
and then on the second line it says khal

462
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,279
9311 that's probably the date code so

463
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,680
i imagine that's the 11th week of 1993.

464
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,480
so either that or the 93rd week of 1911

465
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:56,800
but

466
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,240
you guessed as to which one is more

467
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,639
likely

468
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,240
and then the part number is well

469
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,399
obviously that's going to be the mc1374

470
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,079
and this is also where google comes in

471
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,560
handy and so what i can do is actually

472
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,000
figure out

473
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,880
what that part number is and see

474
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,480
what did i say it was 1374.

475
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,240
no one's commented on my search history

476
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,120
so that's good this is a tv modulator

477
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,720
circuit

478
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,199
oh that's interesting that's a really

479
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,800
interesting looking part

480
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
yeah somebody else already looked it up

481
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,839
looks like

482
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,440
yeah blind views i wouldn't recommend

483
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,800
doing a board with blind vias it's

484
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,759
starting to get a little too complicated

485
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,600
uh someone on youtube asks why do you

486
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,040
need to take the components out of the

487
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,880
circuit to measure them i.e resistors

488
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,320
couldn't this be determined in the

489
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,240
circuit with a voltmeter

490
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,360
well the answer is you can try

491
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,199
the problem is is that there are often

492
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,440
other components in the circuit

493
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,680
that will throw off your reading so for

494
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,440
example let's say you have two resistors

495
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,880
and they're wired in parallel on the

496
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,079
circuit board

497
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,759
if i come in with my multimeter and i

498
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,359
try to measure the resistance

499
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,000
of one of those resistors the value that

500
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,720
i'm reading is

501
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,199
actually the resistance of those two

502
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,000
resistors

503
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,640
in parallel and so other elements in the

504
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,280
circuit

505
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,599
will influence the reading now the same

506
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,359
thing goes for capacitors trying to do

507
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,319
it in circuit

508
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,839
you're just not going to get an accurate

509
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,159
reading

510
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,599
uh yeah so unfortunately the screen is a

511
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,559
little blurry

512
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,840
uh trying to think if i can

513
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,880
well i have an idea let me try something

514
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,600
bear with me

515
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,679
one minute okay so i'm going to do a

516
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,200
zoom screen share instead

517
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,799
and we'll give that a shot and see if

518
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,039
that works any better

519
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,960
so please let me know what that looks

520
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,360
like that looks that good

521
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,000
much better

522
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,240
okay so tv modulator circuit

523
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,960
the mc1374 includes an fm audio

524
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,280
modulator sound carrier rf oscillator

525
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,160
and rf

526
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,640
dual input modulator okay that's

527
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,919
informative

528
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,320
oh it generates a tv signal from audio

529
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,919
and video inputs

530
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,600
okay this board is actually a lot more

531
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,120
useful than i thought it would be

532
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,039
i had it in my junk box but as it turns

533
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,039
out i might be able to use it to

534
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,400
act as an rf modulator for some of my my

535
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,720
vintage game consoles and computers so i

536
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,559
can hook it up to a vintage

537
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,520
rf input television so now i have a good

538
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,840
reason to go and reverse engineer it

539
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,919
and look at this simplified application

540
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,559
and so here they have a circuit diagram

541
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,320
with some component values in here and

542
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,160
so if i can't figure out any of the

543
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,360
parts

544
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,120
or the part values i can refer to this

545
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,640
diagram in the data sheet to kind of

546
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,440
figure out

547
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,240
what they recommend i put in so i'm

548
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,760
going to go ahead and go back

549
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,080
and just start entering more of these

550
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,160
parts as i find them

551
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,440
so here's u2 uh this one

552
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,559
is looks like somebody's pinging me hold

553
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,880
on one sec

554
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,000
i have a saw 23 package with markings e

555
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,880
h ideas okay i would recommend you

556
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,160
google for

557
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,320
uh quote eh and then sat 23

558
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,720
and then if you have the designator if

559
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,640
the designator begins with a q

560
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,559
then it's probably a transistor if it

561
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,240
begins with u

562
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,520
then it's probably

563
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,360
okay somebody was just pinging me what

564
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,840
the video quality looks like okay good

565
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,600
that's solved

566
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,440
uh and if it's a u that means it's a

567
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,039
chip

568
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,280
okay i'm gonna go ahead and go back here

569
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,919
this is a to220 i hope that answers your

570
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,640
question

571
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,919
by the way if you want to ask me a

572
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,160
question over audio please feel free

573
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,039
i want this to be an interactive okay so

574
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,360
this is uh

575
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,240
7808 i'm sure you can guess what this is

576
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,120
ct oh there's an mc at the beginning

577
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,080
oops

578
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,120
did not want to do that i did have one

579
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,600
question

580
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,799
um how do you tell the difference

581
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,520
um numbers on a package how what how do

582
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,600
you narrow down okay this is a date code

583
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,679
this is probably a part number because

584
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,880
some chips i see that

585
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,679
i don't know what's what yeah yeah that

586
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,799
can be hard sometimes

587
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,520
uh google is kind of your best bet so if

588
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,120
there are multiple lines of text

589
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,760
then put in both lines separately with

590
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
quote marks around them

591
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,880
and so if one of them doesn't really

592
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,640
turn up any results google will often

593
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,039
automatically drop that now you can also

594
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,760
experiment

595
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,280
and so you could search for one line

596
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,799
versus the other line

597
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,799
you can also truncate the part number so

598
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,480
if it's got letters at the end you can

599
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,840
get rid of those and just search for the

600
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,799
first

601
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,600
couple of letters and numbers date codes

602
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,480
in general

603
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,919
are in the form factor where they'll

604
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,039
have a a two-digit year and a two-digit

605
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,480
uh week number and that's basically the

606
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,880
the number of the week in the year so uh

607
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,640
january first would be week number one

608
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
and so on and so forth

609
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,360
and so if that number is greater than 52

610
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,760
then

611
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,320
it's probably not the weak number and

612
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,120
conversely

613
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,440
if the your digit number the two-digit

614
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,960
number doesn't make sense

615
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,080
so if it says like 33 possibly referring

616
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,559
to 1933 they didn't make chips then and

617
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,159
so obviously that's not really going to

618
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:18,720
be

619
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,840
what it is now other manufacturers will

620
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,760
use different coding schemes and so this

621
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
is just the most common one that i'm

622
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,960
telling you about

623
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,600
so on this one right here khl9311 the

624
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,799
first

625
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,520
four letters they're probably for the

626
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,960
fab that they were using so

627
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,720
it could be like a fab and assembly lot

628
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,799
number and then the last couple of

629
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,679
digits are the

630
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,840
date code but not everyone does it that

631
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,240
way

632
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,080
okay so this one right here for example

633
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
this 7808

634
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,760
it just says qhl317 and uh so that's

635
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,720
going to be in their

636
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
uh form factor i don't know exactly what

637
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,280
that code means so that seems like some

638
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,840
specific motorola thing so i'm just

639
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,120
going to leave that off for now because

640
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,159
i already know that

641
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,960
what this part is is a lm7808 which is

642
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,280
the

643
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,720
eight volt version of a 7805 yeah that's

644
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,200
also handy so somebody pasted a link

645
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,679
to an smd code book and that's going to

646
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,520
be very very useful to refer to and

647
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,280
somebody else somebody else already said

648
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,679
that it's an 8 volt regulator

649
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,360
i don't even do any work you guys can do

650
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,039
it all except you have your own boards

651
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,320
and i hope you're doing the same thing

652
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,840
on your board

653
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,200
okay so let's get some of these other

654
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,520
parts in here so those are the two

655
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,200
chips i wanted to do those major

656
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
components first and so i'm just going

657
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,919
to go and blast

658
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,919
through here if your board doesn't have

659
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,120
a designator

660
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,960
then what i recommend you do is go on to

661
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,039
the next step of the process where you

662
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,520
take a nice high resolution photo

663
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,159
of the top and the bottom of the board

664
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:46,799
and

665
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,320
you don't have to use a really fancy

666
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,760
camera for that you can just use your

667
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
cell phone if it's got a decent camera

668
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,080
on it

669
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,000
if you have a scanner then you can put

670
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,760
it in the scanner and use that to

671
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,640
get a high resolution image now that's

672
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,679
important

673
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,039
for when your board doesn't have a

674
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,720
designator because

675
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,480
then you can pull that image into

676
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,120
and you can superimpose your own

677
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
designator on top of it

678
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,200
and then put that into your spreadsheet

679
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,440
so you'll know what you're referring to

680
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,960
now if you do it that way i recommend

681
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,720
that you add that as a separate layer

682
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,559
and so that layer will hold all of those

683
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,760
text elements

684
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,640
okay let's go ahead and get these added

685
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,760
here

686
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,480
c1 r1 r9 and r5

687
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,559
so c1 obviously i don't know what it is

688
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,159
because i haven't measured it and

689
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,640
there's no marking on top

690
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,880
r1 is uh 273

691
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,159
and so i'm going to enter that in here

692
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,840
273. that's actually uh 27 kiloohms

693
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,240
uh because what they do is it's it's

694
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,000
kind of like resistor color code on a

695
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,640
standard

696
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,440
uh colorful resistor it's just that

697
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,799
instead of colors they just put the

698
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,240
number on there and so the first two

699
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,360
digits

700
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,679
are the the value and then the last one

701
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,760
is the number of zeros

702
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,880
at the end okay so r9

703
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,000
is 393. i also look at it upside down

704
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,360
because sometimes

705
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,640
they make sense both ways but this one

706
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:18,960
is

707
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,159
uh 39k so that's good

708
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,720
r9 let's do 39k

709
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,720
sometimes designators are one to one

710
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,000
from the example diagram in the

711
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
datasheet app note yes that's an

712
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,720
excellent point that's another good

713
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,600
trick

714
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,440
see i i knew this would be good as an

715
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,640
interactive

716
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,799
workshop because people here have so

717
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,720
many awesome tips to offer

718
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,600
this is great this is really good i'm

719
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,720
definitely going to be learning things

720
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,799
here today too

721
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,880
or yes go ahead oh sorry would you be

722
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,840
able to reflash

723
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,039
the board that you're uh uh reverse

724
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,720
engineering there's some people who

725
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,200
just jumped in and are curious about

726
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,279
what exactly you're looking at again

727
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,400
yeah yeah so um i can actually move

728
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,880
my slide presentation back over here

729
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,480
again

730
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,360
uh shoot there we go okay so this is the

731
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,480
board

732
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,120
uh it's called on command video and i'm

733
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,400
starting to remember where i got this

734
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,559
from i pulled this off of the back

735
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,120
of a really weird uh two-thirds form

736
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,840
factor

737
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,919
vhs vcr that was designed to run off of

738
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,600
12 volts dc

739
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,279
and i think it came out as some sort of

740
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,440
a video on demand service where you'd

741
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,360
like dial in some number or something

742
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,039
and then it would automatically play the

743
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,120
tape that was loaded into the player

744
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,880
and so this is the video interface board

745
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,080
that i pulled off the back

746
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,960
great suggestion okay where was i

747
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,000
that's r5 yes go ahead uh

748
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,720
i have a suggestion for a part that i

749
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,760
actually can't

750
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,640
find but okay as i said i do have the

751
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,000
bomb so i can't i

752
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,559
can find it if there if you want but it

753
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,919
says 7bd

754
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,520
841 84 y that's an

755
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,720
eight pin package very small one okay

756
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,799
so do you have a picture of the package

757
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,400
or do you have video of the package

758
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,919
there's a number of different types of

759
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,520
trying to give you the

760
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,600
that's the tiny little black square

761
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,400
there okay

762
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,760
all right hang on the video

763
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,880
can you see the hold on one sec

764
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,640
hold on one sec i'm trying to find your

765
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,039
video

766
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,919
i'm a little new to the whole zoom thing

767
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,600
so i'm having a

768
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,840
label other abbey

769
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,480
give me one sec sorry yep yep

770
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,080
it was quite a small package um

771
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,320
how do i bring somebody how do i bring

772
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,279
somebody's video into focus

773
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,200
um oh wait there we go

774
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,640
uh this one here we go

775
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,840
okay yeah so yeah

776
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,799
yeah so it's got eight pins

777
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,840
huh that is a little bit odd that i

778
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,880
would say is a

779
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,000
dfn uh does it have leads on

780
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,960
all four sides or just two sides two

781
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,000
sides

782
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,559
two sides yeah that's probably a dfn one

783
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,080
of the other tricks that you can do is

784
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
if you have a ruler calibrated in

785
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,880
millimeters

786
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,320
or a set of calipers a pardon me that's

787
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,720
my

788
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,520
clock uh striking the hour if you can

789
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,640
hear that

790
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,159
but what you can do is actually measure

791
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,480
the dimensions the x and y dimensions of

792
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,600
the chip

793
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,159
and if it might be something like three

794
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,919
by three millimeters in which case now

795
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,000
you know it's a three by three dfn

796
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,880
package

797
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,080
yeah it's three by two point nine okay

798
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,480
excellent so call it a three by three

799
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,000
and so what you would do then is search

800
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,799
for

801
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,840
uh 3x3

802
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,320
and then put in what that top mark was

803
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,080
and uh that should help you track it

804
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,840
down

805
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,360
efn you said yeah 3x3

806
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,640
dfn right

807
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,120
and then just plug in the top mark and

808
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,440
you should start seeing results

809
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,120
uh now they may not be exactly what for

810
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,799
what that part is

811
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,320
one of the hints that you might get is

812
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,039
to look at the circuitry around it

813
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,039
for example if it's near a usb connector

814
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,039
it might be some kind of a usb surge

815
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,559
protection device

816
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,600
i'm pretty sure it's actually a voltage

817
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,200
regulator

818
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,960
oh yeah voltage regulator that's a good

819
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,559
one yeah

820
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,320
so you can also add those keywords so if

821
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,000
you have guesses as to what it might be

822
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,159
you can add those to the search terms

823
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,919
and try and narrow things down it's

824
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,440
it's a little bit of an art and it takes

825
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,120
some practice but

826
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,080
i think you'll find that uh that it gets

827
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,720
easier

828
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,840
with uh with time

829
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,360
okay so i'm going to go ahead and figure

830
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,840
out some of these other resistors here

831
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,240
so this looks like this is 180 k

832
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,200
i can pipe correctly r12 is

833
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,039
2k yeah these are all very large

834
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,640
resistors and so i'm not expecting

835
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
anything out of the

836
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
e12 series which would be like a five

837
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,000
percent resistor

838
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,520
okay so here's an inductor l3

839
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
and it says 120 on it so i'm going to

840
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,720
put that under top mark

841
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,880
inductors are tricky because the

842
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,559
manufacturers label them in different

843
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,279
ways

844
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,720
so for example 120 could mean 120

845
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,080
nanohenries

846
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,159
it could mean 12 nano henries in other

847
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,200
words one two with no zeros after it

848
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,399
it could mean 12 micro henries

849
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,799
i don't know and so i'm just going to

850
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,480
leave that alone for now until i have a

851
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,399
better idea of what it should be

852
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,840
now i could also go and refer back to

853
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,000
the data sheet and the data sheet

854
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,480
might give me an idea of the range of

855
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,200
values

856
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,480
that would be acceptable for that

857
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,960
component

858
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,000
i'm going to take a look and see if

859
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
there are any other comments here yeah s

860
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,120
manuals.com

861
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,559
smd that one's a really good one

862
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,000
mystery transformers will have some

863
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,919
windings with zero ohm resistance so you

864
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,720
can identify which winding is which

865
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
yeah identifying transformers can be

866
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,760
very very tricky

867
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,279
and that's kind of a whole separate ball

868
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,360
of wax i could i could do an hour-long

869
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,320
talk

870
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,520
just on transformers so let me go ahead

871
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,799
and go back here

872
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,440
let's finish this up c7

873
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,320
uh q3 actually let me do c3

874
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,480
that is that has a marking on it that

875
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,120
says 334

876
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,080
and that is 0.33 microfarads

877
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,480
and again i'm just looking at the

878
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,240
physical package it looks like a

879
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,440
dipped ceramic capacitor so experience

880
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,559
does help a lot

881
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,000
and if you don't have the experience

882
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
then you can google around and try and

883
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,799
figure it out or

884
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,158
desolder and measure it 47 mic 16 volts

885
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,360
yeah so there's some good diagrams that

886
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,120
you can look at that have logos of

887
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,960
semiconductor manufacturers

888
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,600
and that can also be useful if your chip

889
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,880
has a logo on it that you don't

890
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,000
recognize

891
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,120
and you want to be able to look it up on

892
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,919
the manufacturer's website

893
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,600
the flashlight is good because the

894
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,039
lighting at the front of my desk isn't

895
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,880
the best

896
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,200
uh 325 that doesn't sound like the

897
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
capacitor value let me look at the other

898
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,039
side okay three three four so that's

899
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:41,519
0.33 so that's another 0.33 microfarad

900
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,480
okay other labels include 63 wg4 and

901
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,320
c5h4 yeah it's hard to say

902
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,080
it could be a lot of different things a

903
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,880
48-pin qfp

904
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,080
ti labeled c2025

905
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,600
that may be difficult it might be a

906
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,960
custom ti part uh that's that's a tricky

907
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,919
one

908
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,679
anybody here used to work for ti maybe

909
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,240
you can look it up

910
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,480
and i have a question yeah go ahead yeah

911
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,679
so i have a board with two unlabeled ics

912
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,279
i can all right let me go and

913
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,880
i can find what's your name so i can

914
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,960
find you in the list uh inna

915
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,000
i n n e n n

916
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,320
e this is not in alphabetical order

917
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,919
ah thank you thank you

918
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,240
do you have feedback on my microphone or

919
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,200
uh

920
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,799
uh yeah let me go and see if i can see

921
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,320
it on the list

922
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,679
i'm just going to mention if you're

923
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,480
there near the top

924
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,200
yeah there you go ah look at that okay

925
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,559
so you have

926
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,440
an eight pin soic that's the u2 in the

927
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
middle

928
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,559
i see yeah and q1 right there next to it

929
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,559
that is a transistor

930
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,559
uh q is stands for transistor on the

931
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,679
designator

932
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,600
and it looks like it's not 23. it's a

933
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,960
little hard to tell from here with that

934
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,159
camera

935
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,120
and then on the left-hand view uh that

936
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,519
is also an eight pin stop23 and i can't

937
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,120
read the designator

938
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,440
that might also be oh is it l

939
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,480
uh which one sorry

940
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,440
so i'm looking at the left hand of the

941
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,519
image that you're showing

942
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,840
and that device directly above the

943
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,559
crystal

944
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,320
looks like an eight pin uh soic

945
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,480
yeah can't read the designator that's

946
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,159
next to it on the left

947
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,360
then you uh you um you won okay

948
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,120
all right you have two chips then and

949
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,360
then they're both in the same package

950
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,760
yeah so i have a tip one of those you

951
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,159
too

952
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,200
that actually might be a transistor

953
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,559
so just keep that in mind as you're

954
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,080
searching around they may have actually

955
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,519
labeled the transistor as

956
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,320
as a you instead of a queue so it does

957
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,000
happen sometimes

958
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,120
yeah so it's a a

959
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,880
remote controlled haptech feedback

960
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,399
device

961
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,679
so i think one of them should be a uh rf

962
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,119
receiver and the other one should be a

963
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,399
motor driver

964
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,320
that's a good guess so the right one

965
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,159
is connected directly to like the

966
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,839
battery and the

967
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,359
uh uh

968
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,399
motor uh-huh so

969
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,719
um

970
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,399
but like then they're not marked with

971
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,239
anything so should i just

972
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,959
guess go for

973
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,320
uh one of the things that will happen

974
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,800
that will happen in uh

975
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,399
uh well i haven't decided exactly when

976
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,599
we'll do this but at some point we'll

977
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,960
switch modes

978
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,119
and uh we'll start talking about imaging

979
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,079
the board

980
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,560
and then starting to trace over it uh

981
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,079
now the board that you have you might

982
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,119
actually have to

983
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,000
desolder those and uh you could do it

984
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,760
with a soldering iron but if you have

985
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,880
a heat gun that would be even easier

986
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,200
and so you can just pop that right off

987
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,640
if you can't do either of those that's

988
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,000
okay we can just try and guess

989
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,359
the connections and i'll kind of show

990
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,040
you a couple of techniques for doing

991
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,599
that

992
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,040
somebody else has an soc with no top

993
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,680
mark

994
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,960
in a really simple rgb led lamp is it

995
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,560
likely an 80 tiny

996
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,079
you know it's hard to say it could be

997
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,320
anything a lot of stuff that comes out

998
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,839
of china particularly the high volume

999
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,119
electronics

1000
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,640
they won't put labels on any of the

1001
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,079
chips because they're trying to prevent

1002
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,079
competitors from reverse engineering

1003
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,560
it so my guess is that it's an led

1004
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,599
driver chip

1005
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,160
that's a special purpose and so it may

1006
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,839
not be a microcontroller

1007
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,160
but again it's hard to say unless you

1008
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,359
have the whole board and you're looking

1009
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,880
at the whole board to figure out

1010
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,800
what other components are on there so

1011
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,400
for example if the board already has

1012
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,920
something that you know

1013
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,040
is an led driver then it

1014
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,720
very well may be a microcontroller it

1015
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,560
may be something else

1016
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,400
i hope that answers your question yeah

1017
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,320
clive.com has some excellent tear down

1018
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,359
videos and so

1019
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,960
you could also watch those to gain some

1020
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,480
more experience identifying some of

1021
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,160
these chips

1022
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,760
all right so let me go ahead and enter a

1023
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,440
couple more of these i may not get to

1024
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,680
all of them because i do want to move on

1025
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,440
at some point and start talking about

1026
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,119
how to actually image

1027
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,920
the uh device and uh and then start

1028
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,400
tracing it

1029
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,839
here which is coming okay go ahead

1030
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,320
so i have on my board a couple of uh

1031
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,240
connections that aren't bridged

1032
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,440
they have like shorter uh bubbles on

1033
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,240
them

1034
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,520
ah those are great yeah yeah so you've

1035
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,440
got two component pads

1036
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,920
but it's got a solder bubble on it that

1037
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,680
basically it's like a jumper and so

1038
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,280
that's a manufacturer's option a

1039
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,800
manufacturer's decided

1040
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,400
that they want to jumper the board a

1041
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
particular way

1042
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,760
and so either they'll put in a 0 ohm

1043
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
resistor or they'll put in a solder

1044
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,800
jumper

1045
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,320
and you can actually model that in your

1046
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
schematic and so you can drop down a

1047
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,240
jumper that's already got a wire across

1048
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,920
it and then figure out what it does

1049
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,000
later and so hopefully you can

1050
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,160
trace those connections but they're not

1051
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,760
jumped so they're not connected to each

1052
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,480
other

1053
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,960
ah okay so there's a secret function in

1054
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,599
there

1055
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,880
it might be fun to jump in and see what

1056
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,200
it does at some point

1057
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,079
okay r1an alright so i'm going back i

1058
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,359
have a transistor

1059
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,320
and i think that's an r1an but that

1060
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
might not be the number one it could be

1061
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,119
an uppercase

1062
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,079
i or a lowercase l and so if i go and

1063
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,359
google that then i'm going to have to

1064
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,200
figure out

1065
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,880
a couple of different options here and

1066
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,119
this also looks like a saat23 it's

1067
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,560
slightly larger than that

1068
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,160
and so it might be some manufacturer

1069
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,079
variants that's okay

1070
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,680
i'll leave that alone for now so here's

1071
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,240
c13

1072
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,000
c13 is a

1073
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,960
trimmer cap and i don't know anything

1074
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
about it i'll probably have to desolder

1075
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,440
it to

1076
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
figure out any of the characteristics it

1077
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,880
has a part number on it but there's a

1078
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,400
good chance i won't be able to get any

1079
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,119
hits

1080
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,640
on google okay so let's see

1081
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,480
what's the epoxy blobs uh

1082
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,560
well i just leave it as an epoxy blob

1083
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,640
and if you have access to

1084
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,280
uh something like fuming nitric acid you

1085
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,720
could probably remove it and see what's

1086
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,680
underneath it

1087
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,599
but that is outside the scope of this

1088
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,880
workshop

1089
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,240
so i know a few people that work with

1090
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,400
human nitric acid and it is really nasty

1091
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,720
stuff

1092
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,680
okay r17 uh this one's a 100 ohm

1093
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,240
resistor

1094
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,599
and let's see what else we have i have a

1095
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,000
c

1096
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,119
that i'm gonna have to put a question

1097
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,040
mark next to because

1098
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,720
the rest of that designator went

1099
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,720
underneath a via so there's a via right

1100
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,079
there and it clipped

1101
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,359
the number on the designator oops i hate

1102
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,040
it when that happens

1103
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,200
so i don't know what that is but we'll

1104
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,440
figure that out later

1105
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,119
and there's a q5 let's see if the q5 has

1106
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,560
the same top mark so i'm going to look

1107
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,440
at this on camera again 2a

1108
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,560
2a that happens to be

1109
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,720
uh 2 and no no sorry that would be

1110
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,200
mps 2 2 2 2 a i think i'm pretty sure

1111
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,560
someone else in the chat could probably

1112
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,240
look that up for me but 2a is a very

1113
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,359
common top mark

1114
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,880
and it's one of those really basic jelly

1115
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,200
bean transistors

1116
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,880
uh and then we have two unmarked

1117
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
resistors

1118
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,640
these are through-hole oh you know what

1119
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
they stuck the number underneath the

1120
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,920
resistor

1121
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,040
well that's a pain okay so this looks

1122
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,800
like our so i'm actually shoving it out

1123
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,720
of the way i'm pushing the resistor

1124
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,440
with my fingers and i'm looking at it

1125
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,119
with a flashlight helping me so that's

1126
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,560
r19

1127
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,240
and the value of that is 680 ohms

1128
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,000
one tip for looking at chips is that

1129
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,480
most cell phones have pretty dang good

1130
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,240
cameras on them that you can use as a

1131
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,520
microscope

1132
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,839
yes that is an excellent tip

1133
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,000
uh these as well these are the loops

1134
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,920
it's gonna say good you can also yeah

1135
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,280
the little eye loop thingies can be

1136
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,640
helpful but

1137
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,319
the quality of the optics usually isn't

1138
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,079
all that great if you have an inspection

1139
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,760
microscope of course then use that by

1140
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,280
all means

1141
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,880
my my uh little life hack was i bought a

1142
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,760
old document camera from school surplus

1143
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,000
for

1144
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,400
five dollars and it has something like

1145
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,160
30x zoom on it

1146
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,280
oh that's fantastic that's great for

1147
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,119
reverse engineering

1148
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,839
l1 is 270.

1149
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,078
i'll use 220.

1150
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,760
i'm just kind of working my way across

1151
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,319
the board uh it's probably okay if i

1152
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,359
leave a part out

1153
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,560
i'll catch it later cr1 that's a diode

1154
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,160
and let's see if the diode has a marking

1155
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,560
on it it's one of those glass ones

1156
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,560
r1n i can't really read it

1157
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,480
i would have to desolder it so i'll just

1158
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
leave it alone for now so i'll just call

1159
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,920
it one and

1160
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,760
question mark and we'll leave that alone

1161
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,560
uh here's another one cr2

1162
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,040
cr2 is a 1n4 000

1163
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,160
probably 4001.

1164
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,000
this thing doesn't really have anything

1165
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
high voltage on there and the 4001's got

1166
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,880
a 50 volt

1167
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
reverse voltage on it so that should be

1168
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,520
okay

1169
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,560
r15 is a trimmer

1170
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,640
so that is a trim potentiometer

1171
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,440
and let's see what it looks like that is

1172
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,160
a 1k

1173
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,079
i don't know what paper it is probably

1174
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,880
linear but who knows

1175
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,079
all right let me rip through a couple

1176
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:03,839
more components here

1177
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,040
i got some more transistors that's cool

1178
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,359
see if any of them are the same another

1179
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,560
2a q2

1180
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,880
is uh 1a n

1181
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,880
and q1 is another r1an

1182
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,440
i'm lucky these are just npn and pnp

1183
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,079
complementary pairs

1184
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,040
r13 and okay just a few more parts

1185
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,839
four and r2

1186
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,839
so i should probably save this

1187
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,240
huh looks like i already had one

1188
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,960
okay our 13 560 ohms

1189
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,319
and 1.8 k

1190
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,839
and r4 4.7 k

1191
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,599
and r2 is another 560.

1192
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,880
seven

1193
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,480
almost done i'm gonna do the connectors

1194
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,280
and then we'll get back to the

1195
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,839
presentation

1196
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,640
750.

1197
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,280
okay c4

1198
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,280
and c4 is probably another one of the

1199
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,760
same yes 47 microfarads 16 volt

1200
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:22,160
okay

1201
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,800
let's throw on some connectors they

1202
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,319
actually have labels on the silk screen

1203
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,119
so i know what they do

1204
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,480
and j3 is video qa is a 2n3 906 pnp

1205
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,800
generic transistor awesome

1206
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,319
yeah i knew it was something common i

1207
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,000
thought it was 2 2 2 2

1208
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,520
but 3906

1209
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,599
my brain is not quite as good as a

1210
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,319
google search

1211
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,000
it's funny there's a friend of mine who

1212
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,160
uh memorized every single one of the

1213
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,599
seven four series

1214
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,480
uh ttl part numbers so i could tell him

1215
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,200
uh

1216
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,280
74 ls74 and he'd say oh that's a

1217
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,280
dual flip-flop

1218
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,839
what a guy

1219
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,960
and c2 i think i missed c2

1220
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,079
i guess that c2 is probably a 0.1 but i

1221
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,200
won't be able to tell because it's

1222
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,960
probably wired in parallel with a number

1223
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,160
of other 0.1 microfarad capacitors

1224
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,880
but that's okay all right and this last

1225
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,000
connector

1226
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,160
does not even have a designator it's

1227
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,720
just called dcn

1228
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,240
but i'll give it an entry anyway

1229
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,560
is that it i think that's just about it

1230
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,280
and again if i missed any parts i'll go

1231
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,560
over it again later

1232
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,040
when we're doing the uh the schematic

1233
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,640
capture part of it

1234
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,800
i guess this is probably meant to be j1

1235
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,400
but

1236
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,119
i'll call it ir switch that's what it's

1237
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,480
labeled

1238
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,119
okay so now i have uh more or less a

1239
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,680
complete bill of materials

1240
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,200
and uh there's some parts that i

1241
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,920
probably need to look up at some point

1242
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,680
i already did the main one though which

1243
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,760
was that motorola part

1244
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,359
let me go and see if i can show you the

1245
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,960
data sheet again

1246
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,000
okay so here's our data sheet and we can

1247
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,520
look at some of the components that are

1248
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,880
in here so l3 and l4 these are

1249
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,119
0.22 micro henrys in other words 220

1250
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,599
henries and this corresponds with the

1251
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,280
top marks that i read off those

1252
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,480
inductors

1253
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,319
and so what that tells me is that the

1254
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,200
the values here these top marks

1255
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,400
uh where were they yeah 120

1256
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,400
that's probably 120 nano henries

1257
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,640
and these guys right here

1258
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,160
those in the wrong columns this is

1259
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,800
probably 270 nano henries

1260
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,160
and 220 nano henries

1261
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,000
and i think those were all the inductors

1262
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,200
i think there were just three

1263
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,640
let me take a look again uh one

1264
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,280
two and three yes only three inductors

1265
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,280
ir switch might be two headers one ir

1266
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,079
one switch

1267
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,000
most likely it is so most likely it's

1268
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,680
just one header strip

1269
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,400
uh comprising two distinct headers

1270
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,760
yeah so i'm not skipping the headers

1271
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,520
they're just down here marked ir

1272
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,040
and switch in fact i'll separate those

1273
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,520
out

1274
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,960
so ir and switch

1275
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,160
great okay let's go back

1276
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,000
on to the datasheet

1277
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,319
and we even have a couple of capacitor

1278
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,599
values here

1279
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,119
and some resistor values all right this

1280
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,880
is actually going to be very helpful

1281
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,720
later on when we start coming up with

1282
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,920
our schematic

1283
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,640
but i think i'm in pretty good shape to

1284
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,839
move forward so i'm going to go ahead

1285
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,359
and save this

1286
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,400
and before we switch gears

1287
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,079
what i'd like you guys to do is let me

1288
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,839
know if you're good to go

1289
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,280
for a little bit longer or if you want

1290
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,880
to take a break

1291
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,960
you know get up stretch your legs maybe

1292
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,440
get something to drink

1293
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,960
you know what why don't we do that let's

1294
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,800
just uh take like a five minute break

1295
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:21,839
listen to biden all right

1296
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,079
i think i'm still on screen with my

1297
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,200
camera

1298
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,440
i don't know if people want to see me

1299
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,800
writing stuff in my notebook but

1300
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,119
yeah i'm not i'm no longer sharing your

1301
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,640
screen i've just got my screen going

1302
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,720
right now

1303
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,800
by the way eric i i think i actually

1304
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,920
found on the bomb

1305
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,920
what uh the tiny little circuit was

1306
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,640
oh you really okay uh it's a pca

1307
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,800
9306 dual bi-directional i squared c bus

1308
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,280
and sm bus voltage level translator

1309
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,040
yes yes i've actually used those before

1310
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,720
they're great

1311
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,400
but uh i still can't find it from the

1312
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,040
markings on the top of the chip

1313
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,760
oh interesting i still have a bomb yeah

1314
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,200
does the data sheet have

1315
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,559
a top mark section in it usually

1316
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,760
sometimes you can go through there

1317
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,319
usually it's at the end

1318
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,119
and let me check

1319
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,599
the first workshop today to recognize

1320
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,000
the election results

1321
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,440
yeah exactly now i i try to stay away

1322
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,280
from politics on my uh public

1323
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,000
tube time persona as a matter of

1324
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,480
practice

1325
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,400
but uh let's just say that i was smiling

1326
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,160
a lot today

1327
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,280
so it's going to be above the uh

1328
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,200
like package outline stuff or

1329
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,400
yeah so look i look towards the end of

1330
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,440
the data sheet actually i'm going to

1331
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,720
pull that up too because i'm kind of

1332
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,839
curious myself

1333
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,880
uh let's do

1334
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,640
9306 was that it i think so

1335
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,240
okay yep oh here we go

1336
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,720
top side mark uh so i am on page three

1337
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,880
all right and so they have a couple of

1338
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,040
different numbers here like 306 p

1339
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,119
or 306c p6x is another one i forget you

1340
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,079
i forget which one

1341
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,839
yours had um

1342
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,040
give me a sec

1343
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:43,200
that's 7bd 84y

1344
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,559
7bd84y that is really odd

1345
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,359
yeah you know it could be it could be

1346
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,680
that it's not an nxp part

1347
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,520
it could be that what you have there is

1348
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,599
a compatible part from ti

1349
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,599
so i'm pretty sure ti has a part that's

1350
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,200
footprint compatible

1351
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,839
with the same function and so that might

1352
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,119
be what it is it may have gotten

1353
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,960
substituted at some point

1354
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,800
actually the data sheet that i have up

1355
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,720
right now is the ti one

1356
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,240
oh it is okay yeah

1357
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,040
interesting all right well we'll keep

1358
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,400
that in mind because when you're going

1359
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,200
through and you're

1360
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,119
putting together the schematic if any of

1361
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,480
it doesn't make any sense

1362
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,920
so for example if you're looking at the

1363
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,520
circuit and

1364
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,599
the ic isn't really connected in a way

1365
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:26,559
that makes sense

1366
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,000
for example power and ground are on the

1367
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,760
wrong pins then

1368
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,200
those are indicators that you've

1369
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,040
identified the part incorrectly

1370
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,720
that it's time to go back to google and

1371
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,200
try and figure it out

1372
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,920
yeah heading off the bomb that actually

1373
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,559
got from the guys who designed itself

1374
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,760
oh you did okay yeah but but actually

1375
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,440
i can't find anything about the top

1376
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,800
marketing

1377
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,079
yeah let me go and take a look at the on

1378
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,960
semi data sheet

1379
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,720
yeah they have a couple of different top

1380
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,720
marks here as well but

1381
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,839
none of them sound familiar

1382
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,319
yeah well it's it's not always 100 thing

1383
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,599
i mean

1384
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,119
you know if they had this fabricated in

1385
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,720
china then uh

1386
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,400
whatever contract manufacturer they used

1387
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,079
might have substituted and

1388
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,599
might have purchased it from a local

1389
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,200
vendor instead of from uh

1390
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,000
on semi or rti or even nxp

1391
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,520
sure eric um i had a question around

1392
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,240
this basically the same subject if okay

1393
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,599
if you were to get a board

1394
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,880
that was uh kind of just a cheap chinese

1395
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,680
board

1396
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,920
but they had intentionally removed the

1397
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,400
markings from the ics

1398
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,599
do you have a kind of

1399
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,119
method you go about figuring out what

1400
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,760
chips those are under the covers

1401
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,599
sure so there's a couple of things you

1402
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,079
can do at this stage in the reverse

1403
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,760
engineering effort i would just put it

1404
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,200
down as unmarked

1405
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,640
and then when we go to the next stage

1406
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,800
when we start drawing up the schematic

1407
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,480
instead of putting down a symbol for a

1408
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,000
part that you don't have

1409
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,559
put down a connector symbol that has the

1410
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,319
same number of pins

1411
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,240
and then try and get it as far as you

1412
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,640
can in the schematic reverse engineering

1413
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,200
so

1414
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,880
have as much of the rest of the circuit

1415
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,960
connected as possible

1416
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,800
and you might start getting certain

1417
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,319
clues based on

1418
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,000
things that are connected to various

1419
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
pins so for example

1420
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,680
if i notice that there's an oscillator

1421
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,119
connected to it or i should say a

1422
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,559
crystal

1423
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,400
i can look at the crystal pins and i can

1424
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,160
look at the total pin count

1425
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,000
and i can look at the vcc and ground

1426
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,160
pins and then i can say you know this is

1427
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,680
a microcontroller

1428
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,520
and based on where the power pins are

1429
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,200
and the oscillator pins are

1430
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,240
this might be a pick microcontroller for

1431
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:38,960
example

1432
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,200
or it might be an atmel avr or it might

1433
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,480
be something else

1434
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,040
and so just using those other clues

1435
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,559
based on the wires

1436
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,200
that are connecting to that chip you can

1437
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,880
make some guesses as to what it might be

1438
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,040
yeah connectors can be really hard to

1439
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,400
identify for sure

1440
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,160
so that's being discussed right now in

1441
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,079
the chat room but

1442
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,880
a lot of it is experience if you play

1443
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,559
with a lot of different connectors

1444
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,319
and you've used connectors from a lot of

1445
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,680
different manufacturers

1446
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,160
you can start getting an idea of what a

1447
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,119
connector might be

1448
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,720
even if you don't know exactly what it

1449
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,200
is or you might just look at it and say

1450
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,440
oh i know what that is that's a jst

1451
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,480
connector

1452
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,599
or oh that's a molex microfit three

1453
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,240
yeah everyone knows that so some of it

1454
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,599
is experience

1455
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,359
and a lot of it is just kind of poking

1456
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,240
around one thing that can help is if you

1457
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,839
go to the digikey

1458
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,400
visual search you can kind of drill down

1459
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,839
so you can see connectors and they'll

1460
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,440
actually show you pictures

1461
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,880
of different connectors and then you can

1462
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,920
try and drill down from there

1463
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,040
yeah even google reverse image search

1464
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,640
might be useful if you can get a really

1465
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,640
good picture of it up close

1466
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,400
but there's a good chance that their

1467
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,040
algorithms aren't quite good enough yet

1468
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,079
one also useful thing is hey just

1469
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,280
search for thing schematic thing

1470
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,599
tear down thing whatever yeah yeah

1471
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:02,400
that's good people

1472
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,680
are searching for someone else who's

1473
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,760
done it the second one that was like

1474
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,280
surprising and mind-blowing to me

1475
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,720
is the fcc website um i'll post a link

1476
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,240
in a minute but

1477
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,839
they will tear down electronics and

1478
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,920
upload interior pictures sometimes

1479
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,079
schematics that the manufacturer has to

1480
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,319
give them i found like whole toys that

1481
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,240
you know even they'd said like oh yeah

1482
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,079
please do not include this in the public

1483
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,359
record and there's still a schematic

1484
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,319
right there so

1485
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,520
yeah so the fcc when you file for the

1486
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,680
for fcc registration if your device has

1487
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,799
radios in it

1488
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:40,000
as a as a manufacturing company

1489
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,680
you're supposed to submit documentation

1490
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,640
to the fcc and the fcc will make that

1491
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,000
public and so that could include

1492
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,839
pictures of the inside of your gizmo and

1493
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,920
all of that but if i'm somebody else and

1494
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,359
i want to figure out how your gizmo

1495
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:54,240
works

1496
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,880
and you've got an fcc number on your

1497
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,559
product as you were legally required to

1498
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,760
do

1499
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,200
then in that case i can just plug it

1500
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,040
into the fcc database

1501
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,640
and gather all kinds of interesting

1502
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,480
information about it

1503
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,440
that's another good comment uh so eric i

1504
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,040
just wanted to jump back to my boring

1505
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,160
chip again

1506
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,559
okay great we wanted to give you uh you

1507
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,720
were basically right it's actually in

1508
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,520
the ti

1509
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,079
data sheet uh excellent it's called

1510
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,200
device marking

1511
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,680
7bd okay which is the top row of the

1512
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,400
marking

1513
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,079
so this is a package type sm8 wonderful

1514
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,319
yeah so estimate in fact if you look at

1515
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:31,440
the third one

1516
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,520
sorry if you look up their package

1517
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,599
diagrams near the end of the data sheet

1518
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,119
and you plug in sm8

1519
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,559
you can actually find the industry

1520
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,040
standard name for it uh ti likes to use

1521
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,559
multiple layers of indirection for

1522
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:43,839
package names which is kind of

1523
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:44,960
irritating

1524
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,359
but sm8 will correspond with i think

1525
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,119
it's probably

1526
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,240
an eight pin sot which is a little bit

1527
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:52,960
uncommon

1528
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,880
but some devices use it

1529
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,400
i'm glad to hear that you figured it out

1530
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,079
uh sebastian also had some great

1531
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,520
comments that he left in the group chat

1532
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,960
and i want to repeat those for everybody

1533
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,319
else on the streams

1534
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,799
so if a chip is unmarked check to see if

1535
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,319
it's really unmarked

1536
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,240
sometimes you can see it with a torch or

1537
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,000
flashlight for hear us here in the

1538
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,359
united states

1539
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:14,960
if you uh shine the light at the right

1540
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,280
angle you can also put some isopropyl

1541
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,480
alcohol on there

1542
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,160
and clean the surface and take a closer

1543
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,119
look

1544
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,839
uh yeah removed was visible underneath

1545
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,280
the light in the right angle yeah

1546
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,760
so having a microscope helps uh you can

1547
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,480
clean it with

1548
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,960
isopropyl alcohol or rubbing alcohol and

1549
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,480
then shine a flashlight

1550
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,920
adjust the angle a lot and then

1551
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,240
eventually you'll get contrast

1552
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,680
that works really well for parts that

1553
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,839
have been laser marked where the marking

1554
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,160
is really faint

1555
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,680
this was an extremely difficult bit of

1556
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,920
googling somebody pastes in

1557
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,319
a link from amphenol i'm going to bring

1558
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,599
that up because i'm curious

1559
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:52,960
and maybe some of the rest of you are

1560
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,720
too

1561
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,359
uh ethanol icc oh this is a battery

1562
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:58,559
connector

1563
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,000
yeah yeah so uh receptacle and blade

1564
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,760
four position

1565
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,520
rota connect oh i might be wrong

1566
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,359
actually so rota connect is

1567
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,920
a that's not for batteries that's for a

1568
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,520
pivoting connector

1569
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,599
that's really interesting so it looks

1570
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:14,960
like they're marketing it towards

1571
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,520
uh lighting products so probably led

1572
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,319
lighting

1573
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:21,440
that's a really good find

1574
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,480
okay so it's 5 30 now for me

1575
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,040
in my time zone now we've got about an

1576
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,040
hour left and i want to use that time to

1577
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:29,359
go

1578
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,040
through the next stage of reverse

1579
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,960
engineering uh hopefully you've all had

1580
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,200
an

1581
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,119
opportunity to put together a relatively

1582
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,280
complete bill of materials

1583
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,319
for the board that you're trying to

1584
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:41,280
reverse engineer and if not that's okay

1585
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,200
you can come back to it later but we're

1586
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,640
going to go ahead and

1587
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,920
move on to discussing the next stage

1588
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,960
of the reverse engineering

1589
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,520
so let me go back to where we were

1590
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,759
now it is your turn

1591
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:06,160
okay hopefully you all can see this

1592
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,920
and it's not stuck on my camera view let

1593
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,559
me go back and check real quick

1594
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,559
good all right so you should be able to

1595
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,720
see the slides now

1596
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,480
all right so now we're getting on to the

1597
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,880
hard part so top marks have their own

1598
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,160
challenges

1599
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,680
this part is actually getting kind of

1600
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,599
challenging

1601
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,359
is there a link to these slides if you

1602
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:26,720
need a link to the slides then you're

1603
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,480
probably not seeing these

1604
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,280
let me see if there's a way to manage

1605
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,200
that

1606
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,599
hold on one sec i guess if i can't do

1607
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,839
that

1608
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:40,799
we're seeing them i think they probably

1609
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,680
just oh you are okay great all right

1610
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,680
uh yeah eventually i'll post a link to

1611
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,359
these at some point later when i get a

1612
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,079
chance to

1613
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,640
put them up uh unfortunately they're not

1614
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,680
really going to mean too much

1615
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,720
outside the context of this workshop so

1616
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,319
really the workshop here is for you to

1617
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,079
gain practical experience

1618
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,119
uh working with these things and uh of

1619
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,880
course you can make use of your

1620
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,880
bookmark function in your browser to

1621
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,880
bookmark any of these google resources

1622
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,599
that came up i do have a couple of links

1623
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,400
in here

1624
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,720
for things like topmark lookups but

1625
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,000
honestly the links that people

1626
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,520
have been pasting into the group chat

1627
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,280
are probably better

1628
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,000
um okay great so let me go ahead and get

1629
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,880
back to this

1630
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,400
i'll also talk with the hackaday folks

1631
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,760
about maybe putting the slides up on

1632
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,559
their

1633
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,960
website as well okay so let's get on to

1634
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,000
the hard part we need some high

1635
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,680
resolution photos

1636
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,200
of the top and the bottom of the circuit

1637
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,119
board now i've already done that for my

1638
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:33,760
board

1639
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,520
uh earlier today when i had a chance to

1640
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,839
do that you can use a cell phone

1641
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,680
uh the trick is is you want really good

1642
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,520
lighting so do it somewhere where you've

1643
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,040
got really nice bright

1644
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,000
even lighting and take a picture

1645
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,760
straight on with a cell phone

1646
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,760
uh or you could do it in a scanner you

1647
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,079
could use a digital slr if you want

1648
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,599
the key is that you want it to be in

1649
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,280
focus and you want to be able to see

1650
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,000
fine details so if you need to put on a

1651
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,760
macro lens or whatever just

1652
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,280
whatever it takes to get a good

1653
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,960
photograph of

1654
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,200
the top and bottom of the circuit board

1655
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,799
and you want to be able to see detail

1656
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,759
that's the important thing

1657
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,040
yes the sun is great but it's not always

1658
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,599
there

1659
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,599
uh for me it's doesn't seem to be there

1660
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:18,640
right now

1661
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,400
uh maybe it is there for some of the

1662
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
others of you it seems to be kind of

1663
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,839
random

1664
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,960
anyway let's talk about the pictures

1665
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,599
and what you do with them and so the

1666
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,040
next step is once you've got these

1667
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,480
pictures is you'll want to pull them

1668
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:32,880
both

1669
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,760
into your favorite image editing suite

1670
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,880
so i'm just going to use the

1671
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,559
because it's free and maybe some of the

1672
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,480
rest of you are using it too

1673
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,000
i really hope they change the name at

1674
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,599
some point because every time i say that

1675
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,359
i cringe inwardly

1676
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:48,160
and i hope i'm not the only one so what

1677
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,640
you're going to do

1678
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,760
yeah the the the new image manipulation

1679
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,440
program is so it's an acronym that was

1680
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,880
rather badly chosen

1681
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,160
i think someone thought they were being

1682
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,920
cute and this was in the 90s

1683
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,520
so anyway so the idea is that you import

1684
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,760
the images and you want to flip

1685
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,520
the image that represents the bottom

1686
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,119
layer and so you've imported them as two

1687
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,160
different layers

1688
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,760
and then once you've flipped it then you

1689
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,359
want to crop it and line it up using the

1690
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,400
cage tool

1691
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,160
i'll actually demonstrate this for you

1692
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,760
in a minute so don't get too bent out of

1693
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,039
shape

1694
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:19,680
the next step after that is you open up

1695
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,799
kai-cad

1696
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,480
and you start putting down all the

1697
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,400
components from your bill of materials

1698
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,559
and so if it's a capacitor then drop

1699
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,000
down a capacitor and then set the

1700
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,359
designator to match

1701
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:30,880
and then just do that for every part

1702
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,960
that you've got in the bill of materials

1703
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,720
now if you don't know the pin out then

1704
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,640
just use a connector you know just use

1705
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,280
any old

1706
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,119
random thing that doesn't specify the

1707
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:40,400
function of the device

1708
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,799
but just has pins on it with pin numbers

1709
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,160
and so that way you can kind of keep

1710
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:44,960
track

1711
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,200
of what you've done as far as reverse

1712
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,880
engineering is concerned

1713
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,039
and then the next step is to trace over

1714
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,079
the circuit

1715
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,520
and so what i've done here is i've

1716
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,200
marked traces in red

1717
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,400
that i've already digitized into

1718
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,480
my own schematic so i use that to keep

1719
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,839
track of where i am so i don't

1720
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:03,440
accidentally and try to enter the same

1721
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,760
wire twice

1722
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,920
and if you run into problems so for

1723
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,440
example you might have a trace

1724
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,599
that goes to a hard to reach place you

1725
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,760
can shine a flashlight through the board

1726
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,200
and actually see where some of those

1727
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,599
traces go if you've got the board with

1728
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,640
you physically which

1729
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,559
i hope most of you or all of you have

1730
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,400
then you can also use a multimeter

1731
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,480
and you can buzz out the connections in

1732
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,079
diode check mode or in

1733
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,720
continuity test mode so something that

1734
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,280
hopefully

1735
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,680
makes a beeping sound let me try and

1736
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,280
catch up with the chat room a little bit

1737
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,319
there's a fork of

1738
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,559
called glimpse all right i'll have to

1739
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,799
try that at some point

1740
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,400
uh different colors for top versus

1741
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,760
bottom yeah so there are some tricks

1742
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,440
that you can do about that

1743
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,799
i'll just overlap them and i'll show you

1744
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,480
how that works in a minute

1745
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,880
finally you can also remove parts to

1746
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,400
look underneath them

1747
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,079
and so here's an example of that when i

1748
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,160
was doing the snark marker which is my

1749
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,000
reverse engineered version of the sound

1750
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,720
blaster card from uh

1751
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,200
1992. uh what i did

1752
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,720
i only had pictures of it i don't

1753
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,559
actually have a physical card because

1754
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,119
they're expensive but i found somebody

1755
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,640
on twitter who did have

1756
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,799
the card and that person was willing to

1757
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:11,680
remove parts

1758
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,720
for me and take pictures and so

1759
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,119
that individual sent me all these images

1760
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,240
and i used those

1761
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,240
to figure out where these traces went

1762
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,680
and so you can see here there's quite a

1763
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,680
few traces that go underneath these

1764
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,160
dip ics and there's just really no way

1765
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,280
for me to tell

1766
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,880
where those would have gone without

1767
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,440
removing those parts

1768
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,119
now i did not have the luxury in the

1769
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,720
case of this card

1770
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,799
this is the micro channel version of the

1771
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,400
ad-lib sound card

1772
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,160
of which there are very few known

1773
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,839
examples in the world i think there's

1774
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,760
maybe only two or three cards known to

1775
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,960
exist

1776
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,319
and the gentleman in germany uh

1777
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,200
who had pictures of the card was not

1778
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,000
willing to

1779
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,920
do any soldering on it for obvious

1780
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,839
reasons you know since it is kind of a

1781
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,039
collectible

1782
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,680
artifact and so he sent me pictures of

1783
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,119
the top and bottom and i just had to

1784
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:01,760
guess

1785
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,359
as to where those wires were going and

1786
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,280
so i would draw in white

1787
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,520
what my guess was and then later on i

1788
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,119
could go back and fix it if it didn't

1789
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,720
make sense on the schematic

1790
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,240
and so i had to turn on sort of the

1791
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,319
engineering half of my brain

1792
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,000
and look at it as an engineer would

1793
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,680
saying well how would i design this

1794
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,319
circuit

1795
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,720
if i were designing it and i know that

1796
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,079
some of you don't always have the

1797
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,880
luxury of experience to lean on but at

1798
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,640
least this is a potential trick that you

1799
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,400
could use in the future

1800
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,760
or you could make guesses and they might

1801
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,839
be wrong and you just

1802
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,200
kind of muddle through maybe take some

1803
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,520
measurements maybe you measure

1804
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,599
voltages or measure something with an

1805
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:38,880
oscilloscope you can make some more

1806
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,960
guesses based on that

1807
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,400
yeah so the red part here is a ground

1808
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,599
plane that's on the other side of the

1809
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,200
board

1810
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,480
okay let's go ahead and dig into the

1811
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,839
practical part

1812
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,480
so these are the images that i made and

1813
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,680
so i'm gonna go ahead and end my

1814
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,280
presentation here

1815
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,640
and i'm gonna go and bring up the

1816
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,160
uh gnu image manipulation program

1817
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,599
with all of its toolbars

1818
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,799
and let me go and find where i put those

1819
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,880
images

1820
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,359
being the brilliant person i am i did

1821
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:14,960
not

1822
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,319
leave a window open with the files in it

1823
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:20,400
so i have to go find those while

1824
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,720
hopefully you can spend some time

1825
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,119
taking the pictures and getting all of

1826
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,119
that set up

1827
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:30,559
so let me go and dig for those

1828
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,079
oh wait a minute here we go

1829
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,760
that looks right

1830
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,640
okay import

1831
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,720
sure do whatever you want okay

1832
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:50,000
so here's the first image and i'm going

1833
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,640
to do

1834
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,559
an open as layers again i want this to

1835
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,000
come in as a

1836
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
as a second layer inside the image you

1837
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,039
know what

1838
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,119
actually before i do that i'm gonna go

1839
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:02,799
and

1840
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,319
i'm gonna open that as a separate image

1841
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,079
actually

1842
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,359
and i'll show you why in a minute

1843
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,440
okay oh it did add it as a second layer

1844
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,839
shoot

1845
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,599
let me just create a blank image and do

1846
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,520
it that way

1847
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,039
uh the reason is is that i need to do

1848
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,319
some cropping first

1849
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,119
oh did i crash it

1850
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,720
no there's a dialogue that stole the

1851
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,160
focus okay there we go

1852
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,359
much better okay so here we are i've got

1853
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:43,760
images of the front of the back

1854
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,240
let me know if you guys need more time

1855
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,598
to take your pictures

1856
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,559
see question mark might be c9 an iron

1857
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,079
switch are indeed two headers

1858
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:56,079
yeah there's a line in between yeah so

1859
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:58,079
it might be c9 but again i'll work

1860
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,640
through those

1861
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,400
uh once i'm drawing up the schematic if

1862
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,960
there's a gap in the designators

1863
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,599
then a process of logical elimination

1864
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,240
would lead me to say that yes this is c9

1865
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,680
but i won't know that for sure until i

1866
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,640
get there and so the first step

1867
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,520
is to go in and crop i'm going to use

1868
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,799
the top one here

1869
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,479
as sort of the master image and so i'm

1870
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,279
not going to crop it all that tightly

1871
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,640
so we'll crop that one this bottom image

1872
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,359
i'm going to crop more tightly

1873
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:28,799
just to help me out for alignment

1874
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,439
purposes

1875
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,839
okay

1876
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,799
and so we'll copy that and then i will

1877
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,799
paste this in

1878
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:42,158
as a new layer and

1879
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:43,839
on this layer let me make sure it's

1880
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:45,839
selected

1881
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:48,560
let's see if i can do a flip so

1882
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,439
transform

1883
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:52,319
flip horizontally and i'm going to grab

1884
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,440
the move tool here

1885
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,600
and would it have been better to solder

1886
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,198
the wires before taking the image

1887
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:01,279
probably yes but this is a good example

1888
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,439
of why it's also handy to have

1889
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,359
the physical board in front of you and

1890
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,359
so you can move the wire out of the way

1891
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,759
and see where the trace goes but i'm

1892
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,120
just i guess trying to mimic

1893
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,040
a situation where you're reverse

1894
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,238
engineering something

1895
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:17,279
and you only have a picture okay

1896
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,198
so the next thing that you'll notice is

1897
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:20,799
that these images don't line up

1898
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:22,479
precisely

1899
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:24,319
and so what we're going to need to do is

1900
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:25,600
use the cage

1901
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,920
transform to try and get these to match

1902
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,319
up now this is a little bit imprecise

1903
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:32,640
and so i'm just going to give it a shot

1904
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,479
and see what happens

1905
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:37,679
uh so the first step if i was doing this

1906
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:38,158
right

1907
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:40,080
uh the first step here actually before i

1908
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,158
do that i'm gonna change the

1909
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:45,439
opacity in my pasted layer

1910
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,719
okay so here we go cage transform

1911
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,359
i'm going to click in the corner of the

1912
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,238
bottom layer

1913
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:55,360
image so i'm going to grab each corner

1914
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,080
with the cage

1915
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,880
transform this one has a little bit of

1916
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,840
an overhang so i'm going to try and grab

1917
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,840
that

1918
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,480
okay so now i've got a cage it's

1919
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,400
computing cage coefficients

1920
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,159
this takes a while because it's a pretty

1921
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,400
high resolution

1922
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,280
screen here okay now we're gonna go

1923
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,080
ahead and adjust

1924
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,679
these uh you know what i need to do i

1925
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:20,320
need to

1926
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,719
set the layer constraints to match the

1927
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,640
drawing

1928
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,239
there we go all right now let's do the

1929
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:30,080
cage transformer again

1930
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,120
so i'm gonna grab here

1931
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,920
grab here

1932
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,000
that looks about right it doesn't have

1933
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,719
to be exact

1934
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:41,920
we'll let it compute its cage

1935
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,440
coefficients again

1936
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,159
done all right and we're going to drag

1937
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,080
those to the corners of the board

1938
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,600
on the other layer yeah those are rca

1939
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,920
plugs for example

1940
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,679
i have not heard tulip that might be a

1941
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:00,400
european designation

1942
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,920
okay so i'm just grabbing these little

1943
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,520
handles that i put in in the cage

1944
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,120
transform

1945
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,400
and i'm just lining them up

1946
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:13,839
ah that might have been wrong let's see

1947
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,640
okay now what i can also do is flip this

1948
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,120
other layer on and off

1949
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,600
and see those vias see these little

1950
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,360
shiny views here

1951
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,120
let's see how well they line up across

1952
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,000
the board that's actually pretty good

1953
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,280
that might be close enough

1954
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,679
all right fine we'll call that good and

1955
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,360
uh so we're done here

1956
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,360
let me complete the transform so i'll

1957
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,839
hit enter

1958
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,880
yeah these i think are not meant to be

1959
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,320
mounted through the board

1960
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,480
these rca connectors i think they're

1961
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,560
actually a cable mount rca

1962
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,719
plugs but some very clever designer

1963
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,440
bought these as a separate part and made

1964
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,520
a footprint for them on the board

1965
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,199
so it's actually a little odd if you see

1966
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,960
on the camera

1967
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,040
it's got these little wire loops that

1968
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,239
come out

1969
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,840
that are basically soldered into the

1970
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,440
tips of the

1971
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,520
connector just like you would a cable

1972
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,360
and then they kind of branch down

1973
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,199
over and solder onto the circuit board

1974
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,560
here

1975
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,640
very strange okay so here's my circuit

1976
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,760
let's go ahead and close this uh let's

1977
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,640
go and save this

1978
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:27,920
i'm gonna go ahead and stash this

1979
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,840
somewhere sure we'll call it that

1980
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,320
what's the nice number like 20 20 1107

1981
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:34,880
and

1982
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,600
i guess it's the date and let's fire up

1983
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,080
kaicad

1984
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,800
okay let's create a new project

1985
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,520
i'm gonna put it in the same folder

1986
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,880
sorry you won't be able to see this this

1987
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,239
is off screen this is on my other

1988
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,718
monitor

1989
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,480
i'm just creating project

1990
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,880
okay so here is kai-cad

1991
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,320
and here's the video schematic

1992
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,400
and there is nothing quite like a blank

1993
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:19,120
kycad schematic so many possibilities

1994
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,640
and now let's go back to this bill of

1995
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,159
materials

1996
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,000
let me just sort of squish this down

1997
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,040
here so i can see both at the same time

1998
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,280
and the next step of the process is a

1999
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,400
little tedious but

2000
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:34,000
uh tasks in reverse engineering are

2001
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,600
i'm just going to go through and start

2002
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,719
adding components one at a time

2003
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:40,320
if you've got a four layer board and

2004
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,560
you're lucky the two inner layers are

2005
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,239
just power and ground and you may be

2006
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:45,520
able to ignore them

2007
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,679
i've seen boards where they use some of

2008
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:50,719
those power and ground plane

2009
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,280
inner layers as a cheating way to route

2010
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,719
a trace or two

2011
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:56,719
and even if they do that you're probably

2012
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,280
still okay you could get pretty darn far

2013
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,679
with just the outer layers if you've got

2014
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,840
any more layers than that

2015
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,199
the reverse engineering becomes

2016
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,120
significantly more challenging without

2017
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,320
extra equipment like an x-ray or

2018
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,840
you could do a destructive reverse

2019
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,480
engineering using sandpaper but that

2020
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,719
also generates some pretty toxic dust

2021
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,960
and it takes a lot longer and it's it's

2022
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,199
pretty hard to get it right

2023
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,800
okay so the first part i want to put

2024
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,880
down i

2025
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,719
doubt there's a symbol for it there's an

2026
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:29,920
mc1372

2027
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,320
but there is not an mc1374

2028
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,159
and so what i'm going to do instead is

2029
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,440
just put down a

2030
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:42,800
14-pin connector i think on

2031
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,239
o2 x 14 and

2032
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,120
we're going to want to do

2033
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,280
counterclockwise

2034
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,400
so that it lines up with a typical ic oh

2035
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,520
i'm sorry 07.

2036
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,719
okay that had too many pins okay and so

2037
01:14:58,719 --> 01:14:59,520
we're going to use this

2038
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,640
as a stand in for that first part and

2039
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,840
i'm even going to rename it u1

2040
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:13,040
okay save two bio7 thank you i noticed

2041
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,159
okay let's get some more parts in here

2042
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:19,520
uh u2 is a 7808 let's see if that's in

2043
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:19,920
there

2044
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,640
look at that lm7808 and

2045
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:29,679
call that u2 next one is c1

2046
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,440
i like the small ones i don't know why

2047
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,400
i think it's called see underscore small

2048
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,040
yeah that's what i want

2049
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,040
and again i also tend to cram a lot of

2050
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,320
parts under my schematic sheets

2051
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,000
and i don't know what that is so i'll

2052
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,880
just leave that for now

2053
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,199
let's do r1 technically i should be

2054
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,719
marking these as i complete them so i'm

2055
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,159
just going to go

2056
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:01,199
mark them with bold so

2057
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:07,839
r1 is 27k

2058
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,000
should i use the us symbol or the

2059
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,159
european symbol let me use the us symbol

2060
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,280
because it's our date today

2061
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,120
i'm sure most of you agree and i need to

2062
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,159
put in a value

2063
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,960
27k

2064
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,640
and i'm lazy so i'm just going to make a

2065
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,520
copy this one's r9

2066
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:35,040
and that's going to be 39k

2067
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,719
okay i'll just go through one at a time

2068
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,760
let's keep going

2069
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,159
r5

2070
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,159
if you have any questions as always

2071
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,840
please don't hesitate to let me know

2072
01:16:51,840 --> 01:17:03,840
either by voice or by chat

2073
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:09,520
got that about that

2074
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,560
and for an inductor

2075
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,120
uh that's not the inductor i want let's

2076
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,520
try l

2077
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,199
even better if there's an l underscore

2078
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:23,519
small

2079
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:31,839
l three

2080
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:45,840
aren't you glad you chose a small board

2081
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,239
okay so c3 is actually uh polarized

2082
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:59,839
so i'm going to need a polarized

2083
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:03,040
capacitor

2084
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,440
okay that one is

2085
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,840
c16

2086
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,520
47 16.

2087
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,440
it's more fun to do this to music but i

2088
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,560
want to avoid

2089
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,760
triggering the copyright bus

2090
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,360
c14

2091
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:35,600
again i don't know the value of these

2092
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,679
surface mount ceramic capacitors but

2093
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,840
that's okay we'll figure it out later

2094
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,400
could it disable a video from your site

2095
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,760
all this time ah that was the problem

2096
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,000
yeah i still don't know all the ins and

2097
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,080
outs of zoom

2098
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,360
that's surprising all right so we need

2099
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,400
r1an didn't we already figure out what

2100
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,799
that was

2101
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,080
could have sworn we already figured out

2102
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,000
what that was

2103
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
now we figured out the 2a

2104
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,840
okay so i'm going to have to go and

2105
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,400
google this

2106
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,320
let's do a

2107
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:22,080
and stop23 transistor

2108
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,400
let's see what that is uh is

2109
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,080
available for windows yes it is

2110
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,920
there's uh even pre-compiled ones

2111
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,000
uh must include r1an

2112
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,760
it says it looks like there aren't any

2113
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,520
great matches and then it has a fine

2114
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,800
chips result

2115
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,880
that talks about a surface mount pnp

2116
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,520
transistor

2117
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,880
hey was a false result

2118
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,320
thank you fine chips

2119
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:02,480
just trying to figure out a way to get

2120
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,400
some smack talking in about fine chips

2121
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,120
because they're

2122
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,159
after all a uh they own uh

2123
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:11,920
pack a day so r-i-a-n maybe

2124
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,040
ah here we go that looks more promising

2125
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,280
oh wait no i picked up on a word here

2126
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,480
variance

2127
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,320
great is that n smaller than the r1a by

2128
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,000
any chance

2129
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,480
well i don't remember let's take a look

2130
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,920
why yes it is that n

2131
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:32,320
is smaller so maybe i just want r1a

2132
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,360
and leave off the n

2133
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,639
ah that's

2134
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:42,000
bringing up some results of

2135
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,239
inductors let's try r1a

2136
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:48,959
oh here we go

2137
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,760
mmbt 3904

2138
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:00,719
3904 mystery solved

2139
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:03,040
all right so the lesson there was that

2140
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,800
little tiny letter n

2141
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,719
was some kind of a package code or lot

2142
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:08,320
code or something like that

2143
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,920
and not technically part of the top mark

2144
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,280
that was good call okay so let's do

2145
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,040
a and then the t3904

2146
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,159
look at that it's already in here and

2147
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:22,480
this

2148
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,440
is q3

2149
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,880
and next up is c13 which is a trimmer

2150
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,120
cap

2151
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,159
let's see if i can find there's a c

2152
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:39,520
trim that'll work symbol is a little

2153
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,679
weird but that's okay

2154
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,159
and i should start bolding ones that

2155
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:46,880
i've

2156
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,520
done already

2157
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:57,840
our 17 is 100 ohms

2158
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,719
or use a sharpie to mark all the traces

2159
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:10,159
by hand and remove it with ipa

2160
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:13,360
afterwards yeah you can do that

2161
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:22,400
i'm just following up with the chat

2162
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,280
most the functionality may still be

2163
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,600
hidden within the firmware on the mcu

2164
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,199
i do have experience going into the

2165
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,679
firmware uh but i see that there is also

2166
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:32,159
a

2167
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:35,840
session at remoticon on firmware

2168
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,520
reverse engineering so that would be a

2169
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,639
good session to attend

2170
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,639
okay i did c13 let's do r17 i already

2171
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,239
did that one

2172
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:51,440
c question mark let's do c question mark

2173
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,239
done i'll have to come back to that one

2174
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,520
later

2175
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:07,600
okay this one is a 3906 this is q5

2176
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,960
tomorrow is hardware debugging

2177
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,920
no there is one tomorrow for extracting

2178
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,080
firmware

2179
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,920
oh okay bare metal firmware wasn't

2180
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,679
really covered

2181
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:21,840
i named our a podcast is playing okay

2182
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:22,719
good all right

2183
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:25,679
all right so it's a very complex topic

2184
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,760
that deserves its own workshop

2185
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,360
so maybe someday but i i have used some

2186
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,000
fairly advanced techniques

2187
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,520
for doing reverse engineering of

2188
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,679
firmware but the typical approach is

2189
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,280
that you want to extract the firmware

2190
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,600
from a microcontroller somehow

2191
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,199
and there are a bunch of different ways

2192
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,440
of doing it

2193
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,440
not all of them are practical some of

2194
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,199
them require things like probe stations

2195
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:51,520
and fuming nitric acid

2196
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,199
and i have done a little bit of that

2197
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:03,839
oops and i am really having trouble

2198
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:09,040
okay so it's r19 i want

2199
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:16,000
oh yeah yeah i'm butterfingers today

2200
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,800
okay so that's r19 and r19 is 680

2201
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,080
and copy that again

2202
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:30,480
and this is

2203
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,599
i want a capacitor

2204
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:38,239
that is going to be c15

2205
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:46,080
r18 is 390.

2206
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,400
all right i'm trying to follow up with

2207
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,239
the chat here occasionally

2208
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:53,600
somebody wants to do glitching yeah you

2209
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,040
can do glitching it can get really

2210
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,560
complicated

2211
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,239
you have a nor flash lucky you you can

2212
01:24:58,239 --> 01:24:59,600
just pull off the north flash and read

2213
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,040
that back but it doesn't always hold all

2214
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,000
the firmware it might store

2215
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,320
configuration information

2216
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,480
yeah that is that is worthy of a uh a

2217
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,480
day-long session for sure

2218
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:13,120
it's just a endlessly complicated topic

2219
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,239
lots of rabbit holes to go into uh

2220
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:22,000
l1 and l2 let's do l1 and l2

2221
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,159
l1 and l2

2222
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:29,599
l1 is 270

2223
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:34,080
and l2 is 220.

2224
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,440
i'm actually really excited about this

2225
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,719
board because i didn't think i would

2226
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:38,080
ever be able to use it for anything it

2227
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:41,840
was literally sitting in my junk pile

2228
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,400
okay cr1

2229
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:54,679
i believe that's just a regular diode

2230
01:25:54,679 --> 01:25:57,679
cr1 bonus points to anyone who knows

2231
01:25:57,679 --> 01:25:58,560
what cr

2232
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:09,120
stands for

2233
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:12,880
well cr is a rectifier yes

2234
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,400
but i don't know what the c stands for

2235
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,320
maybe somebody knows

2236
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:23,840
correctifier correctifier

2237
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,560
and i believe this one is a one and four

2238
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,719
thousand one

2239
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:30,320
so i couldn't see the last two digits

2240
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,320
and i'm assuming it's an a1

2241
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,560
just because this board has not got

2242
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,520
anything over 50 volts on it

2243
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,360
common coil relay crystal rectifier

2244
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,480
ooh so plausible

2245
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,239
i don't think that's it though

2246
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,520
hmm that is a tricky one all right

2247
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:57,199
i gotta think about it prefixes are fun

2248
01:26:57,199 --> 01:27:00,480
r15 is a trimmer pot okay so we're going

2249
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:04,960
to need to find a trimmer

2250
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,800
r trim i don't like that symbol let's

2251
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,239
just use a regular potentiometer

2252
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,000
now the pin out of course on this is not

2253
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,840
going to match what we have but that's

2254
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,360
okay we'll try and wire it up correctly

2255
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,839
anyway

2256
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,159
and i believe that was a 1k

2257
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:33,520
uh c11 another one of these little guys

2258
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,199
and that is our official half hour

2259
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:38,239
warning going off

2260
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,480
i'm definitely not going to be able to

2261
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,639
finish this board tonight

2262
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:44,880
but i want to at least show you the

2263
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,639
process

2264
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:50,320
of tracing it out

2265
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:54,559
r16 that's a 1k

2266
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,480
oh so many parts all right i'm going to

2267
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,000
speed this up by moving this over to my

2268
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:02,800
other monitor

2269
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,320
and i'm just going to focus on getting

2270
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,400
this done because i want to be able to

2271
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,760
demonstrate more techniques

2272
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,920
so i'm going to go a little quiet while

2273
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:15,840
i just sort of hammer this out

2274
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,880
well you're doing that eric can i show

2275
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,719
um a board that i've got

2276
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:28,239
and just get some audience feedback sure

2277
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:29,360
let's go and put that up

2278
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,080
uh where are you okay this is andy andy

2279
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,280
gifford

2280
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,880
uh hang on let me try and find you

2281
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,120
if you turn on your video it might pop

2282
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,960
you up to the top of the list i'm sorry

2283
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,719
yeah i know that oh wait no i got

2284
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:48,239
i don't know yeah

2285
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,360
oh there you are okay great

2286
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,360
here's your story sorry for the

2287
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,120
distraction and you guys

2288
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:59,040
know i didn't have a good board um

2289
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,800
to follow along this is a prototype

2290
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,120
somebody made at some point

2291
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:06,239
does do any of these labels

2292
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:11,600
mean anything to you guys like ucl dcl

2293
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,000
it did have this is there any way we can

2294
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,239
bring it up uh like full screen i have a

2295
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:20,159
very small view of your camera

2296
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,320
i don't know i don't want to distract

2297
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,080
eric he's trying to it's it's already

2298
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,800
shared as best as i can over here

2299
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,719
okay so there may be a zoom setting on

2300
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:32,400
your side i'm not familiar enough with

2301
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,800
zoom to be able to tell you exactly what

2302
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,120
there's a view options thing at the top

2303
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,960
and you can change it to side by side

2304
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:39,360
mode

2305
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,080
and then you can uh change the the ratio

2306
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,960
of sizes between the presenter and the

2307
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,040
person talking and you can get a little

2308
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,800
bit bigger that way

2309
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:53,840
thank you and got it figured yeah

2310
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,080
i don't know it's just kind of a random

2311
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,679
question these are there's a bunch of

2312
01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:58,800
buttons

2313
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,199
there's a red led it's a momentary

2314
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:03,520
button

2315
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,880
oh those are cool they are funky

2316
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:12,480
and then there's safe ins and ids

2317
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,800
it seems like it was a test board for

2318
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,840
something

2319
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,960
there's also a pass

2320
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:24,320
um it says pass up here

2321
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,480
just thought you guys might go oh i know

2322
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,600
what that is

2323
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,360
to relay a bunch of lights and buttons

2324
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,600
that's about it about it

2325
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:35,199
oh and then this is

2326
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:39,678
the routing is interesting

2327
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:48,800
literally harry yeah i've been picking

2328
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,239
up a lot in this

2329
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:51,520
one of the things that i was listening

2330
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,880
to earlier was the um

2331
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,000
like how do you figure out what a

2332
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,600
component is when it's not labeled the

2333
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,440
resistor capacitor

2334
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,760
oh man there's no secret way to do it

2335
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,120
other than pull it off and

2336
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:07,520
check it oh well anyway

2337
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,040
yeah in-circuit measurements aren't

2338
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,040
always possible depending on what the

2339
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,320
schematic looks like

2340
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,000
so if there's nothing connected to the

2341
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,360
other end like if it goes out to a

2342
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,639
connector or something

2343
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:18,800
then you can measure it in circuit

2344
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,760
otherwise

2345
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,520
it's not really gonna work

2346
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,840
all right i'll go back to quiet mode

2347
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:32,639
here thanks for sharing

2348
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,520
and i'm back again i'm almost done i got

2349
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,120
a couple more parts and then we'll be

2350
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:45,840
able to move on to the next part

2351
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,960
okay r2

2352
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:52,719
i have 60 see if i had planned better i

2353
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,000
would have done this in advance but

2354
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,639
where would be the fun in that

2355
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:00,000
and seven i think was

2356
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:05,520
50. that right that sounds like a mark

2357
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,840
r7 that's the mark this is actually 75

2358
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,880
ohms

2359
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:18,719
i made a mistake there r2 is 560.

2360
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,719
the reason i did that correction is

2361
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:23,840
because i was expecting to see a 75 ohm

2362
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,520
series termination resistor in there

2363
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,440
somewhere and so that was

2364
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:30,960
my experience saving my butt

2365
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,000
sometimes it does that

2366
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:38,239
uh okay here's another electrolytic

2367
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:41,839
that one is c4

2368
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:44,159
all right now we're off to the

2369
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:46,719
connectors

2370
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:51,840
let's do a coaxial connector for

2371
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,600
a2 and j3

2372
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:00,000
b2 is audio i can spell sometimes

2373
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,360
j3 is video

2374
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:08,960
okay those two connect oh there's still

2375
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:10,080
more parts there's a

2376
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,600
c see i'm just putting them more

2377
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,199
wherever

2378
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:18,800
c2 uh okay now now we have bcn

2379
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:22,000
and that's a two pin header so let's do

2380
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,360
a con o2 x01

2381
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:31,440
which one looks nicer ah who cares i'll

2382
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:36,000
use this one for now

2383
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,520
call that one bcn

2384
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,080
that one's done and then there's ir and

2385
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,280
switch

2386
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:48,639
ir is two pins and

2387
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:51,840
switch is four pins

2388
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:01,599
okay

2389
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:06,719
now let's place the four pin connector

2390
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,480
you know what i should have used the

2391
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,639
other con 01

2392
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:15,280
x04 see now i'm regretting the connector

2393
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,120
choice already

2394
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,840
that's okay

2395
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,920
switch okay

2396
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,440
so that is basically it

2397
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,000
all right let's save that save this now

2398
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,560
we're ready to get into the tracing

2399
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,719
so my bill of materials is basically

2400
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:38,239
done for now so let's go ahead and set

2401
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,239
that aside

2402
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:42,960
uh let's see okay people are sharing

2403
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:43,520
links

2404
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,800
for lrc meters that's great

2405
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,920
awesome oh that's not too bad

2406
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,800
that's not that many parts so here's

2407
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:53,679
what i'm going to do

2408
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,440
first is i'm going to rearrange things

2409
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,080
just a little bit

2410
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,159
this chip is clearly important so that

2411
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:02,080
will go in the middle

2412
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,360
and then i'm going to move those other

2413
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,840
parts off to the side

2414
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:09,360
so let's go ahead and start

2415
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,239
so let's go back to the image here

2416
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,960
i'll create a new layer

2417
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:19,440
and let's call this a trace layer

2418
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,920
make sure it is transparent so it's

2419
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:23,600
filled with transparency you all can see

2420
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,040
my screen hopefully

2421
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:29,119
yeah i'm sharing good okay and i'll just

2422
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:33,280
grab a pen and start tracing

2423
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:38,239
um sure why not size one

2424
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:40,959
let's make it

2425
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:47,119
let's try 10. let's get a nicer color

2426
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,920
okay

2427
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,719
should i start with a 7805 maybe i

2428
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:55,600
should

2429
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,040
actually let's start with plus 12.

2430
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,119
that's always a good place to start

2431
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:01,840
so make sure i'm on the trace layer here

2432
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,679
and draw a nice little line here

2433
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:06,800
because this net will be done soon so

2434
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,360
let me grab the connector

2435
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:12,400
here's dcm

2436
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:15,679
and there is a

2437
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,760
there's a nice keyboard shortcut which

2438
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,199
i'm forgetting that will jump you

2439
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,119
directly to that part

2440
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:24,560
if you would ctrl f

2441
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:28,880
cr1 there we go look at that

2442
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,920
is that cr1 i need to look at the board

2443
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,800
no it's crt

2444
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:39,040
cr2 so move

2445
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:43,679
cr2 over here

2446
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:47,199
and let's actually flip this because pin

2447
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,440
one is probably

2448
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,760
sure i'll call that pin one whatever not

2449
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,520
too important

2450
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,719
so that comes in through diode

2451
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:58,639
uh this is ground so i'm just gonna use

2452
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:01,199
a ground symbol here and assume that

2453
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:06,080
that's what it is boom

2454
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:09,119
so that's done so we're here

2455
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:12,239
and now we're on to this plane so this

2456
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:13,199
plane area

2457
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:17,360
here is 12 volts through a diode

2458
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:21,520
and that goes to c2

2459
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:25,040
so let's go and grab c2

2460
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,199
we're with c2 c2 is here so i still

2461
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:30,880
don't know the value of it but again

2462
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,880
that's okay

2463
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,480
so we'll go ahead and put that in we

2464
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,080
don't know where the other end goes but

2465
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:40,880
uh that's that's okay we'll get to that

2466
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:48,239
okay and so continuing on

2467
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:53,520
oh so i did a bunch of things wrong here

2468
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,840
and what clued me in was the fact that

2469
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,080
this is running to

2470
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,000
pin 2 of the 7808 i have the polarity

2471
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,280
of the diode backwards and it looks like

2472
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,679
the silk screen marking

2473
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:11,280
is wrong um

2474
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,440
no the silk screen is correct this is a

2475
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,000
reverse polarity protection diode so

2476
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,480
it's not a series diode

2477
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,360
so let me go ahead and fix that so that

2478
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,480
should be pointing up

2479
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,800
into it and what i've found is actually

2480
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,880
the 12 volt rail

2481
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:31,840
and so this is ground

2482
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:35,600
that was a good catch

2483
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:40,400
okay so that is indeed ground

2484
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,719
and pin one it looks like it goes to a

2485
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:44,639
bunch of circuitry which i will have to

2486
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:46,320
figure out at some point

2487
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,520
so that comes in off of switch

2488
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,960
yeah really what i want to be doing is

2489
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,639
tracing this 12 volt connection because

2490
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:55,119
this port right here is just ground

2491
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:59,840
so in fact i'll just make a copy of this

2492
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,960
and we'll ground that

2493
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:07,119
yeah pin one is often square but not

2494
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:09,440
always

2495
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,159
and diode polarity i'm using the mark

2496
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:14,080
here on the end so that stripe there

2497
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,840
corresponds with the

2498
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,840
cathode of the diode which is that line

2499
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,400
on the symbol

2500
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:24,080
okay so let's look ahead at the bottom

2501
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:24,480
layer

2502
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:28,320
so i'm going to change the transparency

2503
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,440
i don't see this going anywhere

2504
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,960
huh that's really odd that is not what i

2505
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,840
expected to see

2506
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:43,679
yeah this trace doesn't seem to go

2507
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:48,320
anywhere i must be missing something

2508
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,600
well i have the board here physically

2509
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,440
and maybe there's a trace and i just

2510
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,360
can't see where it's going

2511
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:58,560
and so i'm gonna go oh there is a trace

2512
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,560
okay so here's what's going on

2513
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,639
there's a trace that goes up to this dcn

2514
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:06,960
connector here and it hooks around

2515
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,199
and goes to this diode which is cr1

2516
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:15,119
yeah okay that makes sense

2517
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:17,199
so this capacitor is not supposed to be

2518
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:19,119
there and instead

2519
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:23,840
we have cr1

2520
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:26,159
and cr1 goes here so let me go ahead and

2521
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:27,600
rotate that

2522
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,600
i'm hitting g to drag it so it drags the

2523
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:30,960
trace

2524
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,600
all right so that's a series diode and

2525
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,480
that winds up here where this dot is

2526
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,800
now we're back into things okay all

2527
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:39,679
right

2528
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:41,679
this makes sense so this is all plus 12

2529
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:43,760
volts

2530
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,040
and that goes to the input of the

2531
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:47,280
voltage regulator

2532
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,560
you know what i'm going to do i'm going

2533
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:52,800
to use a plus 12 volt net symbol

2534
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:59,520
plus 12 volts we'll use this little flag

2535
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:06,159
great and i'll make a copy of that

2536
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,280
okay now let's see what other components

2537
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,560
are here so there's this other part here

2538
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:15,600
it looks like there's a resistor and

2539
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,199
which resistor was that that was r19 or

2540
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:22,320
r18 one of those two

2541
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:26,400
that's r18 so one end of r18 is plus 12

2542
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,799
volts

2543
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:32,960
there's our 18. see our crystal

2544
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,639
rectifier differentiates from a tube

2545
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:36,719
rectifier or a selenium rectifier

2546
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:38,480
vintage electronics holdover

2547
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,080
all right so that other person was

2548
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,800
correct it is crystal rectifier

2549
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:46,000
wow that's a good one today i learned

2550
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,520
yeah back in the day it would have been

2551
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,520
a vacuum rectifier right

2552
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,239
vacuum tube i guess i probably should

2553
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:54,799
have known that

2554
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:59,600
okay let's make a copy of that

2555
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,440
and that goes to 12 volts i don't know

2556
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:02,639
where the other end goes

2557
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:06,639
yet so it's probably some biased circuit

2558
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:09,119
and then there's c15 there's a bunch of

2559
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:09,920
other parts

2560
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,880
on 12 volts and now that i think about

2561
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,159
it i think this

2562
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:16,639
motorola part runs off of 12 volts so

2563
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:18,639
that's probably all going over there

2564
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:20,159
i don't know what they use that 5 volt

2565
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:21,840
regulator i guess they use 5 volts as

2566
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,119
well

2567
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:25,599
all right

2568
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:28,639
all right so let's go ahead and trace

2569
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:30,239
things out some more so

2570
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:34,718
c15 also goes there

2571
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,719
c15

2572
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:42,400
probably would have been more

2573
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,960
interesting to start from the uh chip

2574
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,600
so i might just do that so after i copy

2575
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,159
this over

2576
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:57,520
oh it goes into a transistor q5 pin 2.

2577
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:03,920
that can't be right is that really the

2578
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:06,320
emitter

2579
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:10,320
let me think about that base collector

2580
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:14,239
emitter hmm

2581
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:16,159
i'm suspicious this is probably the

2582
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:18,719
collector

2583
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,840
so i'm not sure what that transistor

2584
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,119
does but i'm sure it's something

2585
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:24,560
interesting

2586
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,400
the pin numbering i'm not expecting to

2587
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,840
match up

2588
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,600
oh actually you know what this is a pnp

2589
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,760
so i might have gotten it wrong

2590
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:32,960
all right well you know what here's what

2591
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,239
i'm going to do since i'm an impatient

2592
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:36,320
guy i'm going to go back to

2593
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,960
this chip and we'll figure out some

2594
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,600
interesting connections there

2595
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,080
so let's go ahead and look uh is that

2596
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:44,880
pin one

2597
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:48,880
yes it is pin one so pin

2598
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:52,320
four goes up here

2599
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,719
to the output of the five volt regulator

2600
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:58,080
so now we need a five volt flag

2601
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,839
and let's wire that up

2602
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:10,159
i hope you all are doing this on your

2603
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:12,480
board too getting a head start on it

2604
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,679
because

2605
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:15,840
now is the time to ask me questions

2606
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,239
while you have me available

2607
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:19,440
so you don't want to run into a

2608
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:22,080
situation where tomorrow you wake up and

2609
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,679
need to reverse engineer the board the

2610
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:25,760
rest of the way and then get stuck on

2611
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:26,960
something

2612
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,239
except eric's not here for questions

2613
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:31,440
which means you'll have to find me on

2614
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:35,360
twitter or something i don't know

2615
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,960
ah looks like it goes to a bunch of

2616
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:39,360
other parts

2617
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,199
but we've got that trace in so that's

2618
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:42,400
good

2619
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:45,119
uh this plane is ground and that is pin

2620
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:49,839
five so pin five is ground

2621
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,239
let's see if there's a ground symbol i

2622
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:54,560
can steal

2623
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:56,960
great

2624
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:00,719
so that takes care of that

2625
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:02,000
now there might also be ground

2626
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,280
connections on the top layer of the

2627
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:04,480
board

2628
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,239
so that's something we have to watch out

2629
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:07,920
for in fact i may actually have to go in

2630
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:09,360
with a multimeter and buzz out those

2631
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,040
connections

2632
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:12,719
what was that dropping off twitter no no

2633
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:14,800
i'm staying on twitter

2634
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,159
it's awesome to see the process in

2635
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:17,440
action especially when eric is dealing

2636
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:19,920
with the unexpected in real time

2637
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,440
that's what i'm trying to do i'm trying

2638
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,040
to uh

2639
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:27,280
talk about what i'm working on

2640
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:32,480
as i'm working on it eric

2641
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:35,920
yes hi this is sophie i'm just uh

2642
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:39,440
popping in because we are all right hi

2643
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:42,000
it looks like this is going great i'm

2644
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,080
seeing stuff fly by on twitter i wish i

2645
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:44,880
could be here

2646
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,080
this looks like very informative how

2647
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:48,480
late

2648
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:51,520
is this going uh

2649
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,159
we're going to get as far as we can on

2650
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:55,840
this particular circuit board and then

2651
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,920
we're going to wrap things up

2652
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,840
on time so i'll probably do this a

2653
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,440
couple of more minutes

2654
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:04,400
and then we'll uh maybe conclude have a

2655
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,840
little discussion or something and it

2656
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:06,719
should all be

2657
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:10,080
done at 6 30. okay that sounds good

2658
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:12,239
just just checking checking one all

2659
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:13,360
right

2660
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,799
see ya bye

2661
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,400
is she gone now okay great we can get

2662
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,159
back to it

2663
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:27,440
i'm just teasing okay so we need l3 see

2664
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,400
i'm getting in trouble because i'm

2665
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,119
taking too long

2666
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:33,600
but now you're getting the idea of how

2667
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,119
long this sort of thing takes

2668
01:46:35,119 --> 01:46:38,880
in real time uh there's a couple of

2669
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,159
things that i did want to do

2670
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:43,600
so when we hit the uh 620 mark i wanted

2671
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,320
to discuss

2672
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:47,040
this circuit from kind of a top level

2673
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,639
perspective

2674
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:51,280
that goes to pin three and and the

2675
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:52,840
reason is is that there's some really

2676
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:54,159
interesting

2677
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:56,080
pieces of the circuit that based on

2678
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:57,280
experience

2679
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:58,880
i kind of have an inkling of what they

2680
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:02,080
might do already

2681
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,960
and that goes out to r12 is that the

2682
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:05,600
other end of it

2683
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:09,840
no that's the same end

2684
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:12,159
yeah some couple of interesting

2685
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:13,679
observations that i wanted to share with

2686
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:15,840
you

2687
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:20,880
so control f r12 since i already placed

2688
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,840
it

2689
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,600
i can do this for hours and i have done

2690
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:26,960
this for hours

2691
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,440
you know i get music going or i put a

2692
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,440
netflix on in the background

2693
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:34,560
and i just churn through it uh

2694
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,560
i need to put a gap in there those are

2695
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,360
not the same trace

2696
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:42,080
but again i'm just using this to mark uh

2697
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,679
what i've done so far this isn't really

2698
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:46,960
the source of truth for the netlist

2699
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,199
okay so that also goes down to the

2700
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:50,159
trimmer capacitor

2701
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,400
it looks like but i have to look at the

2702
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,920
physical board now because otherwise i

2703
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:56,400
can't tell

2704
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:58,400
yes so it goes to one leg of the trim

2705
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,638
cap

2706
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:04,320
it's going to look super messy but it

2707
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,239
will tidy up soon yes

2708
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:09,840
um so i have a mostly smd focused

2709
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:13,199
uh entirely smd based board um okay

2710
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:15,679
i suspect a lot of traces are going

2711
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:16,400
underneath

2712
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,400
the ics yes um they're like slt

2713
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,719
sorry sopp like 20s and stuff like that

2714
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:23,600
uh-huh sure

2715
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:27,520
and and because it's got a playing

2716
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,760
of like ground play on the other side

2717
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,280
it's hard to shine a light through to

2718
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,320
see ah

2719
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:35,920
yes any recommendation on which

2720
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:39,040
ones to take out first like what would

2721
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,360
be

2722
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:42,880
the best um

2723
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:46,480
order of operation okay so if it's early

2724
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,560
documented and you've got pictures of it

2725
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,080
then it's okay to start removing

2726
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:51,679
components because you know where they

2727
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:52,480
go

2728
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:53,920
when you want to put it back together

2729
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,080
again if if that's what you want to do

2730
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,760
if you don't care about it functioning

2731
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,360
when you're done then

2732
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,040
just go ahead and tear into it but just

2733
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,560
make sure you take lots of pictures

2734
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:03,280
before

2735
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,679
so you know where everything goes i'll

2736
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:07,199
give it a couple more minutes and then

2737
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:08,400
i'll tell you what my overall

2738
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,920
impressions are of the board

2739
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,119
you know what i'm going to do that right

2740
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:12,880
now and then i'm going to open up the

2741
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,000
floor for questions that

2742
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,119
people might be saving up uh so i did

2743
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,800
have a couple of observations

2744
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:22,480
about this the circuit so far

2745
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:25,840
looks really similar to the data sheet

2746
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,840
uh this is the wrong window i wanted to

2747
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,760
pull up the data sheet

2748
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:34,080
here we go and so this schematic right

2749
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:34,800
here

2750
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,560
yeah so you can start to see like here's

2751
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,159
a coil there's a trimmer cap

2752
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:39,920
it's starting to look very very similar

2753
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,760
to the simplified application

2754
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,000
circuit and if i scroll through the data

2755
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
sheet i'll probably see

2756
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,119
a couple of precooked examples

2757
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:50,560
well this one doesn't seem to have any

2758
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,719
but there may be an application note

2759
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:55,119
that goes into more detail but already

2760
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:56,480
some of the connections are starting to

2761
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:57,920
look familiar

2762
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:59,280
yeah so this has something to do with

2763
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:00,719
sound and so what i'm putting together

2764
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:02,880
here is actually the sound circuit

2765
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:05,199
so one observation is that if you've got

2766
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:06,880
a good data sheet for one of the parts

2767
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,000
on your board

2768
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,679
and that's like the sort of focus of the

2769
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:11,599
board the main chip if you will

2770
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:13,760
often you can learn lots of interesting

2771
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,520
things just by reading that data sheet

2772
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,360
and familiar familiarizing yourself with

2773
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,400
it

2774
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,560
another interesting thing to look at on

2775
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,000
the circuit board

2776
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,840
is that they've got some kind of a power

2777
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,440
switching circuit

2778
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:28,000
uh i think it's power switching it might

2779
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,080
not be

2780
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:32,159
yeah this there's a there's a a

2781
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:33,760
transistor in here

2782
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,639
and probably some sort of a series

2783
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:38,400
transistor to limit the current or

2784
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,840
sorry a series resistor to limit the

2785
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,599
current and it goes into what looks like

2786
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:43,920
some kind of a filter

2787
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,760
yeah so that looks almost like a pi

2788
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,920
filter so you've got two inductors

2789
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,639
with capacitors going to ground that

2790
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:52,000
might actually be shutting off

2791
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,840
some video signal coming out from this

2792
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,400
chip just by clamping it to ground

2793
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,719
and then r15 may be some sort of a bias

2794
01:50:58,719 --> 01:51:00,960
adjustment

2795
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,119
and then if we go over here okay this is

2796
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:04,880
what i wanted to look at this looks a

2797
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:07,440
lot like a differential amplifier

2798
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:09,760
uh let me toggle between these two views

2799
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,520
so i can see

2800
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:14,159
yeah it kind of does so there's a

2801
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:15,679
voltage divider up here

2802
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:18,800
made by r4 and r8 that goes from this

2803
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:21,679
connection here to ground and then that

2804
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:22,400
goes into

2805
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,960
the probably the base of this transistor

2806
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,080
here and then you've got an emitter

2807
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,280
transistor here

2808
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,840
the collectors are tied together and so

2809
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,679
that's kind of the classic long tail

2810
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:34,159
pair that you see in a differential

2811
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:35,199
amplifier

2812
01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:36,960
in fact if we go back to the data sheet

2813
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,719
of this part

2814
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:41,199
uh here's a couple examples of some

2815
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:42,320
differential pairs

2816
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,920
so let me zoom in so you can see that so

2817
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,520
there's two transistors

2818
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:47,119
in this case they're sharing an emitter

2819
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:48,880
collection uh

2820
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:51,360
emitter collection connection now here

2821
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,639
it might be the same it might be a

2822
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:53,520
shared emitter

2823
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:55,760
although i'm not sure this is quite

2824
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:56,560
right

2825
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:59,440
based on the pin out yeah these might

2826
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:00,080
actually be

2827
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:03,280
two different amplifiers let's see yeah

2828
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:06,080
so they're sharing the same pen

2829
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,599
on the collector that's what's messing

2830
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:11,199
me up and then that goes into the base

2831
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:12,719
and this space goes in here and that

2832
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:15,040
might be some sort of a follower circuit

2833
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,199
so i'd have to trace it out further to

2834
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:20,000
understand what's going on

2835
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,599
it probably is an amplifier for the

2836
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:23,520
video so we could start from video

2837
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,400
and then kind of go backwards so there's

2838
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:27,679
a resistor to ground that's a

2839
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:30,159
termination resistor

2840
01:52:30,159 --> 01:52:33,119
looks like there's a capacitor here okay

2841
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:35,280
so there's a series coupling cap

2842
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:37,760
and then that goes in here to this

2843
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,520
voltage divider and so that's our bias

2844
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,119
network

2845
01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:44,719
and then it goes here to this transistor

2846
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:46,000
all right so i'm going to have to check

2847
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,560
the pin out for those transistors

2848
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,400
oh i know what's going on i got this

2849
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,000
backwards

2850
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,599
i was assuming that this is a video

2851
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:57,040
output this is actually a video input

2852
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,920
so video from the vcr comes in goes into

2853
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:01,520
the 75 termination

2854
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,159
resistor 75 volt termination goes to the

2855
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:05,119
series cap

2856
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:07,679
then it goes into this amplifier so

2857
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:08,400
there's your

2858
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,080
bias network there and that sets up the

2859
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,000
cue point of the transistor

2860
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,360
that goes into the base of q1 and q1 is

2861
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:18,400
a common emitter amplifier with some

2862
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,480
emitter degeneration and so that

2863
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,000
linearizes it

2864
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,199
and basically controls the gain

2865
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:26,960
and then that goes over through here to

2866
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,320
this circuit i'm not sure what this

2867
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,000
transistor is doing

2868
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,360
it might have something to do with that

2869
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,880
little video enable circuit that we were

2870
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,320
looking at earlier

2871
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,920
i'd have to trace out the schematic all

2872
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:37,599
the way to figure that out

2873
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:39,040
and then trying to follow the signal

2874
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:40,880
chain it goes in here

2875
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,560
and that looks like it might be some

2876
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,560
kind of a follower circuit

2877
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,239
like an emitter follower buffer or

2878
01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:48,639
something so there's a resistor here

2879
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:50,480
that goes to some kind of a power rail

2880
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,920
probably

2881
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:53,520
yeah that's probably a power rail and

2882
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:56,000
then that goes through this lc filter

2883
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,360
and then that probably goes into the

2884
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,520
modulation circuit

2885
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:00,800
yeah so i think that's what we're

2886
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,880
looking at here so we've got about five

2887
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,520
minutes left and i want to use this time

2888
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:07,760
to answer anyone's questions that they

2889
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:09,360
might have

2890
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:11,599
about any of the reverse engineering

2891
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:12,480
that they've gone through

2892
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:15,360
so far in this session i'm going to

2893
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:19,040
scroll back too if nobody speaks up

2894
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:22,000
so i was wondering you mentioned uh the

2895
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,400
soldering parts

2896
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,800
okay what would you be doing like if i

2897
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:27,599
want to assault

2898
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:30,480
disorder my ic is it to look underneath

2899
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:32,400
the faces

2900
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:36,639
to um yes yes so you're desoldering the

2901
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:37,840
part because you want to see

2902
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:40,880
where the traces and vias are underneath

2903
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:42,239
so if you've taken a picture of the back

2904
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:43,679
of the board and you see that there's a

2905
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:44,560
via there

2906
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,639
and you want to know where it goes then

2907
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:48,159
you'll have to remove the chip that's on

2908
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:49,760
the opposite side in order to figure

2909
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:50,080
that

2910
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:52,719
out another way to do it is if you

2911
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:53,840
suspect it connects

2912
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,679
to the chip is you could put the

2913
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:57,520
multimeter on the via

2914
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:58,880
and then put the other terminal of the

2915
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:01,040
multimeter on each of the pins

2916
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:03,679
of the chip in turn and so then when it

2917
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:05,520
beeps when you see zero ohms then you

2918
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,119
know that the trace is connected to that

2919
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:07,920
pin

2920
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:11,040
so in this example here there's a trace

2921
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:13,920
that comes in from the top and it

2922
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,440
disappears underneath the chip

2923
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:18,480
i can't tell where it goes so it could

2924
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:20,639
go to any one of these pins here

2925
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:22,320
and so one of the things i could do is

2926
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:23,840
shine a flashlight at an angle

2927
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:24,880
underneath and try to

2928
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,239
get a glimpse of where it goes

2929
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:28,719
underneath i could also go in with the

2930
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:29,599
multimeter

2931
01:55:29,599 --> 01:55:31,360
and use the technique i described and so

2932
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:32,719
what i would do

2933
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:36,639
is put one multimeter probe on this lead

2934
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:38,080
and then the other i would sort of brush

2935
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,840
it across all the other pins to see

2936
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:42,159
where it triggers

2937
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:44,320
hopefully that answers your question i

2938
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:45,679
routinely look at

2939
01:55:45,679 --> 01:55:47,280
comm tear downs and repair videos for

2940
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,119
mobile phone designs

2941
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:52,080
sometimes i see a dark film yeah so

2942
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,599
sometimes they use that for emi

2943
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:54,639
suppression

2944
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:58,840
and so they use that to absorb uh uh

2945
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:00,159
radiation

2946
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:02,000
okay we've got three minutes left and

2947
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,480
then we have the keynote so

2948
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:07,760
one last question q2 is probably a

2949
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:15,840
switch that cuts off the video yes

2950
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,800
i'm going to scroll back and find

2951
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,719
questions unless someone speaks up

2952
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:23,760
hey eric yes

2953
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,520
um i asked this question a couple times

2954
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,040
but i wanted to hear specifically your

2955
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,080
opinion

2956
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,719
um are there particular vintages or

2957
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:31,679
industries

2958
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:33,440
that this technique just isn't going to

2959
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,760
work very well

2960
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,280
probably so if you're dealing with

2961
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:38,800
vacuum tube equipment that's got all

2962
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,719
sorts of point-to-point wiring then this

2963
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:42,480
is not really the best technique

2964
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:43,840
you could do the bill of materials the

2965
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:45,760
same way but you're just going to have

2966
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,760
to trace wires or spend time

2967
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:49,599
with a multimeter buzzing out all the

2968
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:50,960
connections

2969
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,560
and then i would just draw it up on

2970
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,840
paper you could do a schematic in

2971
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:56,000
kai-cad

2972
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,239
but that would be pretty challenging i

2973
01:56:58,239 --> 01:57:00,239
really appreciate all of you coming

2974
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:02,320
uh this was a really fun time for me it

2975
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,599
reminds me a lot of the

2976
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:06,239
twitch streams that i've been uh doing

2977
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:07,040
recently

2978
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:10,159
so typically on typically friday

2979
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:11,920
afternoons like 4 p.m

2980
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:14,719
pacific time i'll set up a twitch stream

2981
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:17,199
on whatever project i'm working on

2982
01:57:17,199 --> 01:57:18,560
also be sure to follow me on twitter

2983
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:20,400
because that's where i announce

2984
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:23,360
those twitch streams and i really

2985
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:24,800
appreciate all you coming

2986
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:27,920
and uh asking such great questions

2987
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:30,159
and i'm going to go and hang out in the

2988
01:57:30,159 --> 01:57:32,159
uh hacking a chat room so you can ask me

2989
01:57:32,159 --> 01:57:34,480
more questions afterwards

2990
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:37,840
and my twitter handle is at us i just

2991
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:40,080
