2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,820
thank you so much we're here with Andrew

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,400
and Catherine from field-ready and we're

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,020
so excited to dive in a little deeper to

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,600
some of the details around the

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,449
challenges we've developed with them and

7
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:23,130
I think it'll be useful just to get

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,810
started with hopefully an easy question

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,490
which is can you tell us a little bit

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,470
more about field-ready in the work you

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,750
do and you know your organization's

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,410
mission

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,200
thanks and yeah thank you very much for

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,090
including field-ready in the hackaday

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,370
challenges here field-ready is a

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,350
humanitarian disaster relief

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,620
organization which means that the kind

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,760
of work we're doing is with people

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,460
affected by disaster in refugee

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,190
situations working with refugees so

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,750
there are refugees in Bangladesh or

22
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,489
internally displaced people who might

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,650
have been affected by state the recent

24
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,790
cyclone tropical cyclone herald that is

25
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,229
affected half the population of the

26
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,299
Pacific island nation of Vanuatu and

27
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,939
they does a weak recovery process a

28
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,310
rebuilding process for those for those

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,880
communities or longer-term

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,659
reconstruction such as in Nepal after

31
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,900
the 2015 earthquakes there was a there

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,930
is a response but now five years on

33
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,189
there's more work to be done in terms of

34
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:43,820
recovering the people's livelihood still

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,979
and then in Iraq after the conflict

36
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,860
there in particularly with Isis

37
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,290
occupation in the north of the country

38
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,579
try to create jobs and help to create

39
00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:00,200
jobs for young people so that they can

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,450
develop their own businesses create

41
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,010
their own enterprises and

42
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,410
that the those are the sort of

43
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,080
humanitarian purposes that we work for

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,360
our mission really is a little bit

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,180
different it's we're not an the normal

46
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,890
human and cellphone organization if I'm

47
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,890
if there is such a thing what we try to

48
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,930
do is we try to manufacture eight light

49
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,230
in the field what we try to do is to use

50
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,110
all of the capacities and the

51
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,810
technologies the ideas even make a

52
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,770
movement of digital fabrication maker

53
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,880
spaces and we apply them into

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,650
humanitarian relief context

55
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,740
so basically field-ready makes aid

56
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,440
supplies in the field rather than

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,930
shipping them in rather than shipping in

58
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,900
supplies to a disaster zone you can

59
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,490
imagine in perhaps often an earthquake

60
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,380
or a cyclone a lot of the transport

61
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,060
infrastructure in stroyed with lots of

62
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,400
problems with that we try to make for

63
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,370
supplies locally and we find the finding

64
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,310
of that can make the supplies cheaper

65
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,770
faster and better in terms of when

66
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,560
they're finally handed over to people

67
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,910
who've been affected by the disaster by

68
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,709
making by making them locally they can

69
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,300
be cheaper faster and better which means

70
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,880
you can help more people more quickly

71
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,310
more effectively and by using some of

72
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,050
the ideas of the maker movement you can

73
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,330
also create local livelihoods jobs and

74
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,810
help with that recovery I talked about

75
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,150
yeah that's that's for your daddy's

76
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,910
mission to transform the way aid is

77
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,880
supplied in the world thank you I think

78
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,550
that's a really great foundation to get

79
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,489
started talking about some of your

80
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:57,459
current projects and then we'll get into

81
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:00,519
the challenges more specifically so I

82
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,489
know that there's a lot of stuff you

83
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:04,900
guys are currently working on some

84
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,290
things that were definitely affected by

85
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,540
recent events as well so if you could

86
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,230
just brief you briefly explain some of

87
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,910
your current work and then we'll get

88
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,858
into the first challenge well there are

89
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,709
three kinds of work here we do one is

90
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,160
the response activities and whether

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,460
that's to tropical cyclones or to

92
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,730
volcanoes or conflict or earthquakes

93
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,830
mobilizing to actually make supplies and

94
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,470
provide them to the affected people the

95
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,010
second thing that we do a lot of is

96
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,370
capacity-building and quality assurance

97
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,280
almost so trying to support local

98
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,860
manufacturing companies local maker

99
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,110
spaces local entrepreneurs and startups

100
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,170
to help then make eight supplies to help

101
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,600
put us out of a job and to make sure

102
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,380
that some of those some some of those

103
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,270
communities can be more resilient and

104
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,700
provide the aid that they need for

105
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,639
themselves by themselves in future

106
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,130
disaster responses and then the third

107
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,419
thing we do is we try to change the way

108
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,639
that the humanitarian system is working

109
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,260
so there's quite a bit of activity to

110
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,910
influence the aid sector to say you know

111
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,250
what guys making things in

112
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,860
India or China or turkey warehousing

113
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,910
them in Dubai or Copenhagen or Panama

114
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,880
and then shipping them to Fiji to

115
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,110
Bangladesh to Somalia whatever it might

116
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,270
be that's a bit of a crazy way of doing

117
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,940
things why don't we find new ways of

118
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,970
delivering aid trying to transform the

119
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,030
system something that might help some of

120
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,500
the people involved in the the

121
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,970
challenges were putting forward is that

122
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,350
one of the ways we're trying to change

123
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,180
the system as we have published a book

124
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,300
so I'm going to plug the book called

125
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,870
managing humanitarian innovation and a

126
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,490
lot of the information about the way

127
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,470
that we work and some of the tools that

128
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,370
we used to innovate in the middle of

129
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,460
that disaster response to work on

130
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,930
humanitarian innovation which I really

131
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,740
just included in this book sorry over

132
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,389
the course of the challenges in the in

133
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,430
the coming weeks we might be referring

134
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,919
to some of the content in that awesome

135
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,330
and Katherine do you want to say a

136
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,680
little bit about what you're currently

137
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,940
working on in response to the like ovid

138
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,610
crisis and I guess I don't I'd like to

139
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,840
say if I'm talking about what I'm doing

140
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,849
what I'm doing isn't necessarily

141
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,830
representative I was like what you know

142
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,860
everyone but yeah I was supposed to be

143
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,840
starting a position as a mechanical

144
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,979
engineer with the Pacific team in super

145
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:57,460
Fiji on April 1st but got stuck in the

146
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,960
States and since has been kind of

147
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,580
splitting my time between helping

148
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,199
coordinate between all our efforts

149
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,419
globally on the technical side of things

150
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:13,960
and also managing some work that's

151
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,760
happening here in this state we've been

152
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,320
running a partnership with an

153
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,199
organization called Cove in nineteen

154
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,110
shields that started up in the wake of

155
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,039
kovat out of the shuttered scenery

156
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,190
fabrication facility in LA um led by a

157
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,770
woman named Alexandra and so she's

158
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,409
manufacturing and distributing thousands

159
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,520
of shields a day

160
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,740
we are helping her distribute donated

161
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,259
and discounted shields to people who

162
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,639
need them so far we've gotten some

163
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,699
shields to two different hospitals on

164
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,340
two different Native American tribal

165
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,479
lands and then we are going to another

166
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,120
large chunk to an organization that

167
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,860
provides health care for homeless folks

168
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,409
in kind of all over California but

169
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:11,860
mostly in San Francisco and then we've

170
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,530
had a sprinkling of other smaller

171
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,030
donations to some people providing meals

172
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,039
to on house folks and a harm reduction

173
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,080
organization in Portland Oregon

174
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,270
another harm reduction organization in

175
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,880
holder Vella California I think I was

176
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,849
representative I mean over nineteen has

177
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,000
come along in among all of these other

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,208
disasters responsible place around the

179
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:47,950
world we've been manufacturing PPE we've

180
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,959
been manufacturing face shields we've

181
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,370
been manufacture designing and

182
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,130
manufacturing hand-washing facilities

183
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,839
things like that but you know actually

184
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,820
everybody all over the world is suddenly

185
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,980
needy and they're finding that the

186
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,459
traditional supply chains on supplying

187
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,649
so we're beginning to moment to really

188
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,540
ramp up the manufacture of those locally

189
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,990
as part of Tobit 19 right no that's

190
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,060
great I think that gives some good

191
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,839
context for getting into the challenges

192
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,800
and like you've said it's it's

193
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,470
representative of how you guys need to

194
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,899
respond in situations depending on

195
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,610
what's happening and where it's

196
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,980
happening and you know where your people

197
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,990
are and what you have available to you

198
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,480
and really taking advantage of of the

199
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,880
local resources and local connections

200
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,610
there so I think it's a great great

201
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,579
example to get us started so first off

202
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:45,520
we're going to get into the one of the

203
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,920
open call challenges which is the fluid

204
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,470
warmer I think that it would be really

205
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,600
helpful to just

206
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,440
start with sort of you know basic

207
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,700
definition of what a fluid warmer is

208
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,270
what it does and why it's important to

209
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,250
the work that you all do in the field

210
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,830
the fluid warmer yeah so a fluid warmer

211
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,650
is a medical device that heats

212
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,300
intravenous fluids up to body

213
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,280
temperature prior to those fluids being

214
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,710
injected into a patient this is really

215
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,670
important because if you inject a fluid

216
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,800
that's colder than body temperature you

217
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,790
can give a patient severe hypothermia

218
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,320
and it can result in death and by

219
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,970
intravenous fluids these are most

220
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,640
commonly either human blood for a blood

221
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,040
transfusion or IV saline for rehydration

222
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,420
and when there's not unlike a proper

223
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,480
medical device fluid warmer facilities

224
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,600
will still warm the fluids typically

225
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,250
through imprecise methods like

226
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,800
submerging the fluid which is enclosed

227
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,720
in like a plastic disposable into like a

228
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,780
warm water bath and this is really

229
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,060
dangerous for blood transfusions because

230
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,810
if you heat cold blood a couple degrees

231
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,660
too much you'll hemolyzed the blood and

232
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,330
this means that the red blood cells

233
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,420
rupture and if you inject hemolyzed

234
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,000
blood into a patient that can also very

235
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,510
easily

236
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,780
kill kill--uhh patient so without access

237
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,900
to proper fluid warmers blood

238
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,530
transfusions become very dangerous so in

239
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,470
some of the documentation we're looking

240
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,870
at as you know we went back and forth

241
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,450
developing this challenge I remember a

242
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,950
heating time being something that was

243
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,110
seemed to be an important factor and

244
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,030
then also something that we've noted in

245
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,330
the challenges that we'd like it to be

246
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,310
cost-effective so I was hoping we could

247
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,050
dive in a little bit more to those two

248
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,180
factors and explain you know why why

249
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,680
effective solutions would take these

250
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,610
things into account

251
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,800
yeah heating time is really important

252
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,500
typically the way a fluid warmer works

253
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,190
is that

254
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,670
and you take the tube of the IV in that

255
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,730
line and wrap it around a heating

256
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,500
element so the warmer is never actually

257
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,690
in contact with the fluid it it's in

258
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,370
contact with a tube and so from the tube

259
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,530
entering your fluid warmer to the tube

260
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,660
exiting your fluid warmer you need to

261
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,320
keep the fluid up to temperature and

262
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,370
medical facilities have standards for

263
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,210
how quickly they will inject IV fluids

264
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,070
and so you just want to make sure that

265
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,670
at the rate the fluid is passing through

266
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,660
the tubing you know that it gets to to

267
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,780
body temperature in time I'm so sorry

268
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:55,300
heating time comes into play cost yeah

269
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,620
that's important I mean the reason these

270
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,420
facilities don't have fluid warmers to

271
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,950
begin with is generally a lack of

272
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,750
resources so if we're making something

273
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,520
on the ground it has to be affordable

274
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,290
and scalable and to that point also the

275
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,060
the design needs to be made out of like

276
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,190
easily source parts and it also needs to

277
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,040
be designed such that if you find

278
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,380
different parts in different locations

279
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,900
you can easily adapt the design or the

280
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,070
code or the electronics to accommodate

281
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,780
whatever components it is you're able to

282
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,820
source if you're making these in the

283
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,950
field and one thing I'd say more

284
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,600
important than any of the three things I

285
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,070
just mentioned is safety field-ready

286
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,510
doesn't usually delve into medical

287
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,500
devices that can kill a person but a

288
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,940
fluid warm air is a device that if it's

289
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,740
poorly designed and that the safety

290
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,089
features aren't all the way there and

291
00:13:55,089 --> 00:14:00,160
it's not yeah not up to par like it can

292
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,350
kill a person and that is unacceptable

293
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,260
obviously so I chase safety features

294
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,890
should absolutely be so as a for most of

295
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,890
anyone thinking about this one of the

296
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,480
other IDs

297
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,019
turns developed or started to develop a

298
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,199
fluid warmer open-source fluid warmer I

299
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,430
believe and did a whole in-depth report

300
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,680
on it which we're gonna sort of

301
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,540
summarize and make available to the

302
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,639
community and we just wanted to I wanted

303
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,910
to go over sort of on the call what were

304
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,730
some of the findings I know that there

305
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,399
were there's a lot of great research in

306
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,690
there that covers some of the things we

307
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,360
just mentioned the heat time sort of the

308
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,519
process of how it actually works and how

309
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,459
to do accomplish those things and she

310
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,740
also has some great case studies are

311
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,449
sort of benchmark examples but I know

312
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,339
that there were also some some feedback

313
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,480
from field ready team members sort of in

314
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,029
the field of how this could be improved

315
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:11,310
where there are any specific things you

316
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,649
could highlight one of the lessons about

317
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,410
what could be improved on the machine is

318
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,080
on the blood warmer device is

319
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,579
[Music]

320
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:27,060
essentially the user aspect of it to

321
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,290
make it a lot more straightforward for

322
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,410
the operators to use because we would be

323
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,300
introducing these into context where

324
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,339
perhaps they haven't had them before and

325
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,649
they haven't used these sorts of devices

326
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:47,550
so they're not necessarily going to be

327
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,130
very experienced on it the training that

328
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,339
might be available would probably often

329
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,940
be a virtual training and there isn't a

330
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,010
great deal of ways to sort of experiment

331
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:06,630
one of the one of the you know to

332
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,490
practice rather than experiment I think

333
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,040
actually should say to practice on using

334
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,949
the device before you use it on a real

335
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:15,959
patient so if there's any sort of

336
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,839
feedback mechanisms that can be relied

337
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,180
upon to help provide that training it

338
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,760
could be built into the design of the

339
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,610
product that is probably worth paying

340
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,240
the extra cost for

341
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,180
from the the work that has already been

342
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,470
done I

343
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,990
what's noted in that thesis of needing

344
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,670
the most work and definitely where the

345
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,240
least work went into the start is the

346
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,490
electronic system and the Arduino

347
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,950
controlling that and that's really where

348
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,570
all the safety features happen to I

349
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:56,350
think the code as is is is very messy

350
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:02,110
and hard to follow so I think a deeper

351
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,010
dive improving the electronic system

352
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,679
she clearly put a lot of time into the

353
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,559
kind of mechanical design of how it all

354
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,760
fits together and I'm sure there's room

355
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,679
for improvement there but I think

356
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:16,390
there's a lot of room for improvement in

357
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,179
the electronic so the the other open

358
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:20,709
call challenges we've developed with

359
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:21,369
field-ready

360
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:25,480
are in the form of some sort of tools

361
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,950
that could really come into play in the

362
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,290
in the field and also in some of the

363
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,030
maker spaces this grew out a

364
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,850
conversation with some of the team

365
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,179
members at a makerspace and I'm really

366
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,290
excited about these because I think

367
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,260
they're gonna really be a relatable for

368
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,030
a lot of our community and also I could

369
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,309
see us wanting them at design lab at all

370
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:51,490
kinds of places so I I think these have

371
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,790
a lot of like so the first one being

372
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,490
versatile heat sealer and welder and

373
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,580
then the other one being a a UV cure

374
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,080
wand I know that there are some

375
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,990
interesting examples you guys mentioned

376
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,850
when we're developing these challenges

377
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,150
that could currently be addressed with

378
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,950
these sorts of tools so I think that'd

379
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,470
be a great place to start just to cover

380
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:22,809
I know there was a sealing sanitary bags

381
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:25,240
for equipment was one and so maybe we

382
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,350
can start with some of those examples

383
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,360
and then get into more of where the

384
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,350
inspiration for this challenge came yeah

385
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,150
I'm the heat sealer front some immediate

386
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,140
thoughts for applications would be

387
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,290
package

388
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,680
so kind of you know we make items and we

389
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,660
have to distribute them and whether

390
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,970
they're healthcare medical device items

391
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,510
or items in other sectors we want them

392
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,850
to be clean when we distribute them so

393
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,620
kind of versatile heat sealer where you

394
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,240
know you could wrap something in plastic

395
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,740
and then and get a seal without

396
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,510
something that's quick and and allows

397
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,950
you to package something in a sterile

398
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:15,600
way is one really quick idea I know also

399
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,250
thinking about in the wake of a ovid we

400
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,720
were looking at producing medical

401
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,240
isolation gowns and sewing can be slow

402
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,060
if we're talking like maker space scale

403
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,570
production not automated textile factory

404
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,850
I'm sewing each and every gown can be

405
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,370
very slow so we were kind of looking at

406
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,020
some of the DIY stuff where people were

407
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,780
basically using mic hair straighteners

408
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,920
to plastic weld and so I think that it

409
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:57,370
could be really useful to to be able to

410
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,070
weld soft plastics we also have an

411
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,650
intubation box that was developed in

412
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,890
Fiji that it would be useful to have

413
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,750
something like this for and so something

414
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,490
that's first a towel that has some

415
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,170
adjustability to it where you know you

416
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,660
can dial it up if you're trying to seal

417
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,760
and well thick plastic but if you're

418
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,050
trying to use like a really thin plastic

419
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,790
for packaging you can dial it back

420
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,150
something that can allow you to not

421
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,270
necessarily be doing it at desktop but

422
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,770
standing up basically like we work with

423
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,600
all sorts of different sizes and shapes

424
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,000
and products and materials so

425
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,670
versatility is key so this one is more

426
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,250
of like a pie in the sky idea not so

427
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,800
much coming out of a you know we would

428
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,250
use this tomorrow if we had it where's

429
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,440
the heat sealer is very much it we would

430
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,930
use this tomorrow if we had it but UV

431
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,730
cure is just a really powerful tool for

432
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,210
prototyping and

433
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,659
vacations commonly used in medical

434
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:02,309
devices aerospace automotive but it

435
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:06,700
allows you to adhere a lot of different

436
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,529
materials to each other some materials

437
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:11,260
that are with traditional adhesives very

438
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,210
hard to get to bond to each other so

439
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,640
like metal on plastic for instance and

440
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,270
it allows you to have fluid tight bonds

441
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,390
to which can be really helpful in

442
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,850
medical devices or kind of wash

443
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,010
applications and anytime you're moving

444
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,520
fluid basically just something we have

445
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,640
an interest in sometimes I think that

446
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,830
covers it and I think that again we

447
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,980
wanted to reiterate that user

448
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,140
friendliness and safety and

449
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,309
affordability will be crucial to all of

450
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:51,100
these entries and to the proposed

451
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,070
solutions in these spaces I think again

452
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,909
as you mentioned this has to do with the

453
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:00,880
variety of sort of applications the

454
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,039
people that might be using and

455
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,679
implementing these these methods or

456
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,179
tools or or devices whether they're

457
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:13,690
field-ready stuff or they're people that

458
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,279
are being trained by field ready staff

459
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,909
or people that are you know have picked

460
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:21,399
up this idea and are taking it to their

461
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:28,270
local facility to implement so I think

462
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,039
unless there was other things around

463
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,919
those you guys wanted to mention we can

464
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,120
wrap up with the the dream team

465
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,610
challenge what maybe just one quick note

466
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,110
on the safety for these kind of lab

467
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,649
makerspace tools it'd be awesome if this

468
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:46,480
emissions came with some sort of risk

469
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,240
analysis of you know what might be some

470
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,990
modes of failure and how dangerous is it

471
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,270
to the operator and if and if the

472
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,899
designs of you know something that could

473
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:01,029
be shared more the intention with

474
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,409
everything that feels that it does is

475
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:04,120
that we share all of our designs openly

476
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,600
so that anyone can replicate them we put

477
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,860
risk notices

478
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,890
on some of our equipment some of our

479
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,350
designs to say you know if this isn't

480
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,790
made right and it fails that there could

481
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,150
be very severe severe consequences to

482
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,830
life or to help for whatever it might be

483
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,500
so make sure you make it rice and these

484
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,070
are the testing steps and all of that

485
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,760
but in those in that risk analysis when

486
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,170
you're looking at the UV ones or the

487
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,960
heat sealer also think about the health

488
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,540
and safety of the makers making it so

489
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,910
you know at this step what you need to

490
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,070
be doing is making sure that you know

491
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:53,740
you're wearing glasses because you know

492
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,120
safety goggles because you're going to

493
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,470
be cutting wire or you know wearing to

494
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,820
venue in there well-ventilated space

495
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,169
because you're going to be melting

496
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:04,600
plastic whatever yeah I think that's

497
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,870
actually a really perfect segue into the

498
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,809
Dream Team challenge the discussion of

499
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:13,270
sort of risk assessment and quality

500
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,120
control and again getting back to the

501
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,799
complications and challenges around

502
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:21,150
distributed fabrication and sort of

503
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,620
delivery of these these tools and

504
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,260
devices so so yeah we're gonna get into

505
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,630
the the Dream Team challenge this will

506
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,580
be this is something we put together

507
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,510
with field-ready with a dream team of

508
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,330
three engineers designers makers

509
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,600
thinkers in mind who will dedicate two

510
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,980
months to a of engineering sprint to

511
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,130
come up with a solution for this so what

512
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,740
we've come up with is we're looking for

513
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,510
a means of quality control that remotely

514
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,880
tracks and evaluate solutions protects

515
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,740
consumers and ensures a roadmap for

516
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,390
reporting and repair I think there were

517
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,820
sort of a few different anecdotes and

518
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,150
case study examples that you know again

519
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,059
we'll have listed online but maybe you

520
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:12,190
guys could share a few of those just to

521
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,630
paint the picture a little more the

522
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:17,740
inspiration for this challenge right you

523
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,160
know appeared of course with some of the

524
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,260
very first things that we

525
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,720
so one of the first things we ever made

526
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,380
as an organization were these things if

527
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,870
umbilical cord clamps that are to go on

528
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,580
the umbilical cord of newborn babies and

529
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,350
these are this is a 3d printed design it

530
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,899
was developed by one of our co-founders

531
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,049
in Haiti for clinics in 80 and it's

532
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:50,880
quite small as you can probably tell but

533
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,490
you know it really

534
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:59,260
a question of you know for us at the

535
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,750
time it was about how do we get our logo

536
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:07,000
on like so that if more we're needed

537
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,559
people know where to go to get it so

538
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,390
they can go to our website get the

539
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,950
design and make more i logo on it so

540
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,200
that if something goes wrong with this

541
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,929
like a clip doesn't work it doesn't

542
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:25,780
close properly they can report a fault

543
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:31,080
to us and we'll send them a new one or

544
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,370
you know I think as we've grown as an

545
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,260
organization that we've devote more and

546
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,140
more product more of these items have

547
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,390
been distributed distributed we share

548
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,100
all that all of our designs openly

549
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,550
online knowing which ones were made by

550
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:52,210
us using our design knowing which ones

551
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,570
were made by other people using an art

552
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,500
design and knowing which ones

553
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,640
[Music]

554
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,380
modifications of our design so our you

555
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,630
know over time to make that more of a

556
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,640
science and less of an art if you look

557
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,830
at the part of the inspiration is also

558
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,850
the future of the maker movement I mean

559
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,300
the maker movement and maker space is

560
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,620
the beginning to inform thinking about

561
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,960
what a new kind of manufacturing might

562
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,809
be localized manufacturing as a poster

563
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:27,190
that continually sort of centralizing

564
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,030
globalized manufacturing that we've had

565
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,230
ever since the bless' Industrial

566
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,260
Revolution if we're beginning to do

567
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,120
distributed manufacturing the big issue

568
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,120
is really about distributed quality

569
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,190
control and particularly for some of the

570
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,650
devices that we're making

571
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,650
often safety-critical in low resource

572
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,700
settings where perhaps quality control

573
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,760
or the expertise isn't there because

574
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,410
they're making lots of different things

575
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,170
in a day rather than the same thing over

576
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,730
and over and over again and you get that

577
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,330
experience that way so it's really about

578
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,970
how do we you know in the future where

579
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:07,900
we have massive

580
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,480
there's a small manufacturers making

581
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,720
lots of different things every day what

582
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,000
kind of system can we have to have

583
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,390
consumer protection so that we can meet

584
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,520
some of the standards that have

585
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,870
developed in the mainstream

586
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,010
manufacturing world a fairly basic form

587
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,480
of consumer protection there's knowing

588
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,930
who the manufacturer is and so labeling

589
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,090
ubiquitous you know on every mug on

590
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,320
every gadget not quite on every spare

591
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,730
part or internal components but close

592
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:50,800
for labeling serial numbers that allow

593
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,620
you to know which production run that

594
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,809
came off or or also you have some kind

595
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:04,740
of you know in some cases tracking

596
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,510
capabilities you know that a particular

597
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,090
batch of distribution went to that

598
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,370
location or even you know some tracking

599
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,230
potential you know in the in the device

600
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:22,630
itself so so we might imagine and I've

601
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,030
got some explained some scenarios you

602
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,960
might imagine you know myself visiting a

603
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,170
refugee camp in northern Iraq and

604
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:38,370
looking at the supplies you hand out

605
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:43,840
looking at I don't know this finger

606
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,270
brace a 3d printed finger brace and

607
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,790
trying to work out you know if that

608
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,300
needs to be replaced who can I go to to

609
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,950
replace it well actually there's the

610
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,260
manufacturer detail there I can track

611
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,750
that back to somebody trying to work out

612
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,620
if it's a field-ready design it really

613
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,600
is a question of accountability in

614
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,210
helping to enforce quality quality

615
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,919
assurance it's

616
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:16,720
quite a so this design challenge is

617
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,359
quite a big challenge for us if if there

618
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:25,960
was a simple solution we'd be doing it

619
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,609
already but the you know so we're doing

620
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:33,850
things like yeah spray-painting our logo

621
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,739
on that on the gadgets that we make

622
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:40,269
there's a big enough to do that with we

623
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:45,970
often but we might a simple number into

624
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,980
it but then we need the backend system

625
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,350
to track that so that you know we have

626
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,960
some obviously data systems in the

627
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,399
organization that allows us to track

628
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,989
these sorts of things but for the

629
00:30:58,989 --> 00:31:01,480
purposes of this challenge assume a

630
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,859
blank sheet of paper and you know if

631
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:09,249
it's if there are solutions like spray

632
00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:12,759
paints or barcodes or serial numbers or

633
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:19,179
QR codes or I had no RFID tags or really

634
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,279
have a think about what might work but

635
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,980
you have to think about things solutions

636
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,960
that could work with small clamps like

637
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,169
this so solutions that might be now an

638
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:35,109
entire toilet latrine unit that gets

639
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:38,950
shipped out to earth to a refugee camp

640
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,690
within there's some electronics units

641
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,419
and plastic things you know furniture

642
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:46,029
made out of wood or old pallets or

643
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,299
something what can we do to kind of

644
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:50,739
track each of those and give some

645
00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:52,629
accountability for what we made to the

646
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:55,029
people that were trying to help yeah and

647
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:58,629
I think that actually that sort of flows

648
00:31:58,629 --> 00:32:00,249
right into the next question of some of

649
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:03,570
the skills you think might be needed by

650
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:07,359
applicants to this dream team you've

651
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,299
described a little bit about back-end

652
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:12,009
systems on and to be integrated and

653
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:13,690
things like that again I know we don't

654
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,570
want to put too many constraints on it

655
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:20,080
but I think definitely the biggest thing

656
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,210
I feel like is you know an open problem

657
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:25,730
saw

658
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,270
kind of thinker who can really try to

659
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,580
wrap their head around this because it's

660
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,250
a like you said sort of a complex

661
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,400
challenge with lots of moving parts and

662
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,470
needs a dynamic solution that might

663
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:48,430
incorporate some physical hardware or

664
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:53,480
method or you know process and some data

665
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,490
logging and maybe some documentation or

666
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,640
maybe it's a magical tool that puts that

667
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,430
all into one so but if there are any

668
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,380
skills specifically you wanted to

669
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,700
mention that you think would be useful

670
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,130
throw those out there something that I

671
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,930
think would be really helpful for at

672
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,600
least one team member to have is a

673
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,510
background in quality control somehow

674
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,490
somebody who who's worked somewhere and

675
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,500
has some familiarity with standards

676
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,810
within quality control I think could

677
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:29,750
give some really good insights into what

678
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,180
we might want to incorporate I don't

679
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,130
think that's a mandatory but I think it

680
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,440
could be a really really powerful thing

681
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,780
on the team I think there could be

682
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:46,580
something interesting with AI here maybe

683
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,440
not that might be too high-tech but

684
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,300
somebody who maybe has thought about AI

685
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,950
and beyond that yeah I think just kind

686
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,250
of a Renaissance person kind of general

687
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,950
a little bit of a mechanical a little

688
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,450
bit of electrical a little bit of

689
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:07,220
software yeah luckily I think there's a

690
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,570
lot of those kinds of people in our

691
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,310
community and I think that's a great

692
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,050
point about the experience with quality

693
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,690
quality control Quality Assurance and I

694
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,400
think that that looks a lot of different

695
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,570
ways a lot of different industries so

696
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,100
any sort of standards you're familiar

697
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,070
with you know sort of at least a gateway

698
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,699
into what it takes to set up standards

699
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,770
or a process like that so I think that's

700
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,929
an excellent point

701
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,250
awesome I think we've pretty much

702
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,949
covered a lot of the constraints to this

703
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,570
challenge

704
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,190
I don't know if there was anything else

705
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,600
you wanted to mention there

706
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,840
the constraints are that it's this is

707
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,070
something we need to be able to use a

708
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,330
field ready already

709
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:55,239
we work in Fiji Vanuatu Philippines

710
00:34:55,239 --> 00:35:00,980
Bangladesh Nepal Iraq Syria Jordan

711
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:07,490
Turkey Kenya Uganda soon when we've

712
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,250
worked in US Virgin Islands and Haiti

713
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:15,800
and you know the Columbia you know we

714
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,030
were quite

715
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,660
International which means lots of

716
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,910
different languages which means anything

717
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,369
that means that we don't have to deal

718
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:32,930
with language might be beneficial we

719
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,660
deal with lots of different types of

720
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,140
access so perhaps not everyone will have

721
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,770
a smartphone to use a qre our teams do

722
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:45,940
that perhaps some of the makers that we

723
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,140
would work with you know someone else

724
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:52,250
takes the design or a plight client that

725
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,480
we we've made you know and they produce

726
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,850
that maybe you know they'll have a

727
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,470
laptop and a 3d printer but they might

728
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,859
not have a smartphone or something so

729
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:07,850
it's almost thinking beyond a constraint

730
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:11,300
a sort of removal processive kind of you

731
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,770
know I'm not just thinking about kind of

732
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,320
attaching field-ready logo to things but

733
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,580
how would we do this kind of labeling

734
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,750
and tracking and Quality Assurance

735
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:27,140
customer protection almost within the

736
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,190
maker movement generally where you know

737
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,100
feedback can be can go from a user of

738
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,380
something that should be made in a local

739
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,619
makerspace to the person that made that

740
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:41,570
thing to the person that originally

741
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,680
designed that thing along along that

742
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:53,470
path yeah so it's I think

743
00:36:54,140 --> 00:37:00,920
I would say a constraint is that for if

744
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,019
we want lots of organizations to try and

745
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:04,490
adopt this and filter these in a

746
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:08,180
position to be able to encourage that to

747
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,809
adopt a similar approach to the solution

748
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:13,670
that might come out of this we have to

749
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,440
think about the integrity of that data

750
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,619
and how the data is managed if there is

751
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:20,630
a sort of back-end IT system that

752
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:26,710
manages it all and and recognize that

753
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,529
you know that will need maintenance ISBN

754
00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:33,619
numbers on you know our book has an ISDN

755
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:36,680
number no you can scan that on your

756
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,480
phone and it will give you the answer

757
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,069
because as a back-end database that

758
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:43,940
drives that sort of thing so thinking

759
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,710
about some of the the maintenance of

760
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,240
those systems whether it would

761
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,859
potentially be private information that

762
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:51,980
can reside in your own Syst internal

763
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,420
company system or whether you want

764
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:56,950
something much broader that's public

765
00:37:57,369 --> 00:37:59,680
yeah there's a lot to play with in

766
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,819
charge that's why we're looking for a

767
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:04,279
dream team to work on it I'm so excited

768
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:06,529
to see sort of you know what the

769
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:10,640
hackaday community is going to bring

770
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,680
forth and just to get these challenges

771
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,019
out there and get everyone's get

772
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:18,049
everyone's input and super appreciative

773
00:38:18,049 --> 00:38:21,069
that you all are dedicating your time to

774
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:23,480
continuing to answer our questions to

775
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,700
put these challenges together we know

776
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,319
that you're very busy so we appreciate

777
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:31,069
it and excited to have Katherine's on

778
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:33,440
board as a mentor and Andrew available

779
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,000
throughout to ask questions and things

780
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,630
so I'm sure this will inspire even more

781
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,410
conversation and questions from the

782
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:43,279
community so thank you and excited to

783
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,829
get to launch now we're very excited too

784
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:50,480
and we can you know we've been waiting

785
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,970
for these things further for these sorts

786
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,380
of design challenges eat sort of

787
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,799
opportunities it's important to us

788
00:38:57,799 --> 00:39:00,710
because whilst design is part of what we

789
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,750
do it feel ready if we're designing

790
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,250
things if we're trying to solve

791
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,960
difficult technical problems we're not

792
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,340
making things without making things

793
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,310
so you know what this is giving us the

794
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:15,580
opportunity to develop solutions that we

795
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,800
can use in the field in lots of

796
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,500
different disaster zones the day after

797
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,910
that they're ready we can try those

798
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,770
potentially throughout the design

799
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,740
process as we go with our field teams

800
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,500
and the maker spaces that they operate

801
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,820
trying some of these things but I think

802
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,560
it's you know you know it wouldn't it be

803
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,250
great if the dream teams sort of a

804
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,800
tracking system could go on to the heat

805
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,710
sealers and the UV cure ones and to the

806
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,540
blood warmers into the umbilical cord

807
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,670
clamps in search and rescue air bags and

808
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,410
the latrine slabs and all of the other

809
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,770
things that we make and that we would

810
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,420
use those tools the people are

811
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,990
developing as well to be able to make so

812
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,970
that we can begin to really kind of

813
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,250
compete with the mainstream

814
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,980
manufacturing way of doing things to

815
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,530
help people who are often at the very

816
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:13,440
very far end of globalized supply chains
