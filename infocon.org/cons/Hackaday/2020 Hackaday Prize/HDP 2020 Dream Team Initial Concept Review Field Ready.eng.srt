we're so excited to tell you more

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
about the dream team program this is the

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
first time we're doing this for the 2020

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,559
hackaday prize

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,199
we essentially recruited top talent for

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,120
our non-profit partners

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,438
so to help them solve one of their

23
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,960
challenges during a two-month

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,240
engineering sprint

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,520
so we're going to tell you more about

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,439
the innovators we've selected the field

27
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,080
ready dream

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,640
team and the challenge that they are

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840
participating in

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,439
over the last few weeks and will be for

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,119
the next two months

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,640
but before we get too far into that i

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,320
want to introduce our

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,000
panelists we have joining us today

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
andrew lamb global innovation

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,880
lead for field ready and kat hebson an

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,400
engineer for field ready

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,880
they've been so incredibly generous with

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,320
their time

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,000
mentoring our dream team members and

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,159
really giving feedback and

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,520
giving them more information on the

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,680
challenge as we go uh

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,759
and i also want to give a huge thank you

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,200
of course to our sponsors who have made

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,880
this all possible this year

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,159
supply frame digi-key microchip and arm

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,759
without them none of this would be

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,000
possible and without further

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,320
ado i'd like to pass it off to giovanni

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
salinas our product development engineer

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,079
who has been project managing

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,240
our dream teams for the last few weeks

54
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,360
he's going to give you a little more

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,640
context on

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
this specific field ready dream team

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
challenge and then introduce you all

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
to our dream team members

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
thank you magenta hello everyone

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
i'm really happy to be here today for

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,840
the first

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,319
abstract and concept review for the

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,160
dream team challenge

64
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,840
the feel ready team includes misha

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,879
in jaipur india tom in

66
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,319
london england and antonio in chiapas

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,519
mexico

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,800
hi guys and it's great to see you here

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,080
so the fuel ready challenge asks the

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,280
team to design

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,239
a means of quality control that remotely

72
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:46,959
tracks

73
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,440
and evaluates solutions protects

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,840
consumers and provides a roadmap

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,280
for reporting and repair in other words

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
we are designing not only a physical

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,120
solution but a system

78
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
that will allow field ready and all the

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,840
stakeholders

80
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,519
um you know track the products that are

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,560
manufactured

82
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,120
and eventually deployed in areas where

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
quality control is a challenge

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,680
such as war-torn regions or natural

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
natural disaster zones

86
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,959
during this first three weeks the team

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,440
has done a lot of research in the field

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,760
and started brainstorming potential

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,640
systems

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,560
so the idea of today's meeting with

91
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
andrew and catherine

92
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
is to present the results of this

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,519
research and

94
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,319
start discussing our first ideas andrew

95
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,080
and catherine we can't thank you enough

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,040
for

97
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,640
being here today and we're looking

98
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
forward to hearing your feedback

99
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,080
so without further ado i'll pass it on

100
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,680
to the team

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,959
giovanni thank you for that introduction

102
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,480
i'm going to dive straight into the

103
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,000
presentation and

104
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,519
this is our abstract design report

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,360
so the very first thing that we did when

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,879
we came to this challenge

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,280
was identify the brief that we've been

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,680
given and really bring it back to

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,040
the core of what we were working on and

110
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,720
after extensive thought and

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,079
communication with the

112
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,720
field ready team we developed this how

113
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,918
might we statement

114
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,918
so we are asking ourselves how might we

115
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,240
create solutions to evaluate and improve

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,120
quad product

117
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,000
quality within field ready but this is

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,680
still relatively broad so we broke it

119
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,080
down

120
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,360
into three further subsections

121
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,840
first how do we build a culture of

122
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,800
documentation

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
testing and quality assurance within

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,840
field ready

125
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
to ensure that all of their products

126
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,560
come out extremely high quality and to

127
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,199
make sure that consumers can trust the

128
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,720
products that they receive from field

129
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,400
ready

130
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,840
secondly how do we build new methods and

131
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,919
mechanisms for field ready to receive

132
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,360
user feedback

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
for example if you're a user in the

134
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,440
field using a field ready product

135
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,919
and it fails or if it works really well

136
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,360
and you need a replacement

137
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,400
and you need further products um

138
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,479
how exactly do you go about doing that

139
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,680
so

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,600
we're we've explored different ways of

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,759
facilitating the communication between

142
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,919
field ready and their users

143
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,560
and thirdly we wanted to back up these

144
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,400
first two sections with a robust

145
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,600
labeling system

146
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,960
and this is really a process of

147
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,639
experimentation for us

148
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,320
because field ready has a very diverse

149
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,960
array of products as you'll see later

150
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,600
and so the solutions that we explore

151
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,199
need to be as diverse as

152
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,280
their um product catalog

153
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,840
so next up we evaluated the requirements

154
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,360
for our solution

155
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,560
now this was done in part by analyzing

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,600
field ready's research and website but

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,960
also through conversations with

158
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,720
field-ready employees including cat

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,680
and andrew who are very kind to give us

160
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,120
their time

161
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,360
so we came up with the following list of

162
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
requirements

163
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,039
first and foremost whatever solution we

164
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,960
develop it needs to be simple

165
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,880
because a solution which isn't simple

166
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,400
won't become adopted

167
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
and there's no value in producing a

168
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,639
solution which doesn't get used

169
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,919
so above all else we need to make sure

170
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,479
that

171
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,600
whatever we created was simple

172
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,720
next up it needed to be affordable field

173
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
ready produce a large number of products

174
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,319
and it's important that

175
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,039
it that whatever solution we create is

176
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,319
applicable to all of them

177
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,840
including the extremely low cost 3d

178
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,759
printed or injection molded single-use

179
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,280
parts as well as

180
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,080
slightly higher cost larger products

181
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,880
like latrines

182
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,520
thirdly as i mentioned field ready's

183
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,280
products come in all shapes and sizes

184
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,639
and we needed to make sure that the

185
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,560
solution would work from anything from

186
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,400
like a 3d printed clamp

187
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,800
this big to as i said like a latrine

188
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,919
we also need to make sure that the um

189
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,080
solutions were material agnostic because

190
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,919
field ready design and build products

191
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,160
with a wide variety of

192
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,360
um with a wide variety of materials

193
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
including concrete

194
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,039
plastics wood and others

195
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,319
we needed to make sure that it was

196
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,319
language free because field readies

197
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,560
end users exist in a wide variety of

198
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,080
different locales and we can't

199
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,319
depend upon any of them using all of

200
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,479
them using the same language

201
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,759
we also needed to make sure that it

202
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,840
didn't increase manufacturing time

203
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,759
because field ready's manufacturing time

204
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,599
determines how many products they can

205
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,360
manufacture and how many end users they

206
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,120
can support in the field

207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,440
and finally it needed to support robust

208
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
inspection and validation and

209
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,919
verification of their products

210
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,520
so with all of those in mind we

211
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,120
developed these four goals

212
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,440
we needed to ensure coherent product

213
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,639
documentation

214
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,440
consistent product validation we needed

215
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,879
to make sure that the user

216
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,960
the information and interfaces that we

217
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,639
developed were user-centered

218
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,199
and really built with the user user in

219
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:03,919
mind

220
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,240
and we needed to create and maintain a

221
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
culture of testing and risk assessment

222
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,240
to ensure consumer protection

223
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,080
i'll just end now with the project

224
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,280
timeline

225
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,199
so we spent the first two weeks

226
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,560
researching our project

227
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,800
and right now we're in the middle of a

228
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
the concept development phase

229
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
we'll take the feedback from this

230
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,080
presentation forward for a couple

231
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,639
of days and refine the concepts which

232
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,160
we'll show you later

233
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,599
and then we'll go into a design and

234
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,200
engineering sprint

235
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,958
before uh conducting a mid-process test

236
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,679
um again re-evaluating based on the

237
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,360
results of that test

238
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,760
and then going back into the design

239
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,680
phase and conducting a final test

240
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,880
um in weeks nine and ten

241
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,800
cool over to you antonio

242
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,560
thank you tom hello everyone this is

243
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,880
antonio from mexico

244
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,880
well i i will explain our

245
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,560
methods of research and just to

246
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,399
simplify these processes

247
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,000
we identify we know that

248
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
all other activities in in floridi are

249
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,480
about

250
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,040
humans interacting with digital and

251
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,720
digital informational feed

252
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,160
and physical objects

253
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,440
and then by that we we are trying to

254
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,160
understand

255
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,360
what's the information flow in the pure

256
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,040
radio organization

257
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,120
and um this is a like a fierce uh

258
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,839
site of that mapping of the information

259
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,399
and

260
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,640
objects and with the different

261
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,120
personas or users involved in their

262
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,320
processes

263
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,000
and um the the first stage

264
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,120
we identify is the design and upload

265
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,800
process that he already makes

266
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,240
and the second one is uh

267
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
probably the how the client requires a

268
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,839
specific design for the for a specific

269
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,399
location

270
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,680
and then the how this order

271
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,880
uh it's goes from the

272
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,839
from field ready to the manufacturer and

273
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,519
yeah and then um we need to

274
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,800
uh also know how the manufacturer

275
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,760
interacts

276
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,560
with the uh requirements all the

277
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,200
information that they they need to

278
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,399
use in order to produce the expected

279
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,200
product

280
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,079
and then we also have to know how the

281
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,800
manufacturer delivers these products to

282
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,519
the

283
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,399
client or the end users in some other

284
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,519
scenarios

285
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,240
and uh in if this is the case that the

286
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,200
there is a partner ngo and they are the

287
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,760
ones that

288
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,800
deliver this or distribute those

289
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,440
products to the end users we need to

290
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,640
also make sure

291
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,839
to map these these processes and

292
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,760
yes um then another important point we

293
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,839
need to

294
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,320
understand is how the product ends

295
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,320
office life like uh

296
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,360
what happens after the product is used

297
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,480
and yes

298
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,880
so in this this process

299
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,320
we identified some personas

300
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,200
and as this is a user-centered research

301
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,720
process and

302
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,320
we try to synthesize

303
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,560
all the people that is involved in their

304
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,320
industry

305
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,160
stakeholders and by the way this is

306
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,920
uh for the rapid response scenarios that

307
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,060
actually is the unique

308
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,839
[Music]

309
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,360
process that phil really has as an ngo

310
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,279
in their activities so

311
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,040
we need to understand what

312
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,600
the behavior of every one of these

313
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,560
personas

314
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,079
in order to offer a failure um

315
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,240
not only the interfaces would attain

316
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,560
were a way to interact

317
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,600
with information and products

318
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,959
and we know we need to get

319
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,240
feedback from the end user

320
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,639
so we need to understand how the end

321
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,160
user interacts

322
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,440
in in his uh in this daily life

323
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,240
in order to to offer something that is

324
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,000
easy to transition

325
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,519
and uh in the case of the partnered

326
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,160
or the client we understand that they

327
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,720
are

328
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,320
investing in in

329
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,320
some resources to

330
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,959
help feel ready to make all these

331
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,000
products and

332
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,519
deliver the the aid to this uh different

333
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,880
location so the partner or the client

334
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,839
will need

335
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,519
to know what's going on with their

336
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,160
resources and

337
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,200
just to to to be sure that

338
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
everything is going fine and the quality

339
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,320
is achieved

340
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,680
so we we we have been configuration in

341
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,680
of our design this this client persona

342
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,399
and uh pure release engineers we

343
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,240
understand that they need to

344
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,560
to have uh fast tools in order to help

345
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:48,959
them

346
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,000
to respond appropriately to every

347
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,959
situation they have

348
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,600
next one please yeah and

349
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,160
we also identified this other personas

350
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,639
in the

351
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,760
long term scenarios and

352
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,240
we know phil ready works in different

353
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,519
locations

354
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,720
and when they have these long-term

355
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,279
projects

356
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,480
what they do is they establish

357
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,199
maker spaces or pop labs and they're

358
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,240
trained

359
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,079
local people to to produce

360
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,760
some of their solutions and

361
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,600
some of these locations are like uh

362
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,959
really following um a type of

363
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,399
establishment

364
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,440
like a makerspace or a fab lab and

365
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,639
we understand people there are

366
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,760
different from the other type of

367
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,279
location where

368
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,120
like the ones they they used to lock

369
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,079
to contact local manufacturers we use

370
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,160
more traditional

371
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,199
types of manufacturing processes

372
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,720
and we need to understand

373
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,120
this personas differently in order to

374
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,639
offer something

375
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,760
that is intended to help them

376
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,480
in the process of documentation and also

377
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,519
testing

378
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,639
and also in their

379
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,320
processes of manufacturing in order to

380
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,399
facilitate a way to

381
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,440
help them also to achieve quality in

382
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,560
their products

383
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,600
or expect or to achieve the achieve the

384
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,320
respect the quality of their products

385
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
next one please

386
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,399
so uh we

387
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,680
made this research with online

388
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,079
information and as many as john

389
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,040
mentioned

390
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,920
we have a long meet ups with katherine

391
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,399
and

392
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,320
andrew and some of this information

393
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,360
is really really valuable but

394
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,600
we still need to know the perception of

395
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,839
more people inside their organization

396
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,320
and

397
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,920
they also too from people who is uh

398
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,759
taking place in some of their process

399
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,120
like uh the

400
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,480
local manufacturers the the the person

401
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,759
that um

402
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,199
delivered the products and also

403
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,720
the the end users

404
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,920
so uh for that we we made this uh survey

405
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,399
to

406
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,759
to get our information from from their

407
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,720
location

408
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,279
and we are still uh in the process of

409
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,720
getting the information and um

410
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,240
distributing this this survey so for now

411
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,920
we will still have uh

412
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,600
our hypothesis and and all the research

413
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,800
of work

414
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,680
next one please

415
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,360
and we know this is about quality

416
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,880
assurance so

417
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,000
we were researching how quality

418
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,599
assurance is certified and we know that

419
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,160
there is uh some important organization

420
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,280
around the world that work um making

421
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,599
these

422
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,799
standards and but the one we are using

423
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,799
is the iso standard

424
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,720
and then 9001 which is a

425
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,599
worldwide use for quality assurance and

426
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,039
um

427
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,360
we are also taking in consideration some

428
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,240
other

429
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,039
iso standards that that like this one

430
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,440
for

431
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,039
labeling and just to end with this

432
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,720
uh we understand that this is uh

433
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,080
the main thing to resolve quality

434
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,799
assurance

435
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,160
but we need to prepare first all the

436
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,480
uh organization to receive all these uh

437
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,400
um standards like we need to offer first

438
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,080
uh

439
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,640
a more uh standardized way for

440
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,120
communication and to manage information

441
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,960
so this research is about

442
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,640
to know how they interact

443
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,600
right now to offer a new way to interact

444
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,720
that can be uh more suitable

445
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,200
to receive this uh new um

446
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,840
like recommendations by the iso

447
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,320
standards

448
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,080
and i will pass the

449
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,160
the um this is a slide to

450
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,440
to misha thank you very much

451
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,799
hello everyone um i'm really excited to

452
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,440
be here

453
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,679
uh i'm visha from india and i'm having a

454
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,600
great time working with my teammates

455
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,039
carmen antonio

456
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,120
this is our final stage of presentation

457
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,799
where we're gonna basically

458
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,919
uh present our exploration of ideas

459
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,160
for abstract concepts which might serve

460
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,200
as solution to the

461
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,840
challenge in front of us

462
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,880
so as you know tom mentioned before uh

463
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,080
there are these three

464
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,039
tasks and three abstract concepts we're

465
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,000
presenting

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,520
first is building a culture of

467
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,200
documentation second

468
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,280
is receiving user feedback in new and

469
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,880
innovative ways

470
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,039
and third is experimenting with robust

471
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,080
labeling

472
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,559
systems

473
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,400
so first we want to talk about building

474
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,080
a culture of documentation

475
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,919
testing and quality assurance within

476
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,559
field ready our idea is why don't we

477
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,320
rethink the design of testing to

478
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
increase usability

479
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,919
when i say that what i'm trying to say

480
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,480
is that you have all these testing plans

481
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,120
which

482
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
which are all text so why don't we

483
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,840
include more visual and interactive data

484
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
to say that i mean to say we could have

485
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,559
checklists validation processes maybe

486
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,000
some testing modules in

487
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,799
video formats and stuff like that which

488
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,679
would make it

489
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,120
much more easier for the local

490
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,000
manufacturers and employees to abide by

491
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,480
and also to detect any defects in the

492
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
product so for instance if we're

493
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,120
recording a video

494
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,640
of a product being made and just

495
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,880
uploading it for the local manufacturer

496
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
they would know where the defect is

497
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,400
coming or if something is not going

498
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
right and they could identify it right

499
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,880
that point

500
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,799
so that's what we mean by rethinking the

501
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,640
design of testing and making it more

502
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,039
visual

503
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,919
now if testing is simple reliable and

504
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:32,799
fast

505
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,960
why don't we have it both at the

506
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,240
manufacturing point

507
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,480
and at the delivering point that is why

508
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,240
don't we build this trust in the end

509
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,360
users community

510
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,039
when we are deploying this concept of

511
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,400
decentralized manufacturing which field

512
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,840
that he believes in

513
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,799
so um when a user walks in a store or

514
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,679
even when they

515
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,840
order a product online they would always

516
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,919
search for defects such as scratches

517
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,159
cracks or missing parts or if it's not

518
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,280
working right

519
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,480
so we do know there is testing at

520
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,799
the manufacturing point but what if when

521
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,240
we were delivering products

522
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,919
the users could actually check the

523
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,679
defects right that moment

524
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,280
rather than waiting to contact field

525
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,600
ready later which might become a problem

526
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,240
for them

527
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
so what if field ready could become an

528
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,159
authoritative source of simple tests to

529
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,360
do on their products

530
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,200
to ensure that users could formalize

531
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,640
this existing process

532
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,039
that is building this trust in the users

533
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,720
community that when the product reaches

534
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,200
to them

535
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,240
they have access to really detect these

536
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,039
defects

537
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,960
or even ask the field-ready employee or

538
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,080
manufacturer

539
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,760
what things they should keep in mind

540
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,960
when using these products

541
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,120
the second thing is receiving user

542
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,520
feedback in a new and innovative way

543
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,760
so what we're thinking about is maybe

544
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
using whatsapp or messages

545
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,320
to uh from the end user to feel ready

546
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
whenever they have a defect or they need

547
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,400
more supply of the product here is an

548
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,120
example

549
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,960
for instance there is a defect in the

550
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
rescue airbag

551
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,840
field very employee would ask you what

552
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,440
the serial number is or what your

553
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,080
location

554
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,000
basically some important specifications

555
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
they would need to reach out to you and

556
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,640
actually

557
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,799
correct the product or fix the product

558
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,720
now there can be two cases if there are

559
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,480
low volume of messages we would

560
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,799
resort to human replies that is a feel

561
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,559
ready employee getting back to them

562
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,320
but if there's medium to high volume of

563
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,840
messages from end users

564
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,360
we might as well fuse that with

565
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,760
automated bots so it could be an online

566
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,640
chat service

567
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,960
on a web app sort of thing where the end

568
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,640
user is communicating their problem to

569
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,520
feel ready

570
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,200
and field readiness community

571
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,039
communicating back to the end user

572
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,840
regarding their problem

573
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,640
the third thing is experimenting with

574
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,559
robust labeling systems

575
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,799
now we're still experimenting and

576
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,679
exploring this

577
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
uh we basically divide the field ready

578
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,559
products into two categories short-term

579
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,720
rapid response products and long-term

580
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,960
products so for short-term products what

581
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,080
we were thinking was

582
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,880
uh what if we have robust barcodes stuff

583
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,360
you see

584
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
on the airport baggage tags which are

585
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,840
made of highly thermal sensitive

586
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,080
and are also pretty non-erasable and

587
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,120
they have some

588
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,880
really really important information on

589
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
them such as the location from where

590
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,600
it's going

591
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,840
the part numbers or the baggage numbers

592
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,120
which are some things which we might

593
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,960
have for field ready so that

594
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
the user knows where the product is

595
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,200
coming from what the part number is and

596
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,280
how can they contact feel very

597
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,080
the other idea is to have a label marker

598
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,360
and thanks to tom for

599
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,320
printing that field ready one um that's

600
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,200
basically their

601
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,640
rescue airbag tag and then we basically

602
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,440
tried

603
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,840
label marking it and in that you

604
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,559
basically

605
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,080
uh print out letter one by one

606
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,559
and it's pretty efficient in robust too

607
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,799
for the long term we have two more ideas

608
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,360
one is 3d printed engraver embossed text

609
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,000
so when

610
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,320
field ready is designing products in the

611
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,640
product itself they can

612
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,720
make the field ready logo and put down

613
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,080
some really

614
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,000
specific details of the product which

615
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,840
might be helpful to the manufacturers

616
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,120
and the end users

617
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,200
and then print it out so then they would

618
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,960
have the details the field ready logo

619
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,760
and the product

620
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,559
all in one and the other idea is to make

621
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,559
metal information plates with the help

622
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,120
of

623
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,440
recycled aluminium cans so we're going

624
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,240
to use that

625
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,799
and then print in information specific

626
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,520
to the product

627
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,360
now this is where we're combining or

628
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
exploring to combine everything in one

629
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,720
place so we're combining our

630
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,000
documentation

631
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,799
user feedback and tracking system all in

632
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:39,520
one in an

633
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,960
application a user friendly application

634
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,760
sort of

635
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
so different interfaces would be present

636
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,279
for different stakeholders

637
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,440
so when you come on the app there should

638
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,720
probably be a user

639
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,200
a manufacturer and an fr employee tab

640
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,840
sort of

641
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,600
and whichever icon you click on you're

642
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,279
going to be navigating to a different

643
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,400
interface

644
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,080
and the reason why we were thinking

645
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,840
about this is because firstly it would

646
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,120
be very user friendly

647
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,279
it could be a desktop or a web app or

648
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,039
even a mobile application

649
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,200
and by simply clicking on it a user can

650
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,799
go and

651
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,640
discover all the product details the

652
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,000
part number how to

653
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
contact field ready how to get

654
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,279
specification

655
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,080
uh specifications about any defects or

656
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,960
anything they would

657
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,480
want to ask to feel ready so like a

658
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,159
contact service a messaging service

659
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,320
would be included in that

660
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,240
when it comes to the manufacturer they

661
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,000
would have access to all these video

662
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,039
testing modules

663
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,520
risk assessment plans and for the fr

664
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,440
employee there will be this validation

665
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,679
checklist and inspection checklist which

666
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,000
would help in basically integrating

667
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,320
the labeling and tracking system with

668
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,320
quality control and quality assurance

669
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,600
this is our team and thank you everyone

670
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,279
that was our presentation

671
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,840
and now i would like to pass it on to

672
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
magenta

673
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,080
thank you so much to the awesome field

674
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,120
ready dream team

675
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,360
for your presentation thank you tom

676
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,960
misha and antonio

677
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,720
and for the beautiful design as well i

678
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,279
have to give some props to that

679
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,919
really nice so i just want to remind our

680
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,320
audience members that you can drop any

681
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,760
questions that you might have for the

682
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,679
field ready dream team or the field

683
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,279
ready panelists

684
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,279
in the comments on our live and we'll be

685
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,400
sure to integrate those

686
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,120
into our 10-minute q a at the end of the

687
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,720
session today

688
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,880
so we're about 20 minutes in we've just

689
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,200
seen the field ready dream team

690
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,279
presentations for their early concepts

691
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,120
and now we'll move on to about 20

692
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,960
minutes of discussion

693
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,559
between our panelists and the dream team

694
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,039
members thanks again for everyone who's

695
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,559
just joining we're really excited to

696
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,520
have you here

697
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,840
and thanks to everyone on our panel i'm

698
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,440
excited to hear uh

699
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,960
launch in the video discussion

700
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,559
i'll pass it off to cat and andrew to

701
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,320
get started with any questions or the

702
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,159
dream team if they want to

703
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,200
initiate any questions here

704
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,279
andrew i'll let you take it away um

705
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,279
well thank you um and antonio and

706
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,480
misha and uh thomas for your

707
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,880
uh presentation then for your thinking

708
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,480
and work on this

709
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,159
um i i like uh i'm actually

710
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,799
finding almost the simplicity of your um

711
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,080
initial proposal here very compelling

712
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,480
so thank you for um it you know it makes

713
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,799
sense makes a lot of sense to me

714
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,240
um my um

715
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,760
my first question is sort of uh

716
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,440
the around the division of the

717
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,840
short-term and the long-term

718
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,039
labeling is that a practical

719
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,080
just a practical consideration um or

720
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,919
does it is there something on the label

721
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:58,559
itself

722
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,960
like some serial numbers will be used

723
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,080
more quickly than other

724
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,159
serial numbers or is it a practical

725
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,840
consideration because some of the parts

726
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,360
that we make

727
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,080
um will last a lot longer so it will

728
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,279
need they will need to be made in a

729
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,159
different material

730
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,039
as simple

731
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,200
um so i think it's it's more of a

732
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,039
practical consideration based on the

733
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,799
fact that if for example

734
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,200
you have a a latrine which might be

735
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
outdoors for 10 plus years

736
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,720
it doesn't make sense to use the same

737
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
labeling technology for

738
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,720
that as it would a single-use disposable

739
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,880
set of tweezers or an umbilical cord

740
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,919
clamp

741
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,360
um and yeah so i think we're

742
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,640
we're very much still in this

743
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,559
experimental phase regarding the

744
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,840
labeling and i think we

745
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,960
we need to do more um testing ourselves

746
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,440
to

747
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,000
see how well and how robust different

748
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,760
labeling solutions work

749
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,159
and based on that we'll we'll either

750
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:00,880
pick

751
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,120
one or maybe two different solutions

752
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,720
that we can balance out

753
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,120
because often the longer term products

754
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,919
um

755
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,200
like like the latrines um would be

756
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,640
um manufactured in slightly lower

757
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,840
volumes than the

758
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,120
high um than the short-term single-use

759
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,000
product

760
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,399
and so it seems appropriate to spend a

761
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,240
little bit more time creating a label so

762
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,799
you know

763
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,799
obviously if you're going to be like

764
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,640
cutting up an aluminium can for every

765
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,399
single set of tweezers we felt that that

766
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,279
would be

767
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,720
um unreasonable um

768
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,760
from a time perspective um but uh

769
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,159
yeah so so it's really it's really about

770
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,000
the practicality

771
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,159
and the long liberty i think does that

772
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,320
answer your question absolutely

773
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,880
yeah i just wanted to make sure um of

774
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,720
that no

775
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,279
makes sense keep it simple in that

776
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,480
context

777
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,760
um i quite like the uh

778
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,000
proposal you made around one of the

779
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,120
labels which was

780
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,479
on the um

781
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,159
recycling now they're making from the

782
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,960
drinks can that caught my attention

783
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,120
um to what extent have you been able to

784
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,039
find out about

785
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,000
um you know the kind of contacts that we

786
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,039
work in and the

787
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,720
facilities available in sort of the

788
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,399
refugee camps where we

789
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,080
may be making things and how you know

790
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,440
what sort of solutions did that

791
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,279
close down for you i guess

792
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,520
um it's a it's a good question

793
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,279
um i think

794
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,399
we so we what we did the our process

795
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,240
for sort of working through at least the

796
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,919
labeling solutions was we

797
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,760
we constructed actually a lot a long

798
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,039
list of um 12

799
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,320
12 plus um different sorts of labels

800
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,600
um you know ranging from rfid tags to

801
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,440
um you know all sorts um

802
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,720
and for each of those we we actually

803
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,200
took

804
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,360
we had about i think 10 10 different

805
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,039
criteria including

806
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,440
the capital expenditure so like the rfid

807
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,159
reader

808
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,000
but also the you know per item

809
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,279
expenditure

810
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,360
um as well as the availability of spare

811
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,760
parts the simplicity of the device

812
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,559
the um

813
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,919
usability and speed as well as the

814
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,200
readability both

815
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,799
computer readability or machine

816
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,279
readability as well as human readability

817
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,200
um so all of these um ended up in a

818
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,000
pretty glorified excel table um

819
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,559
basically with with rankings out of five

820
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,679
for each of them um you know what i may

821
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:43,919
as

822
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,600
i may as well i may as well just show

823
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,200
you i mean we put the work in so

824
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,600
i think yeah i'd be interested because

825
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,559
actually

826
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,799
in a lot of innovation processes it's

827
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,919
it's uh

828
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,360
important um to sort of explain the

829
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,760
choices you didn't make and why

830
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,919
as much as it is the choices that you

831
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,600
did make and

832
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,559
yeah and uh yeah trying to talk us

833
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,200
through this

834
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,880
thank you sure so um

835
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,640
so you can see here we've got all of the

836
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,200
solutions down the left-hand side

837
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,480
um all of the solutions that we

838
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,960
considered at least um including you

839
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,880
know handheld inkjet printers

840
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,279
um all the way down to like the bare

841
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,679
bones just a sticky label and a biro

842
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,840
and um along the top we've got all of

843
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,279
the considerations that we

844
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,159
that we took um including so yeah as i

845
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,120
mentioned costs

846
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,880
robustness like long liberty of the

847
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,960
solution machine readability

848
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,919
um human readability um availability of

849
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,120
spare parts now

850
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,399
this is this actually touches like this

851
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,039
column is the one that touches most upon

852
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:49,440
like

853
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,679
your point about availability or like

854
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,279
you know the situations in which you

855
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,720
operate um in environments which you

856
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,440
operate in

857
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,600
um sadly we haven't had the ability to

858
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,200
actually chat to anyone in the field yet

859
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,799
but i we're scheduling some meetings for

860
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:01,679
that shortly

861
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,159
um so we'll be able to really hone in on

862
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,320
this and see whether our

863
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,159
assumptions and research really ring

864
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,640
through in in the field um and then

865
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,919
complexity

866
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,640
material diversity um like how many

867
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,080
materials does it work with

868
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,440
um label um and then yeah

869
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,840
customizability like for example uh

870
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,240
an rfid tag can often be rewritten

871
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,600
whereas that would be very hard to do

872
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,720
with a label

873
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,840
save just printing another one that's

874
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,399
sticking on top and then time taken

875
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,880
so you can see that we we we've we've

876
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,799
set guidelines for what a five would be

877
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,039
and what one five is good one is bad

878
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,480
as it you know good bad um and so we

879
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,720
we were able to evaluate the solutions

880
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,000
based on this

881
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,760
and this is what led us to um

882
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,279
led us to the solutions which we

883
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,360
presented um

884
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,600
but we we didn't we didn't just like

885
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,399
kind of

886
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,559
solely look at the numbers we also we

887
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,240
used this really as a process

888
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,919
to remind ourselves and ask ourselves

889
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,600
questions about the solutions and force

890
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
ourselves to think about the things that

891
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,440
we might have

892
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,200
gotten uh thank you

893
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,239
yeah oh sorry um i really love this

894
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,399
chart thomas first time i'm seeing it

895
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,918
uh i i might have missed it but

896
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,918
i think maybe if you continue working

897
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,239
off this chart as your process goes on

898
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,520
an important metric um you asked how

899
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,839
complex are the machines involved for

900
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,320
making the tags but i don't see a metric

901
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,960
for how

902
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,839
portable are the machines involved you

903
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,520
know like um i think that's

904
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,320
fine yeah um worth considering is like

905
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,079
can it be thrown into a duffel bag and

906
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:38,879
go with

907
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,800
somebody somewhere adding the criteria

908
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,040
now

909
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,040
i'm not going to fill it up but

910
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,760
we'll be watching innovation in action

911
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,879
there um

912
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,320
misha you know i and um

913
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,359
antonio as well i mean you're

914
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,119
sort of um uh

915
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,680
you know understanding of uh low

916
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,520
resource settings and the

917
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,359
you know in the context that you're

918
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,400
living and working in that you've grown

919
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,440
up in

920
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,680
um i know that you know

921
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,040
it's perhaps it's not as extreme a case

922
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,320
as a disaster zone or as a

923
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,560
refugee camp type situation but you may

924
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,160
have experienced those sorts of

925
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,560
settings uh in your countries at some

926
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,920
point with um

927
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,760
you know floods and earthquakes and so

928
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,160
on could you tell me a little bit about

929
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,359
how some of your own experiences might

930
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:43,599
have

931
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,560
informed uh your judgment do you think

932
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,040
were there

933
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,920
other particular sort of issues that you

934
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,839
had in mind as you were making some of

935
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,160
those

936
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,760
the evaluations on the different

937
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,079
potential solutions maybe misha first

938
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,119
and then antonio

939
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,240
i feel like uh one one of the things uh

940
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,720
all of us agreed on was that it's more

941
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,839
important for this

942
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,880
uh for this product to be considered

943
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,720
from a very human need

944
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,839
even if it's not extremely innovative or

945
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,359
like extremely tech

946
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,280
it should definitely focus on the human

947
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,280
need and the reason why we

948
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,440
focus on that is because as you said

949
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,280
these are disaster zones like

950
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,359
especially uh recently we had like

951
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,320
continuous earthquakes in delhi in india

952
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,359
and there's there's very less you can do

953
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,200
because there are many organizations

954
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,960
which would try reaching out to some

955
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,839
users but

956
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,599
you can't reach out to a broad set of

957
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,160
users so one thing we had in mind was

958
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,359
that what is something

959
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,440
we can propose which could reach out to

960
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,880
a broad set of users

961
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,640
because there are people in haiti there

962
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,920
are people in vietnam

963
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,640
iraq syria jordan there's like it's all

964
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,079
over the world

965
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,000
people are suffering and people in

966
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,920
refugee camps have access to really

967
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,040
really less things

968
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
the reason i know that is that uh

969
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
recently i joined this club and

970
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,200
we were basically figuring out how to

971
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,040
like you know do remote teaching for

972
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,359
them

973
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,240
sort of and it's all about just like

974
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,000
taking that initiative to think from a

975
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,079
very user-minded perspective

976
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,280
which is how we arrive to our uh uh the

977
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,200
messaging service sort of

978
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,599
like no one would think that it's it's

979
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,599
like innovative or like

980
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,079
but it's the simplicity i feel like the

981
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,920
end user can directly just reach out to

982
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,599
feel ready either through messaging or

983
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,200
through an automated bot

984
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,839
and they can get their uh issue fixed

985
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:32,880
simply like here

986
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,119
we have a lot of web services where like

987
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,960
there might be automated bots

988
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,359
and you could like get your reply as

989
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,040
soon as possible

990
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,920
so that was one of the things i feel and

991
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,400
when

992
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
when there are floods i feel like there

993
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,320
are some people who would like

994
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,720
need to reconstruct houses from like a

995
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,560
to z from the base

996
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,320
i think it's the most difficult then

997
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,680
because that's when your material

998
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,280
availability the point you brought up

999
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,079
comes up

1000
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,000
and i feel like that is something we

1001
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,760
really considered while doing our

1002
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,640
research about

1003
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
feed ready but i feel like to get an

1004
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,680
in-depth uh

1005
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,359
view on it we would definitely want to

1006
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,960
interview someone and you know get to

1007
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,359
know

1008
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,760
more about it because right now uh our

1009
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,520
spreadsheet is more like based on our

1010
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,440
research and some conversations but i

1011
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,000
think

1012
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,599
once we get a more in-depth view we

1013
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,760
would get to know more about it but

1014
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,520
i feel like yeah we'll make that happen

1015
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,680
thank you yeah

1016
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,280
i think yeah we'll make that happen with

1017
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,880
our field teams i mean i think that

1018
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,480
this is something that we that's really

1019
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,240
important to us antonio the same

1020
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,280
question was there

1021
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,200
anything that was sort of from your

1022
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,720
experience in

1023
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,560
mexico that was influencing your

1024
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,400
decision it's just one of the appealing

1025
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,240
things about what hackaday has done here

1026
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,720
with this

1027
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
with this challenge is that they brought

1028
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,240
together a global team

1029
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,839
so you know you each bring different

1030
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,400
perspectives and i'm interested in yours

1031
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,760
yes uh i have lived

1032
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,119
some of these situations myself and

1033
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,000
i know what is to to be in difficult

1034
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,480
environments with very low resources and

1035
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,599
of course i understand what's the

1036
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,320
value of the tools

1037
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,150
that are available to help us to

1038
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,320
[Music]

1039
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,320
get get up and just

1040
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,680
resolve some of the basic needs

1041
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,359
we we have in these situations and

1042
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,200
that's why uh and we all three agree on

1043
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,000
this

1044
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,720
we need to focus in the value of the

1045
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,800
things we are going to deploy

1046
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,680
like more than the

1047
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,680
how technological they are or

1048
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,880
something else we need to focus in

1049
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,040
if the persons there are going to be

1050
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
are going to find value in whatever we

1051
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,240
are going to deploy there

1052
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,160
and if that's the case

1053
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,920
how we are going to make these solutions

1054
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,960
usable suitable for them and

1055
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,839
because

1056
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,200
we need to understand also that we need

1057
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,520
to

1058
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,760
adapt our solutions to different

1059
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,079
circumstances not only by the disaster

1060
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,760
but by the culture

1061
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,040
and every every location

1062
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,720
has their own cultures and their ways to

1063
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,839
communicate

1064
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,480
their needs and some of them will be

1065
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,280
very shy

1066
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,760
like probably they will not answer a

1067
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,480
survey

1068
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,560
or they will not like to be a

1069
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,520
photographer

1070
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,720
or something in in some circumstances so

1071
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,319
we need to find a way to

1072
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,079
get information from from their behavior

1073
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,839
more than uh really standardized

1074
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,240
uh forms to get information like we need

1075
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,440
to be very flexible

1076
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,800
in those scenarios and

1077
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,760
uh the other and that's what led to the

1078
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,040
whatsapp

1079
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,119
based user feedback it was meeting

1080
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,560
people on their own terms

1081
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,800
yeah i i really like that thank you i to

1082
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,760
be honest with you

1083
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
i'm not quite sure why i haven't thought

1084
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,280
about just doing that before but

1085
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,480
um but thank you

1086
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,800
thank you um i have a couple of more

1087
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,640
more questions but catherine

1088
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,560
um do you want to pick up your questions

1089
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,800
um yeah sure i think um

1090
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,319
i have more feedback than then questions

1091
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,480
um so i don't know you could carry on

1092
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,760
with your questioning and we can come

1093
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,440
back to my feedback at the end

1094
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,800
no okay i'll take it away um okay

1095
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,200
uh i similarly to andrew

1096
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,240
really i'm excited by the aluminum

1097
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,200
stamping i know

1098
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,599
it's early stages and and maybe you're

1099
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,240
not going to

1100
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,560
take that one to the finish line but i

1101
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,760
am excited to see it

1102
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,599
at this stage it seems promising and i

1103
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,440
think one of the things that seems

1104
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,119
promising and would be worth considering

1105
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:03,440
is

1106
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,720
um what would it take to make a

1107
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,520
very portable aluminum stamping kit that

1108
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,960
like every field ready

1109
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,520
employee could have and maybe already uh

1110
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,440
maybe in that kit is a lot of like tiny

1111
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,000
pre-cut

1112
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,960
tags and those little chains that hook

1113
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,720
on or zip ties or

1114
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,880
whatever it is but i could see something

1115
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,160
that's like

1116
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,480
a small little thing that people can

1117
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,760
just take

1118
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,440
um and then you're not uh dealing with

1119
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,880
printers or baggage technology um

1120
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,240
again i mean i'm not trying to make you

1121
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,160
like converge onto that solution

1122
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,640
right now but just wanted to say great

1123
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,240
work i'm excited by that

1124
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,720
um and i think that could be a fun

1125
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,280
aspect

1126
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,720
of this challenge for you too is to

1127
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,040
think about okay this is a good idea

1128
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,000
what does it take

1129
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,280
um for those tags to be made

1130
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,319
outside of our fab labs in the field um

1131
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,760
and then i guess i would also just

1132
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,440
encourage you as you move forward

1133
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,760
i'm excited by this app platform too i

1134
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,319
also think it leaves a lot of room for

1135
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,119
growth and change and many different

1136
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:09,760
types of

1137
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,200
labels like maybe in five years rfid

1138
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,200
tags will seem like a better fit

1139
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,760
and if the app is a solid platform it

1140
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,440
like allows for that sort of

1141
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,040
um movement of field ready

1142
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,960
but also um

1143
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,240
yeah i would just encourage you to think

1144
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,400
about what else needs to be in place

1145
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,520
to make that app successful because um

1146
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,640
apps don't it seems like they work

1147
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,680
without any

1148
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,359
labor but like you know there might need

1149
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,160
to be somebody spending more time on the

1150
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,599
test plan documentation and

1151
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,280
visualization maybe

1152
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,880
maybe field ready to think critically

1153
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,640
about graphic design talent

1154
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,160
um on staff maybe there needs to be

1155
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,119
somebody who

1156
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,599
is a skilled programmer to do app

1157
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,560
maintenance

1158
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,000
maybe um what's what do you expect it's

1159
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,560
going to take

1160
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,319
to respond just i'd love to see in your

1161
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,920
solution like

1162
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,960
if you end up going with an app sketches

1163
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,560
for the app early stage prototypes with

1164
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,319
the app but maybe also recommendations

1165
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,599
for like

1166
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,160
what other steps maybe even from an hr

1167
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,000
standpoint just field ready need to take

1168
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,480
to like

1169
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,680
make your solution a success um

1170
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,800
so but yeah i'm really excited uh by

1171
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,760
this whole thing and

1172
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,240
it's been a pleasure working with you um

1173
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,359
as we go and also just research juice

1174
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,480
apps

1175
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,400
is there some app platform that already

1176
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,400
exists that you could leverage for this

1177
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,280
or

1178
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,359
uh does this need to be built from the

1179
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,839
ground up sort of stuff

1180
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,160
um

1181
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,599
yeah that's all my feedback for right

1182
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,880
now i'll send it back to andrew

1183
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,040
thank you that's that's super valuable

1184
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,240
um and some really

1185
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,880
yeah really really good points there um

1186
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,400
and definitely stuff that we will take

1187
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,440
on board

1188
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,920
um yeah it's about thinking about the

1189
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,520
the broader picture than just the

1190
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,520
the app is what the user might see but

1191
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,440
behind the scenes there's going to be

1192
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,640
a whole load of moving parts um yeah and

1193
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,680
that's not a bad thing

1194
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,839
i think i think that's an exciting thing

1195
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,480
um

1196
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,720
yeah yeah

1197
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,400
yeah thanks and you know it's a

1198
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,079
challenge for everyone

1199
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,359
you create an app and you know then you

1200
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,000
have to encourage

1201
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,680
people to use it for it to be useful

1202
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,200
sort of thing and i think that that's

1203
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,079
um uh there are no we can tell you about

1204
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,280
a number of

1205
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,040
uh systems that have been introduced um

1206
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,800
or you know been used for a long time in

1207
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,720
the aids sector that are specifically

1208
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,119
for sort of refugees and there's ways

1209
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:49,839
that we maybe

1210
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,359
may be able to integrate some of those

1211
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,680
but i think that the use of whatsapp in

1212
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,880
the first instance

1213
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,839
um will sort of mitigate some of that

1214
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,760
um thank you my

1215
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,240
um question is really

1216
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,480
on the first point about the culture of

1217
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,400
documentation and quality assurance i

1218
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,200
mean i think

1219
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,960
um that uh is

1220
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,400
um it's really often very hard as

1221
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,800
you know you may well know from your own

1222
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,079
personal behavior

1223
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,319
that it's quite difficult to incentivize

1224
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,839
or to be motivated

1225
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,960
to document your creations

1226
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,079
uh in a way in a level of detail or even

1227
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:32,560
like

1228
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,160
a code of documenting their software

1229
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,640
properly in a way that makes it

1230
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,480
open for other people to replicate um

1231
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,319
and it's often quite difficult to get

1232
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,480
people to motivate people to provide

1233
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,000
feedback um or to feel that they

1234
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,119
should they can it is their right to do

1235
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:51,520
so

1236
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,440
you know um there's all sorts of power

1237
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,720
relationships of course

1238
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,720
in planetary relief so my question is

1239
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,880
have you thought about ways that you

1240
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,720
could use this system to perhaps

1241
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,240
incentivize

1242
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,720
documentation and incentivize feedback

1243
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,040
from users

1244
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,960
and you don't have to answer right now

1245
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,640
but it may be something you could think

1246
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,359
about in the next stage of the project

1247
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,079
have you had any thoughts on that anya

1248
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,599
do you have any thoughts on that

1249
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,920
yes um we know this concept of

1250
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,359
gamification and

1251
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,160
we talked about this and as part of our

1252
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,760
first idea of this app which is only one

1253
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,559
of the

1254
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,680
other interfaces human interface we can

1255
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,640
have

1256
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,880
we know we need to reinforce the

1257
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,240
the activity of documenting and as you

1258
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,599
mentioned to

1259
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,520
get feedback for something that you are

1260
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,720
creating or

1261
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,920
yeah so gamification is one of our

1262
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,880
ideas to implement in this uh we still

1263
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,920
don't know

1264
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,160
how we incentivize the

1265
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,040
creators to document because it will

1266
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,880
depend a lot on their

1267
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,800
um on their uh

1268
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,079
user in in our user research

1269
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,160
and we we still need to complete that

1270
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,160
part to know that

1271
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,200
but yeah we know

1272
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,640
thank you i'm glad you're thinking about

1273
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,400
it yeah that's great

1274
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,440
and then if i have time um magenta

1275
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,800
for um another question i really like

1276
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,079
the fact that you've taken

1277
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,960
the time to look at the iso standards

1278
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,720
for quality management systems and for

1279
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,079
labeling

1280
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,599
uh you know there's international

1281
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,119
standards um

1282
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,839
so my question is potentially um

1283
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,839
uh the sort of uh iconoclast in me that

1284
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:56,400
sort of

1285
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,559
wants to kind of challenge the status

1286
00:48:58,559 --> 00:48:59,920
quo all the time

1287
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,800
um how useful were these standards were

1288
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,440
they

1289
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,720
you know are they sort of

1290
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,559
um in some ways standards

1291
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,240
can become uh the

1292
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,440
um a barrier to entry

1293
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,720
for local makers and local manufacturers

1294
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,800
to a market you know because it's not

1295
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,040
properly labeled because that's not made

1296
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,920
in a place that has an iso 9001

1297
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,520
qms system certified we aren't going to

1298
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,119
buy from you you know those can be

1299
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,480
barriers

1300
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,599
do you think that um

1301
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,280
i'm interested in whether you think that

1302
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,440
these up these standards might

1303
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,079
be locking us into outdated outdated

1304
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,440
ways of working

1305
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,760
or whether really they are still

1306
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,280
valuable from what you've understood of

1307
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:49,920
them

1308
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,760
um to the sort of innovative

1309
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,599
technologies that we're using today

1310
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,400
in manufacturing

1311
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,800
well um as you mentioned

1312
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,359
standards can become a barrier and we

1313
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:04,640
understand that

1314
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,640
and we understand that in certain

1315
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,760
locations will be

1316
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:14,000
like um impossible or or not not

1317
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,160
will be expensive to to reach these

1318
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,280
standards

1319
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,640
and in other scenarios will be just

1320
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,079
not useful at all and but

1321
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,760
this is our fierce approach to what

1322
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,200
it is right now um how we solve quality

1323
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,640
assurance right now

1324
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,680
and that's why we we take

1325
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,280
uh a research to understand a little bit

1326
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,160
of

1327
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,480
iso because we need to know what is

1328
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,240
made nowadays in order to innovate

1329
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,520
and um also

1330
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,559
we understand that probably

1331
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,359
it will not be useful to use the fault

1332
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,280
standard for labeling

1333
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,890
but we want to

1334
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,480
[Music]

1335
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,880
have an on an understanding of what

1336
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,839
information is

1337
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,359
useful in a label and not only for us

1338
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,920
because these labels will be used

1339
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,640
properly

1340
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,599
and will be seen and used for other

1341
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,680
people outside the organization

1342
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,559
so we want to be sure that someone

1343
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,880
outside the context will understand that

1344
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,920
information

1345
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,040
i will find that useful

1346
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,839
uh if thank you if you if you don't mind

1347
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,800
andrew i'd like to add on to that

1348
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,960
from our first conversation you

1349
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,000
suggested us to do

1350
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,400
like a research on how different

1351
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,839
industries are also

1352
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,480
dealing with this and we all looked into

1353
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,599
medical

1354
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,480
uh healthcare food and humanitarian aid

1355
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,079
industries and we saw how

1356
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,920
there's iso standards but also these

1357
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,520
different standards but

1358
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,760
something we really noticed was that all

1359
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,520
of these industries have come up with

1360
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,240
symbols

1361
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,960
which they use for defining various

1362
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,920
things like

1363
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,680
how much is their usage or what

1364
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,520
standards are being applied to them

1365
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,760
or what's their life expectancy sort of

1366
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,280
or stuff like that

1367
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,359
so i think uh we are sort of still

1368
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,599
exploring these iso standards and we

1369
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,200
still need to see

1370
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,119
which ones of these would actually abide

1371
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,880
by our solution

1372
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,440
which we which we really decide on but

1373
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,960
something we're definitely considering

1374
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,599
is that

1375
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,480
to definitely make it easy for the user

1376
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,040
manufacturer and all the stakeholders

1377
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,480
uh involved in the field ready

1378
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,160
organization to really

1379
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,040
once the product is ready recognize what

1380
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,800
are the risks and defects associated

1381
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,359
with it

1382
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,280
or what symbols can be used to really

1383
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,720
let the user know that yeah

1384
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,280
this implies that or stuff like that

1385
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:41,920
sort of

1386
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,920
and make it even more standardized and

1387
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,839
easy to use

1388
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,480
thank you yeah i um i think that

1389
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,839
the separation between uh labeling

1390
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:00,640
as an avenue to gather user feedback

1391
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,240
and labeling as an indicator of quality

1392
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,599
um i think is quite important and it's

1393
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,520
useful to consider having both on a

1394
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,640
product it is

1395
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,079
often achieved in everyday products by

1396
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,839
having the manufacturer name

1397
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:16,960
and some information about the

1398
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,480
manufacturer and how you can contact

1399
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:18,960
them

1400
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,800
and then there is somewhere else a label

1401
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,720
or a stamp that you can put on it and i

1402
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,359
think

1403
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:24,800
keeping those two separates quite

1404
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,760
important i think

1405
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,280
some of the challenges we're going to

1406
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,800
face as we roll out these innovations

1407
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,119
and it you know is the management of

1408
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,119
what those numbers and marks might be

1409
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,240
because of course right now anyone

1410
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,480
can put a you know a kite mark a ce mark

1411
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,920
on a product like tech physically

1412
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,680
it can be done you can just scratch it

1413
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,359
on with a pen or whatever

1414
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,359
like it's kind of um

1415
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,359
whether that means something is really

1416
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,280
the the trick and that that's the means

1417
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,640
of verification that you're putting

1418
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,880
together and i think that um

1419
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,559
you know that make the real challenge

1420
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,800
you have ahead of you now is how you can

1421
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,200
make sure that for every item

1422
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,040
whether it's something that will only

1423
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,880
ever be made once

1424
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,040
by one maker somewhere in the world or

1425
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,160
whether it's

1426
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,200
um something that is

1427
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,480
uh you know uh like a bucket is more

1428
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,839
sort of mass-produced

1429
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,680
how every single one will potentially

1430
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,839
have a different serial number

1431
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:36,559
um or you know some system like that

1432
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,079
uh that scales that that big

1433
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,359
i think that's going to be a really

1434
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:42,400
interesting challenge for what you're

1435
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,480
coming on to next

1436
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,880
i completely agree and actually just

1437
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,319
just touching on

1438
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,839
the point you made there about you know

1439
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,599
anyone can scratch in a

1440
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,720
kite mark um i think that

1441
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,640
line of thinking was really what led us

1442
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,319
to this um

1443
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,160
slightly left of field concept of

1444
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,520
actually

1445
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,280
inviting the user to do some of the

1446
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,040
quality testing because we feel that

1447
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,559
that's something that's already done

1448
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,079
like you know you buy

1449
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,799
if you buy a new a new television or

1450
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:11,359
something

1451
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,880
there'll be a list of parts that you'd

1452
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,960
expect to receive in the box and that is

1453
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,119
in a way a form of you performing

1454
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,640
quality control on the product that

1455
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,000
you've received

1456
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,839
and so we were just wondering if you we

1457
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,760
could stretch that a little bit further

1458
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,000
and develop sort of some really simple

1459
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,960
tests

1460
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,559
um that users could um perform

1461
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,559
just to in just to ensure that the

1462
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,240
product they've received is is a high

1463
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,119
quality product

1464
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,799
because that way you're really you're

1465
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:39,040
taking the power out of the hands of

1466
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,760
of the brands as it were and you're

1467
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,319
you're

1468
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:43,680
putting it in the hands of the person

1469
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,680
who cares most about the product working

1470
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,240
which is

1471
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,280
the user so that was what led us down i

1472
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,640
don't know whether we'll pursue

1473
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,240
that line of thinking but i think that

1474
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,839
it's interest as an interesting mindset

1475
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:54,960
to have you know

1476
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,559
if you're if you're a hospital and you

1477
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,160
take delivery of like

1478
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,079
100 um little widgets or whatever

1479
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,680
what if you just subject one or two of

1480
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,000
them to some easy simple

1481
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,799
guided testing um and that way it

1482
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,119
doesn't matter who the manufacturer was

1483
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,119
because regardless of their quality

1484
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,319
control systems

1485
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,559
you have this safe that allows you to

1486
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:17,520
determine

1487
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,040
you know whether it actually meets the

1488
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,280
standard not whether the kite mark was

1489
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,359
just stamped on it willy-nilly

1490
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:24,799
um so that was that was i guess the

1491
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,799
thinking behind that and yeah i wanted

1492
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,119
to connect those thoughts but yeah

1493
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,799
i like that a lot and it shifts some of

1494
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,240
the power from the procurement

1495
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,040
department

1496
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,240
to the uh actual users of the products

1497
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,119
which is often

1498
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,920
a big problem in the age sector but you

1499
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,040
know the people who have to use the

1500
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,920
final products

1501
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,119
aren't necessarily the ones who buy them

1502
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:47,440
i'm sorry to have to cut off the

1503
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,200
conversation here

1504
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,359
but we're going to transition to a

1505
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,559
little bit of q a

1506
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,520
with the last five minutes thank you so

1507
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,880
much to andrew and kat

1508
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,960
for the insight and feedback and to the

1509
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,160
whole team for

1510
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,119
um for your contributions and discussion

1511
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:03,760
here

1512
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,880
uh we mostly had some wonderful comments

1513
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,240
from the audience but there

1514
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,880
were a couple questions in here and part

1515
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,160
of

1516
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,520
some of these questions was how to get

1517
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,520
in touch and involved with this project

1518
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,839
so i'm going to start out by

1519
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,240
i can answer that by saying follow the

1520
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,040
team's project on hackaday.io

1521
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,319
by searching for hdp dream team field

1522
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:26,799
ready

1523
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,680
you can easily find misha tom and

1524
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,440
antonia's project and their work and

1525
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,640
actually

1526
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,799
message them through there or comment on

1527
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:35,760
their

1528
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,440
project page there i'm sure that they

1529
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,440
would love to hear from you all

1530
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,760
and have any sort of additional feedback

1531
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,040
or contributions from

1532
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,720
the broader audience out there it was

1533
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,640
great to see people so excited by this

1534
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,640
project

1535
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,760
from the audience so with that i'm going

1536
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,440
to move on

1537
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,200
one of the questions was could you

1538
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,280
possibly sort of reverse engineer the

1539
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,520
iso standards to see the thinking behind

1540
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,000
them

1541
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,640
and then take action on them so we'll

1542
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,759
get started with that one

1543
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,680
who wants to field this one misha

1544
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,078
tonya

1545
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,559
okay well i i can chip in

1546
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,319
a little bit i mean i don't i don't mind

1547
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,160
i don't mind answering um

1548
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,960
cool yeah i mean i think it's an

1549
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,079
interesting question

1550
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,200
it's it's it yeah i guess the heart of

1551
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,720
it is like

1552
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,880
what was the thinking behind this the

1553
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,640
creation of the standards

1554
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,520
that led to that set of rules and maybe

1555
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,960
there are another set of rules that

1556
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,280
could

1557
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,160
still help maintain quality to the same

1558
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:42,960
degree

1559
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,280
without being the same standard um i

1560
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,200
guess that's what um

1561
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,640
the question is asking and um

1562
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,839
i assume the answer i i guess yes i mean

1563
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:54,400
i don't think

1564
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,920
iso are a flawless institution you know

1565
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,960
no institution

1566
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,079
is is without fault and

1567
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,960
yeah i think um it's worth it it's

1568
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,240
definitely worth yeah as

1569
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,960
as andrew pointed out critiquing the

1570
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,079
standards

1571
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,359
and exploring both what they suggest but

1572
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,200
also what they don't suggest

1573
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,680
um and sort of yeah i don't know if that

1574
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,040
quite covers it giovanni you

1575
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,160
seemed like you had something to add as

1576
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,319
well go for it yeah i just wanted to add

1577
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,680
a couple of things

1578
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,520
um it's all about process repeatability

1579
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,000
right how how we're able to repeat a

1580
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,319
process in a consistent way

1581
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,960
both for manufacturing but for quality

1582
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,400
assurance too

1583
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,920
so when when people are relying on a

1584
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,119
standard such as iso

1585
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,319
for for quality inspection is

1586
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:45,520
essentially they're following a

1587
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,000
procedure and

1588
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,880
while what you mentioned andrew is

1589
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,359
really

1590
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,839
really valid the fact that those

1591
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,400
standards sometimes can keep people away

1592
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,559
they they can certainly be used as an

1593
00:59:58,559 --> 00:59:59,440
inspiration

1594
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,720
for a simpler system

1595
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,280
and a system that's adapted to to the

1596
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,240
local

1597
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,119
um you know people who are using them

1598
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:09,760
local

1599
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,520
stakeholders like the the whatsapp

1600
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,559
idea or the app opens so many

1601
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,799
possibilities because you can have

1602
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:21,440
a bot guide you through the process you

1603
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,760
don't even have to

1604
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,599
download all the information at once but

1605
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:26,799
you can have

1606
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:29,839
step by step or section by section go

1607
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:32,319
through the product and and with a set

1608
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:33,599
of instructions

1609
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,359
you know be sure that what you're using

1610
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,319
is is safe

1611
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,520
and i'd like to add that the the process

1612
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,839
repeat repeatability for us

1613
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:48,640
might be we make we make the item once

1614
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,920
in fiji

1615
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,920
uh 200 times in bangladesh 5 000 times

1616
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,599
um in u.s virgin islands or whatever i

1617
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,040
think it's um

1618
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,720
and that's where some of what you were

1619
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,920
talking about in the culture of

1620
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,920
documentation and testing

1621
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,440
is really important so i'm glad you've

1622
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,040
connected those things together

1623
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,720
thanks both there were great questions

1624
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,839
coming yeah

1625
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,960
awesome thank you and i did want to also

1626
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,480
highlight someone mentioned

1627
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,760
um that it's simple and inexpensive to

1628
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,920
create an aluminum labeling system

1629
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,359
it can be done with an arduino and a

1630
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,960
nail to engrave which

1631
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,359
i think is why uh even kat was saying

1632
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:28,480
this is an exciting

1633
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,000
um there's some exciting potential

1634
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
around that so i love to see

1635
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,240
that the community thinks so as well all

1636
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,079
right so we're just

1637
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:38,400
about to be out of time let me see if

1638
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,280
there was

1639
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,000
one or two last questions here um

1640
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:48,079
[Music]

1641
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,680
i think we're all good um i just want to

1642
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,000
reiterate that we would love to have

1643
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,680
community support through

1644
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,079
the i o page you can directly

1645
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:58,799
communicate

1646
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,480
with the dream team through that page

1647
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,240
you can comment your suggestions you can

1648
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,240
see what ways you can get involved

1649
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,280
um this is all uh going to be an

1650
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,960
open source it's an entirely open source

1651
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,799
solution in the spirit of hackaday

1652
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:14,079
and so we would love to have um more uh

1653
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,799
people contributing and welcome any any

1654
