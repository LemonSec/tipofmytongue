00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,200
hi how's it going hi how are you good

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,049
we're here with Dustin and chief Dave

4
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,640
from Cal earth and we're really excited

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,570
to ask a few questions and really dive

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,010
into the challenges and hopefully

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,710
provide some additional context and

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,390
answer some questions that people may

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,060
have around what we've sort of

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,650
collaborated on and developed with them

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,000
for the hackaday Prize this year so

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,070
thank you for taking the time to do this

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,070
and I'm really excited to just get

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,660
started and learn more about how these

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,530
ideas came about and what the

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,570
inspiration was for what we're

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,100
challenging our community to do this

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,860
year so thank you very much we're very

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,420
honored and happy to be part of this

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,820
process and look forward to seeing what

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,219
kind of brilliant innovations come from

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,059
our minds definitely I think we can

23
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,280
easily just get started with a little

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,520
foundational question about Kyle earth

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,950
for those who don't know too much about

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,510
your organization I think it'd be good

27
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,460
to hear a little bit about how it

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,259
started and sort of what your current

29
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,810
projects are and what the mission of of

30
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,740
Cal earth is so cal earth was founded by

31
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,750
our father not our khalili in 1991 as a

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,040
educational research institute dedicated

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,340
to Earth architecture so since that time

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,280
our father passed away in 2008 and NASA

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,780
and I have been running the Institute

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,689
since then and we've had you know tens

37
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,280
of thousands of students and visitors

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,040
and people who have little to no

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,320
experience in architecture or

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,630
engineering who come and studied and

41
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,390
helped us develop this range of really

42
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,970
amazing research and educational tools

43
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,810
how to build using sandbags and just the

44
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,810
material that's local soil that's local

45
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,090
to an environment to build these

46
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,909
beautiful

47
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,260
so some of the UN here's some of the

48
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,508
projects that we have going on so we do

49
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,640
workshops we have tours open house

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,940
obviously in a non co-ed time we have

51
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,190
many different opportunities for people

52
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,290
to come and take classes with us one-day

53
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,200
workshops week-long weekend you know we

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,000
have a 12-week apprenticeship twice a

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,560
year we also have programs

56
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,260
internationally we also do relief

57
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,050
efforts and different kinds of research

58
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,600
to try to meet the needs across the

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,459
world so you know and someone that has

60
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,709
like a high rain environment and you

61
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,220
know fire prone areas etc earthquake you

62
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,900
know these these shelters are designed

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,769
to withstand all types of natural and

64
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,720
man-made disasters and we continue to

65
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,300
reason to research and innovate to push

66
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,380
the envelope of this technology and you

67
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,060
were just telling me that you guys have

68
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,550
been able to continue this programming

69
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,140
online during the time of quarantine

70
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,890
which i think is really awesome and it's

71
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,630
a whole other level of accessibility

72
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,500
that you guys have always sort of had

73
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,590
you've had the platform for but you've

74
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,010
been able to reach even more people with

75
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,510
everything going on right now so I think

76
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,450
that's great to to mention always been

77
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,890
like the top priority right

78
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,930
affordability accessibility we say it's

79
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,070
important for people to be able to

80
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,440
participate in this process building

81
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,840
their own homes shelter is a basic human

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,209
right so we continue to try to simplify

83
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,040
and make it so that anyone can

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,100
participate in this process we send the

85
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,989
online classes for free to anyone that

86
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,180
can't afford to pay for them and it's

87
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,310
really about getting this to the people

88
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,660
who need it the most and who are

89
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,459
interested in learning yeah I think

90
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,049
that's really wonderful and I think it's

91
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,519
a good sort of segue into the next

92
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,420
question because we're I think this

93
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,840
question or this challenge the open call

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,260
challenge really came out of our

95
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,579
discussions early on about all the sort

96
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,140
of different kinds of communities you

97
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,970
guys serve and different sort of

98
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,730
applications of the super Adobe dome

99
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,269
structures so I think that we can just

100
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,420
get into that so the challenge is just

101
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,640
to reiterate design modular add-ons for

102
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,139
colors

103
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,298
super adobe dome housing models within

104
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:21,978
the categories of connectivity power

105
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:24,050
harvesting lighting heating water

106
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,050
collection and storage and I think this

107
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,129
really is a nice bridge of what your

108
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:32,840
organization does and thinking about

109
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,900
what the hackaday community is really

110
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,430
inspired by and the types of projects

111
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,509
they'd like to work on so I'm really

112
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:40,759
excited to see what they do and I think

113
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,110
you'd be great to just hear a little bit

114
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,599
more about where the inspiration came

115
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:47,330
from your end I know when we were

116
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,680
talking about these things are a few

117
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,699
sort of examples of ways that people

118
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:55,580
wanted to maybe upgrade their structures

119
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,099
or you know thought of something that

120
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,569
might be missing they wanted to add it

121
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:01,669
on and it'd be nice for them to have

122
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,729
sort of a roadmap so if you guys want to

123
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:06,379
elaborate on that a little bit our work

124
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:09,139
is to empower the individual to be able

125
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:12,289
to live in harmony with nature not only

126
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,020
a sustainable but sustainable but also a

127
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,719
regenerative lifestyle using natural

128
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,339
materials and that begins with the idea

129
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,050
that everything you need is already on

130
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,610
the site and is available in the

131
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,250
environment so we started looking at it

132
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,620
from that particular perspective you

133
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,139
realize that you're very very very

134
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:32,569
highly resourced and you don't need to

135
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,330
bring so many things from the outside

136
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,759
what we're saying is that yes there's

137
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,430
many ways to build and that's okay but

138
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,139
we're presenting an alternative taking

139
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,189
the best from the past the existing

140
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:47,779
technologies that have shown resilience

141
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:50,089
over millennia and moving it into the

142
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,039
future because calor its innovations

143
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,909
were originally designed for off-planet

144
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,349
habitation through work with NASA which

145
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:02,089
my father did for the Moon and Mars so

146
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:03,740
if you bring all of this together you

147
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,419
should be able to build yourself a

148
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:07,879
sustainable home where you can harvest

149
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,009
sunlight where you can harvest water

150
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,560
where you can not only have a kind of

151
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,689
independent grid but also put energy

152
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,930
back into the main grid to reduce carbon

153
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,659
footprint in construction alone there is

154
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:23,319
it somewhere between 25 to 35 percent

155
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,639
carbon footprint just from shipping

156
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,519
materials and creating them so imagine

157
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,779
if you can build homes in communities

158
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:31,040
where

159
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,380
90% of what you need is already there

160
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,740
and so the individual is empowered by

161
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,980
being able to look differently at the

162
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,600
location where they're building and when

163
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,060
you see some visa eyes then there's

164
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,220
infinite possibilities to live a

165
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,380
regenerative and sustainable lifestyle

166
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,380
so we're very excited to do these

167
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,480
add-ons and these innovations to move

168
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,520
towards that ultimate goal and I would

169
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,470
just add to that and say that you know

170
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,120
what's been really exciting about

171
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,370
building and developing these super

172
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,140
Adobe structures and we focused almost

173
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,970
exclusively on butt to the building

174
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,000
technology over the past you know 28 30

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,910
years and really now is the time that

176
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,310
we're continuing to think about the way

177
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,040
to integrate with other types of

178
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,330
technologies that are out there and find

179
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,940
low-cost solutions so that you can have

180
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,590
sort of upgrades in these different ways

181
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,590
this eco dome that I'm inside of here

182
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,960
virtually you can see there's a built in

183
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,390
hinge that's on the wall and the bedroom

184
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,460
that's in the back there's this rocket

185
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,810
stove behind me which is a

186
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,060
high-efficiency heating system there's a

187
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,950
passive cooling system which is this

188
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,010
window here it opens to a wind scoop and

189
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,600
you know there's a lot of possibilities

190
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,120
but I think really thinking through you

191
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,070
know integrating technology integrating

192
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,260
other things that people are continuing

193
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,410
to want the comforts of sort of you know

194
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,010
modern living now but in a tiny earthen

195
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,530
setting and I and I think that that's

196
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,510
the exciting opportunity especially if

197
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,490
we can find some low-cost solutions that

198
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,890
are accessible to people even in remote

199
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,290
areas when we're building for you know

200
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,360
an emergency situation if we can bring

201
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,090
you know Wi-Fi or whatever it might be

202
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,520
but learning how to integrate those in

203
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,330
and add things on to the super Adobe in

204
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,550
a really quick and easy way will allow

205
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,020
all of our students and apprentices

206
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,450
around the world to be able to do so

207
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,080
much more

208
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,230
once the houses is finished to really

209
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,140
make it livable and comfortable and as

210
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,430
that's almost saying you know

211
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,820
sustainable and even giving back in

212
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,159
terms of the power harvesting and the

213
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,809
lighting and solar and whatever it might

214
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,640
be

215
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,809
right I think that's a really well put

216
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,219
and I think you guys have already sort

217
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:44,630
of started to cover

218
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,570
you know the ideas around not just being

219
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,910
a sustainable solution but affordable

220
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,300
and scalable could you explain a little

221
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,010
bit more like what that looks like to

222
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,410
you I think you know low-cost and

223
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,570
affordable is really relative so maybe

224
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,170
even giving us some examples or

225
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,200
anecdotes of specific groups of people

226
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,630
that you think you know this price point

227
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,550
or this level of accessibility or these

228
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,480
resources would be available and what

229
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,430
may be scalability looks like is that

230
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,490
for you know how many people what types

231
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,690
of communities sure so you know I think

232
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,640
that we have to think of it it's sort of

233
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,800
twofold we have the full spectrum of

234
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,900
people who are interested in this

235
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,660
architecture people who are living on a

236
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,660
high-end super sustainable home with

237
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,660
without you know sparing any detail and

238
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,540
then we are also looking for ways to

239
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,430
take this technology to remote areas

240
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,170
where they don't even they can't even

241
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,020
bring in machinery so how can we create

242
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,870
something that can sort of work in both

243
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,080
context and I think designing for both

244
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,240
with both in mind whether you want to

245
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,060
design for the low cost or the you know

246
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,120
sort of the middle class I guess you

247
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,910
could say is both very important because

248
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,760
you you want to be able to you can argue

249
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,470
that absolutely everyone deserves to

250
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,510
live with integrity and so why shouldn't

251
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,300
you have access to different kinds of

252
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,680
technology or amenities just because

253
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,630
you're only able to afford it you know

254
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,940
sort of a smaller type of home or

255
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,920
shelter so we're looking for things that

256
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,280
will work in a disaster situation that

257
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,410
we could quickly add on to a six foot

258
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,450
emergency shelter that's put on it put

259
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,040
up in a day by a bunch of people

260
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,500
volunteers as well as something that can

261
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,230
go into like a modern like the house

262
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,270
that Don's in front of this really

263
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,540
beautiful modular multi dome sort of

264
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,590
luxury type of home without losing the

265
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,720
integrity of the architecture you know

266
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,520
what's really interesting about this

267
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,250
work based on your question is that the

268
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,810
other thing about it making it

269
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,750
affordable because you're using natural

270
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,950
materials in 90

271
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,350
it's coming from your site and if you

272
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,150
need to do very small-scale stuff you

273
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,390
can build just earth if you want to get

274
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,950
building department approval and things

275
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,230
like that there is usually about a 10 to

276
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,400
15 percent integration of cement or lime

277
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,390
to stabilize it for their calculation

278
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,980
needs but for one third of the cost of a

279
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,710
home today you can build a house like

280
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,870
this and the other benefit of it is that

281
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,880
once you've paid off your 3040 year

282
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,340
mortgage the house is not dilapidated

283
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,830
the structure lasts for generations and

284
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,290
generations and generations and then the

285
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,810
final thing regarding affordability is

286
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,690
that with the advent of climate change

287
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,150
in all of the natural events that are

288
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,010
occurring and getting larger and larger

289
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,830
and scale when you want to live in a

290
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,160
house that's fireproof hurricane proof

291
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,720
earthquake resistance works in harmony

292
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,980
with nature can harness the available

293
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,880
resources of nature and at the same time

294
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,850
be sustainable regenerative and

295
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,260
harmonious to living and not only that

296
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,840
but beautiful so these are the things

297
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,850
that not only on a financial scale make

298
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,770
it affordable and reasonable but also

299
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,260
long-term generational because you can

300
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,760
pass it down from generation to

301
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,310
generation and that's the beauty of

302
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,520
working with birth thank you and so have

303
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,520
there been examples in the field or by

304
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,500
some of your maybe students that people

305
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,560
have created versions of these modular

306
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,170
add-ons whether they be hardware or

307
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,280
maybe not Hardware examples I know you

308
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,000
mentioned the even the the stove in the

309
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,190
Eco dome I think is a great example but

310
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,760
any other you could say either you know

311
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,410
popular things that people have

312
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,180
continued to iterate on or things that

313
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,460
have been missing that people may be

314
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,260
asked for or are interested in

315
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,690
developing just to give give our

316
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,720
audience some ideas potentially sure so

317
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,450
I would say you know the the things that

318
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,060
we've really focused on as primary are

319
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,800
heating and cooling I mean

320
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,230
something that we've really tried to to

321
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,240
be able to address and that's that's

322
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,399
been the primary right as I said that

323
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,250
rocket stove that's in the Eco dome is a

324
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,990
well known technology and very

325
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,640
affordable and that's always been the

326
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,470
key is yes we've we've figured out how

327
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,540
to install a full central heating and

328
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,690
air-conditioning system into a Super

329
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,550
Adobe structure but that's not

330
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,320
necessarily accessible or the most

331
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,300
sustainable way to heat or cool a house

332
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,420
of this type and so people are

333
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,769
interested in things like thermal

334
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:43,220
flooring and how do you add on solar

335
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,200
panels to the outside water harvesting

336
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,500
options things like that and you know

337
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,570
beyond that we've we found some really

338
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,390
creative sort of attaching an outdoor

339
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,360
shower and that's attached to a solar

340
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,130
panel that heats the you know there's a

341
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,820
lot of really creative ideas that have

342
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,220
been integrated into Super Adobe we

343
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,240
figured out you can pretty much

344
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,600
integrate most of the modern things you

345
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,700
know electricity plumbing all of that

346
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,920
it's just figuring it out and being

347
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,190
thoughtful about it but there is a lot

348
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,770
of things that we haven't just gotten to

349
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,240
yet and I think things that we just

350
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,100
haven't thought about that maybe are

351
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,810
more modern things that people are

352
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,390
adding on to their homes and you know

353
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,459
that are more common in maybe a middle

354
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,399
class or upper middle class types of

355
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
households you know smart houses right

356
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,880
we haven't really gone down that path at

357
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,709
all for example as I sort of how do you

358
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,020
make it not only sustainable but like a

359
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,600
high-tech kind of a house or you know

360
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,670
that could be really interesting one

361
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,470
issue we have that I could share is that

362
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,950
because of the thickness of the walls

363
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,660
Wi-Fi doesn't transmit very well from

364
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,730
one end of a Super Adobe structure to

365
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,260
the other which in a lot of ways is

366
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,850
great because you know that you know the

367
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,190
whatever is not flowing throughout the

368
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,709
building but if you want to have Wi-Fi

369
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,630
in all of your bedrooms across your

370
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,360
whole super Adobe house we haven't

371
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,459
really thought that much about kind of

372
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,769
how you might do that yeah I think

373
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:11,510
that's a great insight and something

374
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,820
that will definitely inspire some of the

375
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,750
entrants to tackle hopefully I think

376
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,709
that's a good

377
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:22,170
that's you know one of many constraints

378
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,079
we've started to mention here you guys

379
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:31,019
also covered sort of being able to work

380
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,389
in different environments different

381
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,360
kinds of weather conditions we've you

382
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,050
know covered affordability

383
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,769
sustainability are there any other

384
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:42,660
constraints you think are worth

385
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,399
mentioning something that comes to mind

386
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,619
for me is also maybe sort of mobility in

387
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:52,769
a way or either being able to send some

388
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:54,809
of these add-ons easily so maybe light

389
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:58,769
weight packable or break down a bowl and

390
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:00,059
that comes I think back to the

391
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,790
modularity but also maybe there's

392
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,649
something that you have the instructions

393
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:06,059
and the components and then you're able

394
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,839
to quickly and easily build on site or

395
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,100
in the field depending on the case just

396
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,959
just just a little bit of background to

397
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,809
be to make this clear is that the the

398
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:21,480
essential purpose of calories and what

399
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,790
our father began from the beginning was

400
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,790
based on housing availability globally

401
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,499
today there's over something like 1.2

402
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:33,860
1.3 billion homeless people in the world

403
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,480
so our base foundation is a humanitarian

404
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,129
addressing the humanitarian issue and

405
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:44,069
part of that what we've come up with is

406
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,920
called in the beta phase is called a

407
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,800
duffel bag dome where you can take 235

408
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,929
pound duffel bags on any commercial

409
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:53,610
flight and go to anywhere in the world

410
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,069
and with one instructor in three days

411
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:59,429
build a small structure and train 15

412
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:01,920
people and then from that those trained

413
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,929
people not only will have a structure

414
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,640
but they will also be able to continue

415
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,549
to build and train as far as add-on goes

416
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,770
the most important thing is that it is

417
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,909
as simple and plugging play as possible

418
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,799
over complexity in too many directions

419
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,779
and things like that will make it

420
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:21,029
difficult considering who you're

421
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:23,609
delivering it to if you're doing housing

422
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,890
construction and you have contractors

423
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,079
and engineers and builders available

424
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,020
then we can do you know hybridization

425
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,390
and all that but delivery system

426
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,520
and simplicity is the heat which is the

427
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,980
essence of this work because what makes

428
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,590
it so effective you're using earth

429
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,260
purely you're basically only bringing

430
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,260
sandbags barbed wire and a couple of

431
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,850
tools and you're building the whole

432
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,540
structure so with that in mind and the

433
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,340
concept of everything you need is in the

434
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,150
environment

435
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,620
if the add-ons have that kind of base

436
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,230
foundation idea of simplicity which

437
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,620
makes it very elegant like this work

438
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,850
effective and something that anybody

439
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,870
could understand that would be really

440
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,390
the winning ticket yeah I think this has

441
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,360
been really good for additional context

442
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,580
for the entrance and starting to plant

443
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,400
those seeds of what's possible and you

444
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,920
know what the main focus should be as

445
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,900
far as though being in line with your

446
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,530
organization's mission so I think we can

447
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,630
move on next to the dream team challenge

448
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,440
which again will be was you know

449
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,840
designed with sort of dream team of

450
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,170
three designers engineers makers in mind

451
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,990
who will be dedicated to working on this

452
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,410
this challenge for a 2-month engineering

453
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,230
sprint so what we've developed with you

454
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,290
all at colors is modular solutions that

455
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,480
automate steps in the super adobe dome

456
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,400
construction in order to make the

457
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,530
process more efficient less taxing or

458
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,980
more cost effective so I think right off

459
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,300
the bat something that would be useful

460
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,420
is sort of breaking down the steps in

461
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,390
building a super adobe don't structure

462
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,990
just to lay that that that groundwork

463
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,540
and then we can elaborate from there on

464
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,330
a few points Super adobe is it's a very

465
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,720
simple building technology but it can be

466
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,560
labor-intensive if you don't have any

467
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,390
machinery right it's designed to be done

468
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,910
completely by hand you can hand mix

469
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,300
everything you can you know you fill

470
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,400
every stand back one by one it's a long

471
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,860
sand bag you could just do it one scoop

472
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,810
of Earth at a time it requires every

473
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,410
Laird has to be tamp down so it

474
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,440
stays sturdy and then you lay a course

475
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,480
of barbed wire between each of the rows

476
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,730
that's what provides that tensile

477
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,730
strength that keeps the building safe

478
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,950
against Wright earthquakes and seismic

479
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,500
and in each of those stages there is

480
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,100
quite a bit of you know sweat that goes

481
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,290
into it and we've come up with lots of

482
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,840
ways to you know make it lighter and so

483
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
on we've made it accessible that we use

484
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,940
small buckets to carry a coffee can of

485
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,980
soil at a time so if you can't carry

486
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,630
heavy weight that's okay

487
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,880
we've simplified it but that doesn't

488
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,930
mean that it's necessarily um you know

489
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:23,300
sped up or mechanized without just more

490
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,120
people working a little bit harder so we

491
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,910
are continuing continually interested in

492
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,450
finding ways to automate certain steps

493
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,220
how do you make it possible maybe for

494
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,990
one person if they don't have anybody

495
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,480
else to build it by themselves for

496
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,890
example and that's been that's been

497
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,630
asked a couple of times you know we have

498
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,550
people that you can't always get a whole

499
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,470
group of volunteers together right many

500
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,870
hands make light work but you don't have

501
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,540
20 friends to come and help you carry

502
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,730
little coffee cans and you have to carry

503
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,880
a lot more by yourself so yeah we're

504
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,710
just looking at more ways to make it

505
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,260
more efficient you know so that yeah if

506
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,850
you're in a remote environment what if

507
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,530
you don't have all the tools could you

508
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,740
make some of the tools could you you

509
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,720
know I don't know there and again this

510
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,250
is we've continued it we do it the same

511
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,930
way all the time we teach it the same

512
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,030
way and so it's almost like we need a

513
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,310
fresh set of eyes some people to come in

514
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,050
and think about it and be really

515
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,880
creative and and see if there's

516
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,970
something that we've missed which I'll

517
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,530
tell a quick story which is that my

518
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,960
father and his early students they used

519
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,420
to take individual rice bags that were

520
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,700
60 pounds each they would fill them all

521
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,650
up one by one with sand

522
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,230
somebody was sew it shut pick it up and

523
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,750
put it on the wall and it took many

524
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,180
months of that it was a purely you know

525
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,940
labor kind of environment men only very

526
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,270
construction some firefighters came saw

527
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,920
what he was doing and and

528
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,050
and you know you should put empty bags

529
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,760
on the wall and fill them a shovel at a

530
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,620
time and that's when we switch to the

531
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,900
coffee can technique right that sort of

532
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,550
you know you don't need to sew the bag

533
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,230
shut you could just twist it and put it

534
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,050
down and something as simple as that has

535
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,240
saved time money made this accessible

536
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,550
kids are participating people with any

537
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,250
kind of physical disability can

538
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,440
participate we've we've really found

539
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,350
ways around a lot of the the strain and

540
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,510
our students are almost 50/50 split men

541
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,550
and women all ages all backgrounds and

542
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,380
that is the goal that we find ways to

543
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,720
involve the entire community in the

544
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,080
process right I think that that's a

545
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,110
really nice sort of example of like you

546
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,670
are saying having a fresh set of eyes

547
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,910
maybe look at the the picture at a

548
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,040
little bit of a different angle and

549
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,810
we're hoping that's what our community

550
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,490
will be able to bring to the challenge

551
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,870
for sure

552
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,210
I think you've you've really started to

553
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,720
cover you know the impact that potential

554
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,580
solutions to this challenge will have on

555
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,980
the the people you guys work with and

556
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,260
what you know the impact of even just

557
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,300
the the changes you guys have developed

558
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,070
over the last thirty years have had in

559
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,530
this area so I think it'd be great to

560
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,990
hear maybe what are some of the key

561
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,720
skills you would imagine this this dream

562
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,270
team having just to give an idea to

563
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,610
potential applicants what they might

564
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,870
want to have in mind I think definitely

565
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,390
like we're saying fresh perspective kind

566
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,490
of creative thinker who's open to

567
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,740
developing concepts and doesn't maybe

568
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,780
need all the you know the answers off

569
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,560
the bat this isn't just you know build

570
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,110
this device to these specifications kind

571
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,950
of an ask this is much more of you know

572
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:35,180
dynamic I think challenge so any other

573
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,550
skills you think would be useful in that

574
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,240
regard well I think that the skills that

575
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,010
would be useful other than of course

576
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,140
having engineering mind and design

577
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,080
elements is being visionary and and

578
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,480
having kind of a eagled perspective of

579
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,480
harvesting available natural resources

580
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,660
you know light solar for energy or water

581
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,060
and then being able to apply that in a

582
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,810
very simple

583
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,800
elegant way so that anybody could could

584
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,340
integrate that so it's more of an a

585
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,070
fearlessness kind of being gutsy to just

586
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,710
experiment because you know that's how

587
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,990
all of this came about you know our

588
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,330
father developed this work in the middle

589
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,720
of a revolution and a war in the desert

590
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,900
lighting entire buildings on fire and

591
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,130
burning them while there are planes

592
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,500
flying over bombing a nearby city

593
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,700
you know but but it so the work has a

594
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,300
certain sense to it that anything is

595
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,540
possible this is waiting for you so I

596
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,420
would say in a broad stroke it's more of

597
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:50,600
a mind state and an idea based approach

598
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,840
than necessarily any specific skills but

599
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,370
though she if they can elaborate more on

600
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:59,780
skill sets yeah you know one other fun

601
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,550
story that we might want to share is

602
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,230
that you know this work had reached a

603
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,260
certain point and my father was he he

604
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,420
kept reaching points that were sort of

605
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,060
where he would get stuck and stop and be

606
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,980
stressed out and so you know sort of I

607
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,740
can't innovate any further and one story

608
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,180
he would always tell is that every

609
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,340
architect has a fear of cracks in their

610
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,930
building that when they see a crack that

611
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,090
means it's a failure and you know he was

612
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,010
really trying to figure out how do you

613
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,070
how do you push past that fear and what

614
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,150
is it about that

615
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,310
and so when he did is he look to nature

616
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,790
and he noticed how no surfaces on you

617
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,910
know trees and reptiles have smooth

618
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,280
surfaces they all have cracked surfaces

619
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,650
and so he then vivid and he started

620
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,630
designing cracked surfaces he put

621
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,240
reticle at ret tiling on the outsides of

622
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,950
his buildings and he said well let's you

623
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,870
know sort of embrace it and go with it

624
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,700
that instead of being limited by

625
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,830
something like that to then design it in

626
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,650
and to carry on right that I think you

627
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,650
know there is there's so much space to

628
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,900
innovate when there are no limits

629
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,120
because the entire technology is based

630
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,830
on pushing the envelope and we we

631
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,990
continue to now we have proof of concept

632
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,790
I mean in the early days he didn't he

633
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,980
couldn't he was speaking basically

634
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,750
radical and now we've seen these

635
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,149
structures go through the earthquakes in

636
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:23,090
Nepal 7.2 7.3 to go through the Tamas

637
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,220
fires in Ventura County they went

638
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,620
through Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico

639
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,139
and so on and so forth and they

640
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:32,510
withstand we know they do so now it's

641
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,700
just time for us to kind of you know

642
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,100
clean them up aesthetically and continue

643
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,380
to be creative but you're working with

644
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,380
something that that is sort of foolproof

645
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,269
and it's designed to to be there's a lot

646
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:49,580
of room wiggle room in it right you know

647
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,960
it's we always say the walls are a

648
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,190
little crooked the floors are a little

649
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,450
crooked but that's what makes it

650
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,950
beautiful right if you look to nature

651
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,110
there's not perfection is not the goal

652
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,409
it's it's access and affordability and

653
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:02,870
the safety is there we know that's there

654
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,279
so we don't have to worry about that

655
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,080
anymore

656
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,460
right I really love that story I

657
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,399
remember seeing some of the images when

658
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:12,409
I first was learning more about collars

659
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:15,559
and seeing that the he said it was

660
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,809
reptilian sort of time styling you add

661
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:19,880
the the mounds that were built on

662
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,710
together and I think that's really

663
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,779
inspiring and helps people sort of get

664
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:26,179
into the might the right you know mind

665
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,309
space like you're saying of feeling you

666
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:29,659
know limitless and also thinking about

667
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:31,970
how as you know designers and innovators

668
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,440
we can embrace what's happening what's

669
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,909
not really happening instead of trying

670
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:39,080
to fight it all the time because I think

671
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,360
sometimes there's definitely an

672
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,240
inclination to yeah to buff it out to

673
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,669
fix it to make it shiny and that's not

674
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:48,049
the sort of thing we need in this

675
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:50,690
context so I think that's a great point

676
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,659
for sure the potential for tools like we

677
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:55,820
said to help out with this process so

678
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,649
not necessarily thinking maybe of how to

679
00:27:57,649 --> 00:27:59,210
automate some of those steps you

680
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,389
mentioned earlier but how to make the

681
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,299
the planning or the calculations or the

682
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:08,240
drawings a more efficient process or

683
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,000
more user-friendly so I think that was

684
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,620
an excellent point and something that

685
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,250
can definitely be a nice access point

686
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,760
for people to start thinking about was

687
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,200
there anything else you guys wanted to

688
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,889
mention as far as some of those earlier

689
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:26,659
conversations ideas that had come up

690
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:28,820
yeah the right data estimation

691
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,230
that's a really interesting one that's a

692
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,509
different type of engineering and you

693
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:34,100
know people want to know how many sand

694
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,779
but how much sand bike do I need how

695
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:38,480
much material how do I estimate the cost

696
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,399
and and those are also things that we

697
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,630
continue to develop so yeah and I know

698
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,179
that we're we're gonna have one of our

699
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:49,730
team members serve as a mentor and I

700
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,200
think that that will be really great as

701
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,909
well he'll be able to he's one of our

702
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:55,220
main builders who has a lot of his

703
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,139
hands-on experience and can speak to

704
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:58,940
some of the different things that have

705
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,580
come up in the field um something else

706
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,909
to think about is that we we have at Cal

707
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,309
Earth every tool at our disposal every

708
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:09,500
way of building all of our formwork you

709
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,090
know that each of these windows requires

710
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,309
a wooden form and but then we always

711
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:15,080
tell our team you're spoiled here

712
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,580
because we're gonna send you out into

713
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,259
the world where these things are not

714
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:20,629
easy to find or people don't know

715
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:22,820
they're not familiar with them so the

716
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,379
more things that we can take with us

717
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:26,120
like that's not saying that what can we

718
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,830
put in a duffle bag what what kind of

719
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,480
instructions can we put together so

720
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,419
someone can build a form out of whatever

721
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:34,610
scrap materials or you know anything

722
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,159
like that that we can put the entire

723
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:39,769
system in a way that wherever you go you

724
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:42,169
can find a way to figure it out you have

725
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:45,379
to be scrappy to get it done because the

726
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:47,269
reality is that some of the places that

727
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:49,490
need this the most they're not gonna be

728
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,230
able to access those things very easily

729
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,629
so we're happy to take it with us there

730
00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:55,909
if it's lightweight and affordable and

731
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:58,960
easy to figure out in field under

732
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,399
basically the opposite of ideal

733
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,960
conditions you know what's very

734
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,370
interesting is that this whole process

735
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,679
and thank you so much all of you guys

736
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,059
for making this happen

737
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,029
this whole process ultimately is going

738
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:15,769
to come together in some kind of a

739
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:18,830
software application where you'll be

740
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,809
able to crunch data you'll be able to

741
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:23,629
get instructions you'll be able to you

742
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:26,450
know have live chats find different

743
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,669
people who are available in the

744
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:30,200
community around you because our

745
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,269
community is global at this point we've

746
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:34,159
seen so many people there's so many

747
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,809
people around the world there's not a

748
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:38,179
country you can't go to right now where

749
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:39,409
there's somebody from calor

750
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:41,330
there and you can reach out to that it's

751
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:41,850
done

752
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,780
and so I'm very very excited to see the

753
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,520
innovations that are coming because

754
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,410
ultimately it's all going to go into

755
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,179
this kind of software application

756
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,750
technology base where then it will truly

757
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:59,100
be accessible to anyone anywhere and all

758
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,010
my father would always say when you take

759
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,020
a workshop and you're done I should be

760
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,610
able to drop you anywhere in the world

761
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,820
and you can start building and so that

762
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,690
simple elegant idea is the basis of this

763
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,940
so I really look forward to seeing what

764
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,909
our innovators come up with to enhance

765
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,650
that experience so that not only are we

766
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,480
harvesting the earth and using the most

767
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,580
available a natural available material

768
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,559
under our feet but everything else from

769
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,929
the Sun and the water and you know any

770
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,490
other things that they think of and

771
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,260
that's a very beautiful and exciting

772
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,690
thing so thank you for all the wonderful

773
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,059
stories and the insights and like you

774
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,280
said we're gonna have a mentor from your

775
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,809
team which we're so excited about that

776
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:41,549
as well they'll be mentor session

777
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:44,220
opportunities throughout the the

778
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,610
challenge open call period and also the

779
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,590
mentor will be working with what the

780
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,030
dream team as well to answer any

781
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,179
questions along the way so again I can't

782
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,860
say how much you know we appreciate you

783
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,419
guys being involved I'm really excited

784
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:00,179
to be working with color on the 20/20

785
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:03,210
hackaday prize and super excited to see

786
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,309
what everyone brings to the table once

787
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:07,530
we once we open it up thank you again

788
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,510
for inviting us and I just want to say

789
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,789
that the thing that I think I appreciate

790
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:13,580
the most about this process that's

791
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,510
absolutely in alignment with our

792
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,330
organization is the open source of this

793
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,309
work that everything that we come up

794
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:21,990
with that you're innovators are gonna

795
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,059
come up with it's gonna be accessible to

796
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:27,059
everybody else and that's absolutely the

797
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:28,830
the mission of this organization and the

798
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,270
work that we're trying to do is that

799
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,070
this is about finding solutions and then

800
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,659
getting them to the people who need them

801
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,630
so we look forward to you know seeing

802
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,030
all those new solutions and helping to

803
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,039
spread that all around the world to the

804
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,690
people that are already building with

805
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,179
this technology and you know maybe don't

806
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,010
have those resources to figure it out on

807
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,900
their own so thank you for it for

808
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,600
involving us in this process yeah I

809
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,610
think that is the perfect note to end on

810
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,270
Thanks
