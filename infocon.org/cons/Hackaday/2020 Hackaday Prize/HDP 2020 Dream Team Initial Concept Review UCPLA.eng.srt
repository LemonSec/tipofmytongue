00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,519
these teams and who will give you an

60
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,599
introduction to the challenge that the

61
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,200
ucpla dream

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,319
team put forth

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,800
thank you magenta and hello everyone i

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
am really happy to be here today for the

65
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,319
first abstract

66
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,319
and concept review for the dream team

67
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,440
challenge

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,879
the ucpla team includes kelvin

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,120
in toronto canada ruben in colorado usa

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,640
and natalya in boston usa

71
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,640
so hi guys it's great to see you here

72
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,840
now the ucpla challenge asks the team to

73
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,480
design

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,519
a new type of universal remote that

75
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,599
meets the needs of the physical

76
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,239
challenges of people with cerebral palsy

77
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,800
and integrates with modern electronics

78
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,360
like

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,000
smart tvs workstations and other digital

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,959
devices

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,000
in as few steps as possible now while

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,480
the

83
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,519
definition of this challenge sounds

84
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,640
narrow in the world of usability

85
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,440
it becomes really broad so additionally

86
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,120
one of the biggest and more

87
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,159
frustrating challenges is cost also for

88
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:44,879
this kind of

89
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,920
devices so after a lot of research

90
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
and trying to understand the user's

91
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,760
challenges the team

92
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,720
reinterpreted it to developing an

93
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,920
affordable

94
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,879
open source platform to democratize

95
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,159
assistive technology

96
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,599
for interacting with the digital world

97
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,040
during the first three weeks of work

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,799
the team has done a lot of research in

99
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,879
the field and started brainstorming

100
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,840
potential solutions

101
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,439
the the idea of today's meeting with

102
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,720
stephanie and rania

103
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,759
is to present the results of this

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,639
research

105
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,280
and start discussing our first ideas

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,520
stephanie and irania we cannot thank you

107
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,000
enough

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,720
for for being here today and we are

109
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,320
really looking forward to hearing your

110
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,360
feedback

111
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,560
so uh without further ado i'll pass it

112
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
on to the team

113
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,440
hello i'm ruben keckster and i'll start

114
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,880
the presentation

115
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,359
which i believe is this one

116
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,560
there we go can everyone see my screen

117
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,400
very good so

118
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,280
thank you giovanni we're going to start

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,400
with a simple overview of the

120
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,199
of the project we're going to go through

121
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,400
a simple introduction

122
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,919
building off of what giovanni has

123
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,520
already said

124
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,680
touch on our design goals and then go

125
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
over each of the platforms that we feel

126
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,080
that

127
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,000
as as if we could bring them all

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,759
together could solve

129
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,840
the be the ultimate remote to solve all

130
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,400
the problems

131
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,560
our big mission as i said before is to

132
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
develop affordable open source platforms

133
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,400
that can bring specific technology to

134
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
everyone in the world everyone who needs

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,800
it

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,440
at an affordable price our potential

137
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,240
users have

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,479
such a drastic range of disabilities

139
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,360
that

140
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
it was a real challenge to try to figure

141
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,880
out what to focus on in the short time

142
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,639
that we have

143
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,479
and our target devices in this day and

144
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,800
age can range anywhere from

145
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
a simple tv controller that was around

146
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,000
50 years ago to

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,840
autonomous cars that are coming out

148
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,199
our design goals are centralized around

149
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,479
these few points

150
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,479
we want this again to be a universal

151
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,039
control interface with as many

152
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,600
connected devices as possible at least

153
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,080
those

154
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,479
that our users want to interact with the

155
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,000
most

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
accessibility it needs to be usually

157
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,800
easily usable by anyone

158
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,280
especially users with disabilities

159
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
portable needs to be able to

160
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,280
have a long battery life or be able to

161
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,720
charge easily

162
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,360
and even be mountable on on whatever

163
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,759
mode of transportation our users will

164
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,240
be using we would like it to be

165
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,199
expandable and

166
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,800
integrate with as many different input

167
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,639
methods as possible

168
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,759
as as again the range drastically

169
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,199
is a drastic range between different

170
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,120
usabilities that

171
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,360
whatever we decide needs to be able to

172
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,479
adapt to our

173
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,280
our users and with that it needs to have

174
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,560
functions and actions that are

175
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,479
customizable so the users can

176
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,759
pick and select and lay out whatever

177
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,560
this is to meet their needs as mentioned

178
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,039
before the cost is a big factor

179
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,720
especially in the world of accessibility

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
and we'll cover that more in the

181
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,000
other concepts and uh durability is a

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,039
huge factor too

183
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,520
as as users that have disabilities may

184
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,360
not apply the

185
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
may apply too much force and so it needs

186
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,479
to be very durable to

187
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,240
be able to stand up to the users

188
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,240
constant use our platform essentially

189
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
wants to be the middle man between two

190
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
worlds the the physical world where the

191
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,960
user

192
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,639
interacts with different kind of input

193
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,280
methods and the digital world which is

194
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,160
increasing and growing in a rapid rate

195
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,039
and there's so many

196
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,240
awesome projects out there but how do

197
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
you interface with them

198
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,199
that's hopefully we'll find a way to

199
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,599
bridge that gap

200
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,919
um this is a one proposal we came up

201
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,879
with

202
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,039
and it's um adaptive smart remote so

203
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,879
sticking to the name of the remote

204
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,560
what if we can make a remote that could

205
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,360
be truly used by everyone

206
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,440
target users in this case we're hoping

207
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,879
to find

208
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,280
we're targeting users that cannot use

209
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
existing devices without lots of effort

210
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,039
um they would need some sort of

211
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,879
accessibility

212
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,800
they it works best with someone that has

213
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,639
a line of sight with the device so they

214
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,199
can see

215
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,479
the the buttons and things they're

216
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,479
touching

217
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,840
and with touching they need to be able

218
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
to use some sort of uh digit

219
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,120
a knuckle a hand a fist to toe something

220
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,240
to interact with it

221
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,639
and again we are assuming our users want

222
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,319
to be able to use and operate this

223
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,840
device independently

224
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,919
without be able to get it out and use it

225
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,640
and move it around and

226
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,559
you know be their companion as needed

227
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,080
concept goals for this concept for this

228
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,799
proposal

229
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,519
is a versatile low-power device on

230
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
usable right out of the box no issue

231
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
no additional device or supporting

232
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,880
platforms required

233
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,800
at its bare minimum we hope to get it

234
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,399
out and be able to control

235
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,920
a tv this kind of interface would be

236
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,720
easiest

237
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,399
and intuitive for users with limited

238
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,640
mobility

239
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,000
the it would have unlimited functions by

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
using a display to show users what

241
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,880
functions are currently

242
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,640
assigned to each button and then you can

243
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,959
design and customize it to your arts

244
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,880
content

245
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,080
options are infinite we want it to be

246
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,800
integratable again with existing devices

247
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,839
easily expandable so touching on

248
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,640
meeting a lot of our target goals easily

249
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,279
expandable

250
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,240
different physical input methods and in

251
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,360
this case we could even include a

252
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
speaker that could be added for

253
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,279
additional

254
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,680
feedback and options one option would be

255
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,279
users could use the device's

256
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,720
assistive communication device where

257
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
each button may say or

258
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,920
or say something or a word or phrase

259
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,480
to help them communicate

260
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
the an original um concept of this has

261
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,560
existed

262
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,040
and has been tried and the users are

263
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,399
super grateful

264
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,360
the caretaker and the the primary user

265
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,240
absolutely

266
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,320
love the idea while it needs some

267
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,160
improvement they are really grateful to

268
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,720
have

269
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
something in their life anything to help

270
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,920
ease the struggle

271
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,079
and now it's time to bring it to the

272
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,760
next level in this case we're trying to

273
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,600
the concept be as simple as here's a

274
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
screen it's a tv remote

275
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,920
let's say we want to go to another

276
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,079
screen for more functions if the user

277
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,240
presses the far right button

278
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
the button on the display would

279
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,600
highlight and it would bring another

280
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
screen

281
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,480
so here the possibility is endless they

282
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,880
can flip through a book or page

283
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,560
like platform and and program it at as

284
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,839
many pages as they need and want

285
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,519
again for customizability and

286
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,880
expandability

287
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,600
the you could orient it in any way that

288
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,040
makes best sense for the user

289
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,480
right-handed left-handed

290
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,920
on the right-hand side we're showing

291
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,000
examples of adding external buttons or

292
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,200
joysticks or other

293
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,560
input methods if the onboard buttons

294
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,440
aren't quite or we would need more

295
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,839
options

296
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,240
uh some variations possibly variation

297
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,880
one would

298
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,560
would help alleviate the issue with

299
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
people that don't have

300
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,880
that line of sight required to use a

301
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,839
single system

302
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
the display unit could be the main

303
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,079
system mounted somewhere up higher

304
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,839
uh in their line of sight and then the

305
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,680
buttons or other inputs wouldn't have to

306
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,800
be this grid

307
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,399
could be wherever they would like it

308
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,120
another variation too we could thought

309
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,480
of is what if the buttons have the

310
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,320
displays built in

311
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,040
um that option would looks more like a

312
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,720
universal remote and would be

313
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,279
smaller more portable but it comes with

314
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,760
its own challenges

315
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,279
and now i'll turn the time over to

316
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,800
kelvin for the next

317
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,839
proposal hi thank you ruben

318
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,600
for this next proposal i want to build

319
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,920
off of ruben's modular expandable

320
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,440
concept and focus on

321
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,279
focus on developing a joystick based

322
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,120
module for operating computer

323
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,480
workstations

324
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
and accessing different computer

325
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,440
programs such as photoshop for

326
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,040
expressing creativity

327
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,959
web browsing for gaining knowledge or

328
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,800
connecting to online communities

329
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,279
or video games for recreation common

330
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,240
input devices

331
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,399
uh are mouse and keyboards and they're

332
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,160
not easy to use for a majority of this

333
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,200
population

334
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,560
so they might prefer something more

335
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,040
familiar such as a joystick

336
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,320
next slide so it seems existing

337
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,480
joysticks are a popular input device for

338
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,360
this community

339
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,200
and many users operate their motorized

340
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,639
wheelchair with the hand operated

341
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,760
joystick

342
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,279
so for our solution we want to present

343
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,440
something that has a familiar intuitive

344
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,240
interface

345
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,320
so it's more likely for users to adopt

346
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,279
and use

347
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,279
so then we ask the question why don't a

348
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,279
lot of users have assistive joysticks

349
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,320
for accessing

350
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,480
computers or tablets right now so when

351
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,519
you look at

352
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,920
looking at existing computer consumer

353
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,720
products

354
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,560
they do exist but it's just often at a

355
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,000
ridiculous price point

356
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,160
so for example the bluetooth joystick

357
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,920
for a tablet and phone that exists costs

358
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,519
about twelve hundred dollars

359
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,959
and if we're trying to identify the

360
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,639
biggest accessibility barrier

361
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,480
that restricts individuals with cerebral

362
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,200
palsy from accessing the digital world

363
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
that barrier just might be the cost

364
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,959
itself

365
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,399
next slide so one approach that is

366
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,160
pretty straightforward from our end

367
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,880
is to just focusing focus on overcoming

368
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,399
this cost barrier

369
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,399
to develop a level to develop a low-cost

370
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,839
bluetooth joystick that can

371
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,200
connect to computers tablets or phones

372
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
the first step would be to identify

373
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,639
off-the-shelf electronic components to

374
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,160
make a bluetooth joystick

375
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,320
including a joystick handle a bluetooth

376
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,200
micro cook

377
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,680
microcontroller and a few buttons what

378
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,519
we want to focus here is

379
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,440
on low cost aiming for a target of under

380
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,360
fifty dollars something that's easy to

381
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,000
assemble

382
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,279
and something that is easily

383
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,199
reproducible by others

384
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,639
so by the end of this project a very

385
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,639
feasible goal would be to deliver a few

386
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,440
standard

387
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,519
functioning bluetooth joysticks and then

388
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,040
we can take this a step further to

389
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,639
address ergonomics and make unique

390
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,519
joysticks

391
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,199
for each individual user next slide

392
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,880
so after we've identified the main

393
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,800
electronic components to make a diy

394
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,360
joystick the next step is to focusing

395
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,519
on mechanical components that affect

396
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,800
ergonomics

397
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,199
mainly the joystick handle so similar to

398
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,040
how you guys have developed a digital

399
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,199
library of three principle parts for

400
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,880
attaching painting tools for for

401
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,959
painting we could do something similar

402
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,600
for some for the joystick handles with

403
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
different designs

404
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
that are adjustable for different user

405
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,399
grips also different

406
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,360
hand sizes for so for a lot of these

407
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,000
existing

408
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,199
products first of all they're really

409
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,040
expensive so these handles could be like

410
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,079
200 dollars for

411
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,240
a piece of plastic and they're also

412
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,839
pretty generic

413
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,279
because they're made out of pretty

414
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,839
simple basic shapes and they're all

415
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,320
designed very symmetrically so not very

416
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,120
like uh

417
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,079
tailored toward people individual people

418
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,760
so for each individual user we could

419
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,199
loop them into the process

420
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,279
so that it's more likely for them to

421
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,639
embrace the solution

422
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,279
and use their custom tool you could ask

423
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,199
users to try different joystick handles

424
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,720
and identify which one they can grip

425
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,519
best

426
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,120
ask them for their input on their button

427
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,760
sizes or where their preference would be

428
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,839
for button placement on a joystick

429
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,680
platform then we could use

430
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
digital fabrication tools like 3d

431
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,120
printers in your studio

432
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,199
that you can use to create unique

433
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,560
joystick platforms

434
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,120
that is tailored for each person so our

435
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,800
job here is to identify the correct

436
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,519
parts

437
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,160
come out come up with a diy joystick kit

438
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,920
and then come up with an easy to use

439
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,480
instruction

440
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,800
manual for assembly and modifying 3d

441
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,079
printed parts

442
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,519
for this approach the goal isn't to

443
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,759
deliver just the generic joystick model

444
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,440
but rather to teach you guys a simple

445
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,399
process

446
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,160
for reproducing low-cost unique

447
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,800
bluetooth joysticks

448
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,279
next slide

449
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,680
so switching gears a little bit another

450
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
approach that we want to explore is

451
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
a new type of joystick that senses user

452
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,600
motion that is both durable and user

453
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,399
friendly

454
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,399
the easiest way to explain this concept

455
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,160
is by looking at the wii remote

456
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,759
where you can control actions and play

457
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,399
games by waving the wii remote around

458
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,639
so with this system the goal would be to

459
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,560
control digital devices by detecting

460
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,759
motions of the user

461
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,519
that are within the natural motion of

462
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,279
the user this would be

463
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,600
a joystick in a wireless small package

464
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,720
that can be worn

465
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,560
that is attached to different parts of

466
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,720
users bodies based on their preference

467
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,360
so the three images in the below i've

468
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,680
had uh like a wireless choice they got

469
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,199
attached to my hand

470
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,480
uh my wrist and also my name next slide

471
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,240
so here's one example of how a user

472
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,000
might use this type of joystick to

473
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
replicate the four directions

474
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,079
of wheelchair movement forward backward

475
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,199
left and right

476
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,120
so here i have a motion sensor attached

477
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,800
to my wrist and i'm wearing it like a

478
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,600
watch

479
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,160
so if i were sitting in a wheelchair um

480
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
my arm and my elbow is pretty much like

481
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,120
like on table which is sort of like on a

482
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,880
armrest of a wheelchair

483
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,720
uh so in this position i'm using my

484
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,639
elbow to as a pivot point for my

485
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,519
joystick

486
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,920
so there's no longer a second physical

487
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,040
joystick device

488
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
and in this case the joystick is my arm

489
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,880
as itself

490
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,720
so intuitively if i wanted to move left

491
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,640
or right i would swing my arm

492
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,400
left or right from a neutral resting

493
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,319
position and if i wanted to go

494
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,319
forward or backwards i would similarly

495
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,839
move my arm up or down

496
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,439
next slide

497
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,520
so for more examples of this concept

498
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,359
i've uploaded uh two youtube videos that

499
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,880
are linked into the abstract that we've

500
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,160
attached

501
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,720
in this scenario i'm holding two motion

502
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,320
sensors in both of my hands and i'm

503
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,880
using

504
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,559
these sensors to control mouse and

505
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,559
keyboard commands such as

506
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,320
moving the mouse around or clicking the

507
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,480
mouse for the application of drawing and

508
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,280
paint

509
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,039
so the two images on the right are

510
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,200
drawings that are drawn only using these

511
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,280
motion sensing door sticks so i drew the

512
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,600
supply frame logo with both of my hands

513
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
and i drew the happy face by moving my

514
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,080
head to demonstrate the ability to

515
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,200
control with different body parts

516
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,320
so with that i'm going to pass it off to

517
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,520
natalia to present a different concept

518
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,000
thank you kelvin thank you ruben and

519
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,160
finally our final sec proposal is a

520
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,200
platform app

521
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,120
and obviously you might immediately ask

522
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,280
why do we talk about any apps after

523
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
these amazing contributions and ideas

524
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
are for the hardware but i'm gonna make

525
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,480
a case that

526
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,520
application and software basis uh is

527
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,640
interconnected not only for comments and

528
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,240
ruben's applications but for thousands

529
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,280
of hackers from

530
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,679
hackaday and all around the world next

531
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,520
slide please

532
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,600
so why do we even talk about software

533
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,360
well first of all it's the cheapest

534
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,280
solution for the production once

535
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,960
developed it is the easiest to

536
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,840
distribute

537
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,559
no shipping cost no 3d printing errors

538
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,919
no components may

539
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,080
stay out of stock it is potentially the

540
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,240
easiest to adapt and to test with these

541
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,360
existing devices our users own

542
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,760
as the availability of these devices is

543
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,160
possibly the highest as i are

544
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,039
ubiquitous among existing reports

545
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,480
interviews google forms

546
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,799
uh we have leveraged and collected as

547
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,600
well as feedback from the ucpla team

548
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,080
uh almost all of our users potential

549
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,520
users own a smartphone

550
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,880
a tablet or an assistive vocal

551
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,440
support system next slide

552
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,720
and obviously even going beyond with the

553
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,120
ubiquitous communications and systems

554
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,760
available

555
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,720
all around the clock even if our actual

556
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,799
users do not have a system at place

557
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,000
their caregivers

558
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,720
their homes their centers have an alexa

559
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,360
echo

560
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,600
cortana or smart home appliances that

561
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
are already connected

562
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,440
we can leverage all these devices in the

563
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,120
support of our users

564
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,678
next slide

565
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,559
here is one of the supporting codes from

566
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,640
the users and from the ucpla team

567
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,600
members

568
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,000
individual utilizes all of the above

569
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,200
smart phone

570
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,160
tablet etc as they're also consumers of

571
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,880
the times

572
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,679
but what is really lacking is the how

573
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,880
how tools

574
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,280
can they utilize these items to fit

575
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,960
their unique physicality

576
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,120
there are no other examples of these

577
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,960
either through apps or videos

578
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,360
another uh responder from our survey

579
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,440
suggests that he's like watching youtube

580
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,280
but unfortunately it's a bit hard for

581
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,039
him to actually find these videos that

582
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:17,760
actually can

583
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,640
support his condition as a condition of

584
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,840
other

585
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,679
people as him next slide

586
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,200
so what we have done already preliminary

587
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,000
we have

588
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,039
actually leveraged a first version of

589
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,000
our survey

590
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,120
where we ask very different and broad

591
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,919
questions

592
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,679
sometimes they're very precise and

593
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,039
sometimes not

594
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,720
for example if you can install any dream

595
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
app of your choice what this app would

596
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,039
be

597
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,919
what would it do or what applications

598
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:50,400
are you

599
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,280
using at least once a day like whatsapp

600
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,320
facebook or

601
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,919
instagram and based on these responses

602
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,400
our platform app can leverage a

603
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,480
suggestion for our user next slide

604
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,919
here is an example let's imagine tommy

605
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,000
tommy used our service system within an

606
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,320
app

607
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,640
or a web interface and our battery map

608
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,559
will generate a response for tommy the

609
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,320
best option would be to set up an open

610
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,960
source smart home system from openhab

611
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,120
as the smart appliances control is

612
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,559
requested by tomi

613
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,600
very often he mentions that

614
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,760
his preferred communication method is

615
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
voice and the second preferred is

616
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,720
touch tommy can either check for and our

617
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,159
platform will suggest

618
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,039
this offer from amazon echo for 39 with

619
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,720
tutorials excluded

620
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,039
or not available or this amazing

621
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,600
hackaday project from 2020 dream team

622
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,159
with a cost of 50 dollars with three

623
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,840
already available tutorials for the

624
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,200
smartphone systems

625
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,919
and maybe with other users posting the

626
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,159
tutorials on the hackaday

627
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,360
next slide there are several main

628
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,400
features

629
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,039
the versatility and personalization

630
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,600
based

631
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,480
exclusively on the desires and

632
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,919
capabilities of this current user

633
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,640
can they touch can they speak can they

634
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,200
produce

635
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,320
songs based on the existing open source

636
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,360
a commercial product

637
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,320
the user owns or wants to own if they

638
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,840
already have alexa

639
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,000
let's leverage it if they already have a

640
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
joystick let's leverage it

641
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,080
checking for tutorials and videos to

642
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,039
help the user in

643
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,320
their condition not just oh start using

644
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,159
ipad tutorial

645
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,919
learning curve could be very short to

646
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,840
non-existent depending how climatized

647
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,440
the users are with the apps and

648
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,360
because they have the devices usually

649
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,039
they are pretty acclimatized

650
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,440
and this system is extremely incremental

651
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,360
potential of easy integration with the

652
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,720
suggestions from sarah

653
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,320
alex ruben kelvin as i as well as other

654
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,559
thousands of hackers researchers and

655
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,559
designers as well as center

656
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,679
team members next slide

657
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,159
in a nutshell in a perfect scenario

658
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,320
there are actually no limitations

659
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,880
this platform can can ultimately enable

660
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,159
access

661
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,120
to any device joystick tablet wheelchair

662
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
headband to any modality

663
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,360
voice of touch it can be accommodating

664
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,600
for any budget maybe you already have it

665
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,679
or maybe you have some availabilities

666
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,200
and capabilities to pay

667
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,120
and as well as any system even the ones

668
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,360
that already purchased by the users for

669
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,240
any other needs and potentially going

670
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,039
beyond

671
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,440
a cerebral palsy accommodating other

672
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,799
disabilities at least

673
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,400
similar ones next slide

674
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,840
obviously there are a lot of challenges

675
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,159
to overcome the database should be built

676
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,679
and constantly updated

677
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,760
as it might require some support from a

678
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,520
full-time or part-time person at the

679
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,279
center at least in the beginning

680
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,320
uh but community can also leverage this

681
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,880
easily it might require obviously some

682
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
additional generation of the contact in

683
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:50,960
case of

684
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
the user that who cannot feel touch or

685
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,080
cannot speak

686
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,880
or cannot actually hear this content

687
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,240
should be generated in the mentality

688
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,919
they can hear and understand

689
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,679
obviously privacy concerns are also

690
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,200
important next slide

691
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,760
obviously here is a big and honest

692
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,919
vision of how we can see this platform

693
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,840
the best case scenario would be the

694
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,000
creation of the unified platform on

695
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,200
multiple u.s states where ucp exists

696
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,360
to include multiple centers expanding

697
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,039
into the worldwide

698
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,520
use and creating the unified database

699
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,159
with

700
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,240
great stats available in the medium case

701
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,840
we will have our counties

702
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,400
our local centers and also available for

703
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,520
statewide use

704
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,080
and in the worst case even if we have

705
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,039
one tommy

706
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,919
being able to tell me natalie researcher

707
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,000
what he's looking for and what other

708
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,600
options he's looking for i can

709
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,919
just give him a feedback hey maybe you

710
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,520
need to go on hackaday and she exists in

711
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,799
that project

712
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,720
next slide so this is obviously not

713
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,760
a final representation but a potential

714
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,480
reason that

715
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,520
tommy can control his system using like

716
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
his voice gestures or even brain he can

717
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,799
watch

718
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,799
read and listen how to acquire some

719
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,320
systems how to

720
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,159
buy them he will know that he already

721
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,919
has some parts of them for example if

722
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,000
you use his voice like alex and cortana

723
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
will explicitly tell him this

724
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,320
he can maybe participate in some paid

725
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,240
studies and he will actually be able to

726
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,120
learn about

727
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,039
his condition condition of other people

728
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,320
and connect with them

729
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,799
and finally for example the gesture

730
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,200
system is not supported yet

731
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
but a system was readily available for

732
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,039
the ucpa center who has

733
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,039
most of the components or the supply

734
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,279
frame can supply them with some

735
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,840
with a budget that is very very limited

736
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,200
he can actually address

737
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,679
to these centers to help them build the

738
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,960
system

739
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,520
and on this one and everybody can move

740
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,320
to the

741
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,159
final slide we want to thank you for

742
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,080
your attention right now we are taking

743
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,559

first off and in just a moment we'll

767
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
pass it off to them for their questions

768
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,159
and feedback i do want to remind

769
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,919

can comment any questions you might have

771
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:50,480
for

772
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,080
our panelists and team members here

773
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,240
today in the youtube comments here and

774
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,960
we'll be sure

775
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,000
to gather those before our q a for the

776
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,080
last 10 minutes of today's event

777
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
so without further ado we'll start our

778
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,760
20 minutes of discussion

779
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,679
and then we'll wrap it up with your

780
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,440
audience comments and

781
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,919
questions

782
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,799
go ahead stephanie and irania if you

783
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,279
want to take it away

784
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,159
to start out we want to thank hack day

785
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,159
and supply frame for supporting this

786
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,200
incredible challenge

787
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,760
and uh to the innovative members of our

788
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,799
dream team

789
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,240
you've brought even more than what we

790
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,720
could have imagined um

791
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,640
up to this point so this is a very

792
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,240
exciting day for us as we look through

793
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,000
all of the opportunities

794
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,679
um first of all let me just say that it

795
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,600
it is amazing to see that the spectrum

796
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,080
of solutions that you've proposed

797
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,640
really track and meet the spectrum of

798
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,520
needs

799
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,720
okay you seem to have developed

800
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,120
options and opportunities for such a

801
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,720
diverse group of people

802
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,520
and users and that's extraordinarily

803
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,240
heartening for

804
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,360
rania and i as we have met and seen so

805
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,919
many

806
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,440
um creative and very capable people

807
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,799
who simply need um greater addictivity

808
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,120
in in terms of what's available to them

809
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,320
and uh

810
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,039
i i'm quite blown away by some of the

811
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,360
suggestions already i'm very excited not

812
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,240
only to see

813
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,600
um what you've presented

814
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,080
uh reuben related to the joysticks and

815
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
and uh some of the equipment that people

816
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,399
are already most familiar with

817
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,760
but um also to really take a look at the

818
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,559
idea

819
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,799
of utilizing the motion sensors kelvin

820
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,360
so many of the individuals that we work

821
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,919
with

822
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,399
definitely have certain types of range

823
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,600
of motion

824
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,640
that they are very able to control and

825
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,360
manage

826
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,240
and are very natural to them being able

827
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,679
to leverage that

828
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,720
and be able to give them more control

829
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,880
in all sorts of activities in their

830
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,080
everyday life

831
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,520
would be significant um likewise

832
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,919
natalia it's great to look at the

833
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,000
opportunities related to the apps as

834
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,760
that's going to be such a diverse and

835
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,240
accessible platform

836
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,840
i want to start off just with a quick

837
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,600
question with regard to

838
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,320
the motion sensing equipment because

839
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,919
that's something that i know

840
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,120
even less about what's what would the

841
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,880
price point be do you still think that

842
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,000
that's going to be something

843
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,200
that might be uh able to be produced

844
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,760
in that kind of 50 range or something

845
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,559
along those lines

846
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,960
yep so um the initial prototype that i

847
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,080
was using

848
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,640
i i had like two motion sensing units

849
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,320
and also migraine controller

850
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,440
and in total it was about 30 dollars so

851
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,360
that's that's sort of the price point

852
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,720
that we're starting with so it's still

853
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,399
like similar to like the other

854
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,159
like joystick open source joystick that

855
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,840
we might want to look at the building

856
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,919
that's tremendous yeah i mean first of

857
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,600
all i think everything is like pretty

858
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,279
amazing so thank you guys

859
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,679
that was so awesome and for you to

860
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,399
consider

861
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,440
everybody like the spectrum it's you

862
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,360
know i think my wish now is like

863
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,200
i want to see it happen you know i want

864
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
to see it made you know so it's like

865
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,000
that's my excitement is knowing that

866
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
it's brought to this point now

867
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,679
i want to see like the production and

868
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,880
like have the users use it you know

869
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,640
i'm i'm also quite blown away by the

870
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,919
price point um you can get on and heard

871
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,640
our concerns about the exorbitant costs

872
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,840
of so many

873
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,880
of the devices and and the technology

874
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,240
out there that's without

875
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,600
outside of the reach of of any of us

876
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,679
let alone people who are on a very fixed

877
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,200
income um

878
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,320
and to be able to not only make

879
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,159
things um uh really inexpensive to be

880
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,320
able to obtain but to also replace

881
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,320
is is huge also to not have it caught up

882
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,519
in the um the politics and

883
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,000
and um uh challenges that come with

884
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,360
uh insurance systems and you know things

885
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,519
that have to go through uh many

886
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,279
different doctors and consultants and

887
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,640
whatnot is is huge

888
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,760
as you said democratizing the digital

889
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,240
tech and increasing the accessibility

890
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,799
um it's huge it's a huge step in terms

891
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,000
of that

892
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,159
and also just like individualizing to

893
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,159
any user that uses it you know like

894
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,760
everyone has their own language so

895
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,159
like i think that's like really powerful

896
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,679
that they could create their own

897
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,640
language

898
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,360
in in these controls and then be able to

899
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,960
use it so i think that's like really

900
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,919
important because

901
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,760
at the end of the day it's theirs you

902
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,519
know it's not ours it's

903
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,799
so yeah you guys are amazing

904
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,320
to that end the idea as well that um

905
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,559
the individuals could influence the way

906
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,440
that uh

907
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,320
their unique piece of equipment might be

908
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,840
able to be utilized uh

909
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,279
ruben as you were talking about with the

910
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,720
joystick and the different types of

911
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,919
grips

912
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,840
that's again very exciting to see

913
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,760
because the idea is to be able to

914
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
conform to the individual needs

915
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,760
and capabilities of people who have

916
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,519
you know unique uh physicality

917
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,000
each one of the platforms suggested from

918
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,320
the joysticks to the motion sensors

919
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,880
to the apps offer a range of those

920
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,240
options

921
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,120
but it's exciting too because this is

922
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,640
each one is so scalable

923
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,880
i believe um and uh

924
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,960
just as you had suggested in your design

925
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,159
goals expandable

926
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,559
um depending on the different types of

927
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,640
things that people would like to do

928
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,240
with the equipment um let's see

929
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,279
questions i probably have a million but

930
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:47,919
let me

931
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,919
drill down a bit haranya do you have

932
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,840
anything right away no i mean i

933
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,519
i don't really have any question i just

934
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,200
like i love the idea from like the

935
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,679
physicality to like the app part to like

936
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,919
how the user will use it you know and

937
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,000
that can kind of create like

938
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
a discourse amongst other users so i

939
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,600
think that's like really

940
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,279
like innovative it's not just about

941
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,720
having that uh

942
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,279
product but it's also having like the

943
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,279
apps to go with that product and then

944
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:13,919
having

945
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,080
a multiple conversation or a universal

946
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,240
conversation

947
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,519
yeah the the potential for interfacing

948
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,159
with so many

949
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,159
points of interest in people's lives is

950
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,679
huge let me ask you

951
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,240
um along the lines of the motion sensing

952
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,960
um

953
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,640
would there it would seem that there

954
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,880
might be compatibility also with

955
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,360
eye gaze technology we you know

956
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,000
definitely know

957
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,840
some folks who utilize um calibrated eye

958
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,720
gaze

959
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,600
technology to be able to control um

960
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,360
everything from

961
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,159
their wheelchairs uh to communication

962
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,120
devices

963
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
um does that seem something that would

964
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,240
be in line

965
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,120
with with what you're envisioning or

966
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,159
developing as an

967
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,159
option for motion sensing technology

968
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,799
so i believe um like the eye tracking id

969
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,080
solutions are

970
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,440
like oftentimes camera based so

971
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,960
i don't know if it's as easy to

972
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,239
integrate it might be like a separate

973
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,440
solution

974
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,918
okay not having a motion sensor like

975
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,440
attached like somewhere on the head

976
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,359
where you're like moving i think that's

977
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,639
somewhat similar if it's

978
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,119
like slight head movements to sort of

979
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,239
control

980
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,520
like different devices i can

981
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,119
jump in actually um and back it up a bit

982
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,119
because i did develop several

983
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,199
eye tracking systems that are not camera

984
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,399
based so

985
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,159
it's important to mention that there are

986
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,480
camera and non-camera based systems

987
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,800
obviously we do lose some of the

988
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,960
features so features like

989
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,839
capabilities of the system you know

990
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,159
camera based can tell you for example

991
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,000
pupil dilation and usually they're

992
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,599
extremely precise

993
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,320
but there are several drawbacks one very

994
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,960
important

995
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,520
even open source are extremely expensive

996
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,000
i haven't seen a lot like on hackaday i

997
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,839
saw couples that tried to actually nail

998
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,599
it down to cheaper versions

999
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,320
and that's why actually a lot of people

1000
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:06,800
uh

1001
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,440
still try to hack just a touch camera

1002
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,839
and

1003
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,280
i'm due to the glasses just to

1004
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,119
sunglasses to any frame like

1005
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,680
super cheap one that's one direction the

1006
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,119
thing is that obviously at night

1007
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,440
uh if the sensor is not fitting well

1008
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,560
you're tired

1009
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,720
uh the classification outcome like the

1010
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
precision would be a bit lost

1011
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,599
but we have also developed a particular

1012
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,119
focus on the privacy and ethical

1013
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,000
considerations for

1014
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,960
other users are non-camera based

1015
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,880
approaches so there will be maybe less

1016
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,480
features meaning less

1017
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,599
options but it can be like eye brings

1018
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,480
for example

1019
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,800
moving eyes left right so we can

1020
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,280
associate those potentially

1021
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,240
and these are very very affordable they

1022
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,119
do go

1023
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,920
under definitely 200 on top of my head

1024
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
and i believe that with some maybe

1025
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,680
external like research they can

1026
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,119
definitely go even

1027
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,560
cheaper obviously they cannot go like

1028
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,880
canada right away 50 but definitely

1029
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,640
i think under 200 and what is more

1030
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,720
important a lot of these

1031
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,000
systems do have imu and other sensors

1032
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,599
already built in and they weighed like

1033
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,520
20 grams something like iranian glasses

1034
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:11,920
that i

1035
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,119
i see right now i'm pretty sure it's

1036
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,359
like 20 30 grams right so that would be

1037
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,599
actually very very light yeah

1038
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,040
so there is uh options no

1039
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,680
precise i would say right away but yeah

1040
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,400
there are directions we can also explore

1041
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,640
that's that's wonderful to hear just

1042
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,720
looking at you know what what some folks

1043
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,400
have been able to really

1044
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,560
utilize and incorporate into their lives

1045
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,079
over time just to see

1046
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,920
you know different types of applications

1047
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,000
that's that's great thank you

1048
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,599
thank you very much um oh

1049
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,880
with regard to what can be 3d printed

1050
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,200
um as as probably the only person in the

1051
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,320
group who isn't

1052
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,920
um a very strong 3d printer

1053
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,079
myself can you tell us a little bit

1054
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,320
about with the

1055
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,800
motion sensing equipment as well as with

1056
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,240
the joystick

1057
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,839
what you see is being able to be easily

1058
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,440
reproduced and printed

1059
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,079
you know potentially by folks in our

1060
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,200
studios

1061
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,400
and what would be things that would need

1062
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,800
to be supplied

1063
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,720
um so for the idea of like a joystick

1064
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,240
platform where you have like a

1065
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,040
joystick and a bunch of buttons that are

1066
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,640
bluetooth connected

1067
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,880
um i think the main like ergonomic uh

1068
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,079
feature that's most important

1069
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,040
is the handle itself so i think it's the

1070
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,000
handle that we would

1071
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,560
like to have like a library of different

1072
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,520
parts

1073
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,760
that uh for different users that we want

1074
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,720
to develop

1075
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,119
and it's also like another part which is

1076
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,640
not as important but it's also like the

1077
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,520
platform

1078
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,119
and where like the buttons would go on

1079
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,800
the platform that would suit

1080
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,440
each person um so i guess those are like

1081
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:57,839
the

1082
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,920
the two uh components that we want like

1083
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,760
user input for designing the joystick

1084
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,200
platform

1085
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,839
so if there was the base um compatible

1086
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:06,800
configured

1087
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,960
equipment then you could add on those

1088
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,040
pieces and print them directly according

1089
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,839
to

1090
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,839
each individual and have them available

1091
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:14,880
okay

1092
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,920
i mean that would work uh very well with

1093
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,240
with

1094
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,800
how we're set up currently and and also

1095
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,280
to

1096
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,960
to just touch on the fact that there are

1097
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,640
so many other providers um

1098
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,280
as you mentioned across the country um

1099
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,640
many of whom that we are

1100
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,000
connected with um some are other ucps

1101
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
which is a national organization and has

1102
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,160
affiliates across the country but also

1103
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,760
um providers of other independent

1104
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,119
nonprofits that we know need

1105
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,960
this kind of technology and would enjoy

1106
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,320
being able to

1107
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,440
um to experiment with some of these

1108
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
prototypes and be able to give feedback

1109
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,680
so um there's a huge number of people

1110
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,599
out there and then way beyond even our

1111
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,400
own network

1112
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,280
i'm sure that this could uh benefit so

1113
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,839
thank you

1114
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,440
aranya do you have anything else uh yeah

1115
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,040
i mean i think the idea of all the

1116
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,560
different joysticks are like

1117
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,400
again that's very personal and that's

1118
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,160
very individualized because

1119
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,320
every joystick that's out there you know

1120
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,839
you just got that one basic one

1121
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,599
but some of them use like their like

1122
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,040
wrist to kind of move

1123
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,960
the joystick around so that big one was

1124
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,400
like really cool

1125
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,440
so i mean you know basically you guys

1126
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,079
thought about

1127
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,079
everyone's physicality and kind of like

1128
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,440
the spectrum and then

1129
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,839
kind of adapt all these different like

1130
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:32,880
you know

1131
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,359
set of things that go to everyone so i

1132
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,160
think that's

1133
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,880
like really interesting so yeah that's

1134
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,119
awesome

1135
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,440
it's also interesting i would just um

1136
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,880
just a little bit more feedback the

1137
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,640
notion that you've got these different

1138
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,599
platforms offers a user who has

1139
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,920
different capacities to use them based

1140
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,680
on how they're feeling we talked a bit

1141
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,920
about in some of our conversations about

1142
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,720
um

1143
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,040
you know just the fact that uh exerting

1144
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,720
a lot of physical motion

1145
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,960
can be very tiresome and so at the end

1146
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,000
of the day

1147
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,839
the physicality might decline but

1148
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,280
somebody might be able to

1149
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,599
rely on blinking as you were saying

1150
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,800
natalia or

1151
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,480
or just making sounds to control

1152
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,920
something so again having these

1153
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,119
multi-faceted

1154
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,440
options and solutions uh we're just

1155
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,640
we're just kind of like

1156
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,480
time you know how the kind of the body

1157
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,800
kind of like not deteriorates but just

1158
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,200
kind of loses some of the functionality

1159
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,520
and so these are the different options

1160
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,880
as time

1161
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,319
you know takes over then they can again

1162
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,560
they're not losing their ability they

1163
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,440
just need more

1164
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,839
adaptation and some of these things will

1165
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,040
like fit into that

1166
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,240
adaptation absolutely and

1167
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,440
one of the things i wanted to to

1168
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,720
mention correct me if i'm wrong team

1169
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,520
we're still waiting for results of the

1170
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,359
survey stride and based on those

1171
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,640
findings

1172
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,920
the project might go in one direction or

1173
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,119
the other

1174
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,000
and we had so just to give super quick

1175
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,119
our update because

1176
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,040
folks from the outside on youtube

1177
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,400
obviously do not know but i tried to

1178
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,680
mention it real brief

1179
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,000
we rolled out a first version of the

1180
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,599
survey and the actual very quick

1181
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,359
feedback that we got

1182
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,920
as i said we work like 60 plus questions

1183
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,560
very very very long and

1184
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,720
full one and the very first feedback we

1185
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,160
got from stephanie and iran is super

1186
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,920
useful saying that hey you know

1187
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
it's amazing but we don't work only with

1188
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,200
cerebral palsy like

1189
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,280
it's exactly your last point stephanie

1190
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,400
and irania

1191
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,720
there are other similar and sometimes

1192
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,240
not similar to all disabilities and

1193
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,040
conditions

1194
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,800
is exactly what we are talking about so

1195
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,480
ultimately we might

1196
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,599
even expand it our survey changing a bit

1197
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,359
the language and adapting it actually

1198
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,480
more generic disability uh so some links

1199
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,319
were provided for the app's eye to

1200
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,319
include a generic disability and not

1201
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,280
only cp

1202
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,359
but it's an excellent point for from you

1203
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,280
stefan and irania saying that

1204
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,480
uh with time even us we are not as fresh

1205
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,040
at 9 00 a.m as like for example at

1206
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,760
7 00 a.m or 7 p.m et cetera and

1207
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,640
obviously

1208
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,079
there are disabilities and conditions

1209
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,000
where it is unfortunately

1210
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,800
degenerative deterioration like ls and

1211
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,240
there are no way back no

1212
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,960
come back so definitely if you can also

1213
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,440
meet

1214
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,960
these users potentially halfway

1215
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,319
uh we're not saying that we're gonna

1216
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,760
design everything in two months but

1217
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,000
definitely this is a big big vision and

1218
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,800
direction

1219
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,000
which we'll try to shoot for at least

1220
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,280
with the help of the fox and the team

1221
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,079
well and again um the the incredible

1222
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,400
advocacy to be able to empower people to

1223
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,440
be independent

1224
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,880
in every aspect um any aspect really of

1225
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,960
their choosing their lives is

1226
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,520
is significant with this project thank

1227
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,960
you for taking that on

1228
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,560
um thank you on behalf of our

1229
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,000
organization and

1230
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,400
um i believe so many out there so many

1231
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,599
others out there who

1232
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,319
who are absolutely yearning to be able

1233
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,760
to

1234
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,680
leverage their their great knowledge

1235
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,680
their capability their ideas

1236
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,119
their voice in different ways um this is

1237
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,280
this is tremendous

1238
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,599
i'm sorry i'm gonna have to cut up uh

1239
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:10,960
cut off

1240
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,079
our discussion there and turn to our

1241
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,079
questions from the audience we have some

1242
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,319
amazing questions coming in so i want to

1243
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,880
make sure we allow for enough time

1244
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,280
to answer those thank you stephanie and

1245
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,880
ronya for your feedback and

1246
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,440
insight and i'm excited to see what our

1247
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,520
team has to say to some of these

1248
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,720
comments so let's get started here and i

1249
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,920
will ask

1250
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,359
to the dream team members if you could

1251
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,079
try to be as concise with your answers

1252
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:40,480
here

1253
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,760
maybe leave it up to one one member to

1254
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,960
answer each

1255
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,640
question just so we can get through them

1256
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,240
we have about

1257
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,240
six collected here and there might be

1258
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,760
more coming in so i want to get to as

1259
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,800
many as possible

1260
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,200
in the remaining time we have all right

1261
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,000
so

1262
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,160
first question are there any plans to

1263
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,839
integrate haptic feedback to the

1264
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,200
wireless joysticks

1265
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,400
um so yeah i think before we get into

1266
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,160
that i think the first question that we

1267
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,720
asked the ucple was um can they sense

1268
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,359
touch

1269
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,720
um because that that's probably more

1270
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,160
important if they can't sense it then

1271
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,440
there's no point so

1272
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,839
i think uh irania you mentioned that

1273
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,440
they they do and for

1274
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,359
uh each person that that sense of touch

1275
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,480
is either heightened or

1276
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,960
compromised so it varies case by case um

1277
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,000
so with that

1278
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,560
suggestion um we do hope to i'll play

1279
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,160
around with uh

1280
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,480
like providing some haptic feedback

1281
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,760
along with like some vision if they

1282
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,280
don't have like visual feedback or any

1283
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,079
other

1284
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,839
feedback sensations so yes

1285
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,880
thank you kelvin another question was

1286
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,800
how do you avoid the training bias that

1287
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,880
is inherent in these voice assistants

1288
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,640
do you have plans on making your own

1289
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,880
voice assistant for this application

1290
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,880
trained specifically from these users

1291
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,440
and so uh once again we will definitely

1292
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,480
validate some things

1293
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,720
in offline with stephanie and irania

1294
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,480
first thing we need to

1295
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,079
actually think about privacy as i

1296
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,280
mentioned it's very important for

1297
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,280
everyone and caregivers included feeling

1298
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,160
comfortable

1299
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,920
so there might be a way to go around

1300
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,440
this second thing

1301
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,079
uh some of the assistants and we talked

1302
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:16,800
to the

1303
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,000
members of lexi team and others

1304
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
for the accessibility have a actually

1305
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,880
available set of accessibility features

1306
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,280
that are that need to be activated and

1307
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,119
validated but they're already

1308
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,839
available so that's also an option and

1309
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:32,240
we

1310
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,560
saw that we might work in this direction

1311
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,440
uh with some

1312
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,880
additional feedback from stephanie and

1313
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,359
iranian about voice and service that we

1314
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,920
are collecting

1315
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,520
thank you natalia um next question

1316
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,319
was there any consideration given to eeg

1317
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,240
monitor headsets and leveraging those

1318
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,119
with software

1319
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,839
for example muse by interaxicon would

1320
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,319
that work

1321
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,680
yeah totally as actually phd in brand

1322
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,839
computer interfaces here

1323
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,520
and definitely actually posted two logs

1324
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,440
uh on our hackaday web page don't

1325
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,560
hesitate to

1326
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,040
check it actually talking about using

1327
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,400
eeg headsets

1328
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,119
as a part of my prior work with ls

1329
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,079
patients

1330
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,480
and we definitely considered this in our

1331
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,839
preliminary surveillance have two

1332
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,920
responses people mentioned that they use

1333
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,960
eeg

1334
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,520
so we don't think that it might be the

1335
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,480
thing we will go

1336
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,040
for but there is always a lot of prior

1337
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,119
work and one of the projects i worked is

1338
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,400
on open source and potentially we can

1339
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,760
embed it in our app

1340
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,960
and system so definitely not excluded uh

1341
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,880
check out the logs definitely

1342
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,599
awesome thank you um another question

1343
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,880
and maybe this would just

1344
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,839
need a little more clarification or dive

1345
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,680
a little deeper because i do believe you

1346
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,200
started to cover it in one of your

1347
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,280
slides but this person also may have

1348
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,400
joined a little later

1349
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,839
how do you plan on connecting the

1350
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,000
universal remote to a wide range of

1351
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,960
products

1352
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,760
maybe you could elaborate on that point

1353
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,319
true thing

1354
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,920
it kind of goes back to our first

1355
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,000
overview slide between the the

1356
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,079
physical world and the digital world the

1357
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,319
thought was the universal remote would

1358
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,440
have an onboard wireless system low

1359
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:17,920
power

1360
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,440
similar to like z-wave there's a lot of

1361
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,520
popular smart home systems

1362
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,800
and then it would communicate with a

1363
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,640
smart hub or a smart home system and

1364
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,319
then be able to digitize

1365
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,960
or connect digitally to the rest of the

1366
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,440
different

1367
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,640
items in the world

1368
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,640
thanks ruben have you considered

1369
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,960
developing a standard base that hackers

1370
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,960
could then design their own 3d printed

1371
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,559
parts that could attach to the base

1372
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,319
i think that falls along kelvin's idea

1373
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,800
essentially the joystick method where

1374
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,480
yeah you would start with a base

1375
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,079
set of buttons and joysticks and then

1376
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,040
you could build off over there

1377
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,800
thank you kelvin did you want to add

1378
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,440
anything to that

1379
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,599
no problem all right we'll keep going

1380
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,800
it seems uh like any technology such as

1381
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,800
eye or motion tracking there needs to be

1382
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,000
an option for an on

1383
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,160
off so that users can still have the

1384
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,720
option to move without

1385
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,920
something moving so i guess that's more

1386
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,480
of a

1387
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,319
commoner suggestion but if you guys

1388
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,000
would like to

1389
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,680
elaborate on if you've considered that

1390
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,440
or how you would differentiate maybe

1391
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,440
in the different applications of any of

1392
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,720
these solutions whether it be the

1393
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,720
universal remote the joystick

1394
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,839
the app utilizing other devices etc how

1395
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:44,280
do you

1396
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,400
differentiate the functions and

1397
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,520
applications

1398
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,200
being as we're still in the very

1399
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,359
preliminary design

1400
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,839
we are sure considering a lot of options

1401
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,240
there's so many other different options

1402
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,160
to go off of what kelvin was showing

1403
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,920
with the joint with the wireless choice

1404
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,359
the imus there was a project where

1405
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,520
someone commented these dots you just

1406
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,559
place on your skin

1407
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,800
and then some device tracks them for for

1408
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,720
amputees there's so many cool projects

1409
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,599
out there

1410
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,440
and so we haven't nailed down on what

1411
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,960
exactly we're going to focus on

1412
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,880
so keep the comments coming we'll be

1413
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,760
sure to include them in our design

1414
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,599
yeah yeah so to just add up on that so

1415
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,599
like um we could also have like a

1416
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,520
joystick let's see like a button

1417
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,920
so maybe your like foot is in a certain

1418
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,520
position so by slightly altering your

1419
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,079
slit

1420
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,920
or like by lifting up your arm off your

1421
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,839
armrest that that sort of like is your

1422
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:32,079
on

1423
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,720
off that is sort of intuitive to use

1424
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,520
awesome thank you reuben and calvin uh

1425
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,359
one um one audience member wanted to

1426
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:46,880
highlight to check out

1427
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,800
iwriter for another awesome open source

1428
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,720
eye tracker they use it with an artist

1429
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,800
to project graffiti they drew onto a

1430
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,119
building because they couldn't draw

1431
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,160
so i love that suggestion

1432
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,200
another question we had was

1433
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,599
how are you all designing the survey so

1434
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,400
that it's accessible

1435
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,839
they're suggesting that maybe some

1436
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,160
community members might not be able to

1437
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,480
fill out the survey so that's a question

1438
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,359
totally

1439
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,520
yeah we thought about this that's why so

1440
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,559
we needed

1441
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,240
as you all guys know and for those

1442
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,000
youtube who are watching do not really

1443
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,480
know

1444
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,079
it is two months sprint so we are trying

1445
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,359
to cover

1446
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:26,960
all the tracks and to right now actually

1447
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,720
make one more accessibility version

1448
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,680
available

1449
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,480
definitely right now limited and we are

1450
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,000
working in this direction

1451
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,359
uh but certainly if we will make it um

1452
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,520
for the extended period of time august

1453
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,960
and even beyond august

1454
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,280
we're definitely gonna roll out at least

1455
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,359
one more accessibility version

1456
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,200
for sure to build off of that

1457
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
we understand that many users at this

1458
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,280
point before they have the tools in hand

1459
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:53,760
will need

1460
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,119
their caregivers to help fill out

1461
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,800
surveys and get us information and

1462
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,760
feedback

1463
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,920
and we're relying a lot on the ucpla

1464
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,960
team to help us with that

1465
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,839
thank you all right and then last

1466
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,079
question

1467
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,280
was around the privacy again

1468
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,359
with voice assistance how do you ensure

1469
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,319
that privacy

1470
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,839
is remained intact if you're

1471
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,839
intending to integrate these other

1472
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:22,000
devices

1473
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,520
yes for sure so once again uh

1474
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,760
we didn't confirm yet uh will we go with

1475
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,440
voice assistant or not that's one of the

1476
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,880
suggestions basically

1477
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,000
uh built upon the feedback from ucpla

1478
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,040
and also this survey uh preliminary

1479
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,720
results only on 10

1480
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,680
users so far actually indicated that all

1481
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,000
of them can use voice and

1482
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,640
uh it heavy in amazon aircraft on this

1483
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,720
kind of system so once again

1484
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,760
we will see how we can if we leverage

1485
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,280
this um communication uh how secure

1486
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,119
it is and obviously in everything that

1487
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,960
we are designing and looking at

1488
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,200
uh privacy and what will be collected as

1489
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,040
data would be the first thing

1490
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,440
and we definitely were thinking actually

1491
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,400
so we need

1492
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,280
proof of concept not to using voice

1493
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,800
assistance that is off the shelf

1494
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
commercial available but have a

1495
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,040
small proof of concept version to being

1496
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,359
tested by our users and their caregivers

1497
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,079
securely

1498
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,480
in full comfort and without actually

1499
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,920
going into depth but

1500
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,920
showing if this proof of concept even

1501
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,440
works so

1502
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,079
yeah thank you thank you natalia

1503
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,720
so that about is uh gonna wrap it up for

1504
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,960
us today we're about time here i want to

1505
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,720
give a huge thank you to our awesome

1506
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,559
audience members for those wonderful

1507
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:39,280
questions

1508
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,920
and to our dream team participants of

1509
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,400
course

1510
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,559
natalia rubin and calvin for their

1511
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,559
incredible proposals that they presented

1512
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:47,359
today

1513
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,839
and last but not least our wonderful

1514
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,720
mentors and advisors from ucpla

1515
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,960
aranya and stephanie thank you for your

1516
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,720
generous contributions and your time

1517
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,480
that you've continued to give us for the

1518
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,319
prize and for the dream teams

1519
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,000
we're really excited to see how these

1520
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,079
