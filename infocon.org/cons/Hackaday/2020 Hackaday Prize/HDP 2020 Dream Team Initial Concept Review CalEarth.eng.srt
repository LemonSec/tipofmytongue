89
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,440
call

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,840
earth dream team challenge the team

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,200
includes samira

92
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,799
she's based in barcelona spain alex

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,080
in southern california and jason in

94
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,200
france so hi guys it is great to see you

95
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,159
here

96
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,560
the color challenge asks the team to

97
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,840
automate or

98
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,560
mechanize parts of the building process

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
in order to maximize

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
efficiency without compromising the

101
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,879
integrity

102
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,439
of color's vision to ensure

103
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,799
accessibility

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,760
and affordability of their home building

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
technology

106
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,439
so as you can see just like with the

107
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,879
other challenges there is more than it

108
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,920
meets the eye

109
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
there are some fundamental questions

110
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
that our team has to ask

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,360
regarding procedures systems etc

112
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,760
together with the research they have

113
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,640
interviewed

114
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,120
a lot of people and gained very

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,720
interesting insights

116
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,759

133
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,680
the past three weeks

134
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,400
um our main mission is to increase the

135
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,639
demand for sustainable construction

136
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,720
in order to reduce the carbon footprint

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,560
of the world and to make uh better

138
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,520
construction

139
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,039
materials possible and for that we were

140
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,160
we're working with keller and um using

141
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,479
the super adobe technique our aim is to

142
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,560
make this a huge trend in the united

143
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,240
states and europe

144
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
enabling that to uh be accessible in

145
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,639
developing countries

146
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
salads does have a lot of different

147
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,360
target groups there is a rapid refugee

148
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,039
constructions in which the houses can be

149
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,960
built in a day or less

150
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,680
and then there's low income or uh

151
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,400
housing for

152
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
communities which less resources and

153
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,120
then definitely there is premium and

154
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,919
first world

155
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,120
um housing and in this challenge we are

156
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,680
targeting the premium first world um

157
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,840
housing and the reason for that as i

158
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,880
mentioned is

159
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,639
um in order to make the trend in the

160
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,400
united states currently there's a huge

161
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,199
trend for

162
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,479
um tiny houses sustainable houses and

163
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,160
self-filled for young homeowners

164
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,000
who do not want to have a mortgage who

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,600
want to be independent

166
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,160
and build their own house and have very

167
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,000
tech-centered solutions

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,639
so we are targeting this um so a lot of

169
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,039
americans and europeans out there

170
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,400
do have um colored housing as a solution

171
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,960
for their own housing

172
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,600
and um our intention with that is to

173
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,840
reduce the labor

174
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,960
work and also to provide some

175
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,280
low-to-high-tech

176
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,560
solutions in enabling that and

177
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,960
uh for this uh in the past three weeks

178
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
we've uh interviewed a lot of people

179
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
who are representatives of gallard in

180
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,599
europe and their couple who building

181
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,800
uh their own house in the us uh

182
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,160
architects from afghanistan to a airbnb

183
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,880
host who built gathered houses in mexico

184
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
we've had a lot of feedback from them

185
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,599
they've learned from their experiences

186
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,919
and from the collective learning of all

187
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,720
of um

188
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,680
those interactions we have um narrowed

189
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,080
down

190
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,479
few pain points which have been um

191
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,840
repetitive

192
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,960
uh in this style of construction which

193
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,680
is the work

194
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,360
is labor intensive there is

195
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,880
a bottleneck in the compass

196
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,639
profile uh end of the house itself

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,520
which means where the next bag arrives

198
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,199
in the construction for the layering of

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,840
it

200
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,319
the mechanism to fill the earth into the

201
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,599
bags itself

202
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,160
ability to mix soil because site and

203
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,560
earth is different in each location

204
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,800
and also plastering of the material on

205
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,240
the houses

206
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,000
and organic bags versus plastic bags

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,440
and how does one move material

208
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
vertically as the house gets

209
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,639
taller and taller and safety overall

210
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,479
safety in the construction site

211
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,120
all of these have been uh repetitive

212
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,199
pain points that were addressed

213
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,919
um and we as a team decided to

214
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,919
um research furthermore on two of the

215
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,560
aspects

216
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,800
and we will be discussing those today

217
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,680
first of that

218
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
is the compass and second is mechanism

219
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
to be able to fill the bags

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,279
at different levels of the construction

221
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,838
and now jason will continue

222
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,720
uh hey so um the pain point i'm going to

223
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,600
speak about is

224
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,800
a mechanism for filling the adobe bags

225
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,200
so for those of you who don't know the

226
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,320
structures are made

227
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,360
by filling a long sausage-like bag with

228
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,279
earth the bags are known as super adobe

229
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:57,920
bags

230
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,240
um the bags then layered on top of each

231
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,839
other support itself

232
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,080
to create a self-supporting dome or an

233
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,760
arch structure

234
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
the process is done entirely by hand and

235
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,080
it requires a minimum of two people

236
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,760
and at least one of the two people needs

237
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,600
a medium to high skill level to be able

238
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,680
to do this

239
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,439
i could have the next slide please

240
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,360
um so we we identified the specific

241
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,560
bottleneck was was filling uh the back

242
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
so like the bags are held

243
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
held open manually by one person and

244
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,600
then the second person

245
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,519
loads small buckets of earth into the

246
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,240
bag this process is repeated hundreds of

247
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,000
times for each layer and then

248
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,680
stays the same from the bottom to the

249
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,440
top which means that these tasks have to

250
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,480
be performed

251
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,519
at ground level and also at height

252
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,880
i could have the next slide

253
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,200
uh so the first solution we came up with

254
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,399
uh is a mechanism

255
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,440
for holding the bags open um it's like a

256
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
handheld tool

257
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,959
uh and it allows you to funnel earth in

258
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,360
into the super adobe bags

259
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,279
um so you'd have the capacity to

260
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
pre-load an entire layers

261
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,000
worth of uh super adobe bag onto the

262
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,720
tool

263
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,360
and then back as in and it can be held

264
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,399
in one hand

265
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,560
we have a short video which then so it

266
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,079
works like a christmas tree netting

267
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:16,640
machine

268
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
for those of you who aren't familiar we

269
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,320
have a video which uh explains how this

270
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,720
works

271
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,320
so the bags would be loaded onto the

272
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,399
tube and that had to be funneled inside

273
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,959
like so

274
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
and then you could just repeat this

275
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,920
process all the way around to create one

276
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,240
layer

277
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
and we'd estimate this would cost just

278
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
under a hundred dollars

279
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
all right clay have the next slide

280
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,480
please i said the second

281
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,079
development of this which is a slightly

282
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,760
more high-tech version the previous

283
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,640
version is

284
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,560
no tech no electrical parts or anything

285
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,240
this version is slightly more

286
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,600
high-tech um and it's mechanizing

287
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,079
the same system so you used to have the

288
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,160
funnel which you could pre-load the bag

289
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,120
onto

290
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,920
uh yeah that's perfect i say you still

291
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,959
have the uh

292
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,560
you still have the uh tube mechanism um

293
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,480
and the netting mechanism for loading

294
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,600
the bag onto

295
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
but this time the earth would be

296
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,800
automatically fed in

297
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,079
into the tube um so the main difference

298
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,800
is this load is loaded from above

299
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,160
and you could also use it to mix the s

300
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,640
so this

301
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,040
uh this addresses the additional problem

302
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,839
of

303
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,760
of mixing the earth and regulating the

304
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
humidity level of the soil by

305
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,480
consistently loading equal buckets of

306
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,680
ass and water into the helper

307
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,839
and this would be roughly 350 at 400

308
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:57,120
to produce that's all

309
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,720
so i'd like to hand over to alex

310
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,120
uh your microphone is muted alex

311
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,079
and i'm back sorry about that so one

312
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,680
additional interesting pain point

313
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,560
that we found while you know

314
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
interviewing

315
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,399
both calirth and end users who had built

316
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,279
these structures

317
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,639
is that a surprising bottleneck in the

318
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,720
construction process is actually the

319
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,000
compass mechanism itself used to map

320
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,320
out exactly where bags get laid so under

321
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,480
normal circumstances in the most

322
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,160
basic low-tech construction methodology

323
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,040
a system of ropes or chains is used to

324
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,000
trigonometrically

325
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,800
identify uh where the next layer is

326
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,079
supposed to be positioned so that the

327
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,519
bag doesn't overhang too much or

328
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,639
overhang too little

329
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,320
and as you build up the structure the

330
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,880
proper mathematical profile is followed

331
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,000
so advantageously you know chains and

332
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,200
ropes are relatively easy to come by

333
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,720
disadvantageously this actually requires

334
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,120
a fair amount of sort of mental energy

335
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,760
to

336
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,839
operate which you know obviously over

337
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,200
the course of a long day of construction

338
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,279
can certainly get in short supply

339
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,200
and it works out to be the case that

340
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
usually there's one person handling this

341
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,000
task

342
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,160
and especially in cases where there are

343
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,440
lots of other builders doing the more

344
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,959
manual labor

345
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,880
that one person's mind share can sort of

346
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,560
become a bottleneck where other

347
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,160
crew members are waiting on that person

348
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,240
to calculate out and and position the

349
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,839
next bag and that's a

350
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,360
sort of thing and the other issue

351
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
uh that we identified as it turns out

352
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,399
this is somewhat prone to

353
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,639
integrated errors so for instance if a

354
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,320
chain gets wrapped up around one of the

355
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
posts and therefore shortened

356
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,600
or if you know a slight miscalculation

357
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,720
is made that sort of thing

358
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,440
it can cause a cumulative error where an

359
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,760
entire layer or two layers

360
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,959
need to get removed and replaced

361
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,000
uh in order to correct a mistake and

362
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,760
that obviously takes a whole lot more

363
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,240
time

364
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,160
itself so we've come up with a couple of

365
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,839
potential uh

366
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,079
solutions to this problem and in fact

367
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,920
cal earth has one solution of their own

368
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,320
so next slide

369
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,079
the solution that cal earth has has come

370
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,360
up with to

371
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,680
fix this in certain constructions is

372
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,480
what they call

373
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,279
uh the sail methodology so effectively

374
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,560
it's a big

375
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,040
metal or wooden um i think based on size

376
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,320
typically metal

377
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,720
structure that effectively creates a

378
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,440
template

379
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,800
of the dome's cross section and this

380
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,959
in particular works best with domes uh

381
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,199
rather than vaults but the idea is

382
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,560
this sail you can sort of tell why it's

383
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,440
named that

384
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
gets rotated around the center axis of

385
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,480
the dome and

386
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,079
it becomes very obvious where to place

387
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,079
the next layer of bags based on

388
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,000
you know proximity to that sort of outer

389
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,079
curved profile

390
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,639
one potential issue with this is that

391
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,639
it's entirely dome specific so it only

392
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,440
applies to

393
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,680
one geometry and in fact one particular

394
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,959
size of construction

395
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,920
so it's not quite as versatile as the

396
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,959
compass for instance

397
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,040
which you know one chain and you can

398
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,279
calculate any dome that you like

399
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,199
another issue is that there are often

400
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,639
some obstructions

401
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,560
uh in the path of the wall as it gets

402
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,079
built up for instance

403
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,079
wooden forms to place windows or

404
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,480
ventilation or anything of that sort

405
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
that penetrates through the wall of the

406
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,680
dome as it's getting built

407
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,920
might protrude and in many cases

408
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,760
necessarily protrudes quite far

409
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,680
into the inner volume of the dome such

410
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,199
that as you were to try to

411
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,480
rotate this sail through the 360 degrees

412
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,000
inside that structure

413
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
it would run into these obstructions and

414
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,440
in certain cases

415
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,600
that means that the sail could only

416
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
possibly rotate through some limited

417
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,079
subset of the overall profile and that

418
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,000
doesn't quite work out

419
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,959
um we've identified one potentially

420
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,639
high-tech solution to solve this problem

421
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,959
which is next slide please

422
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,199
we call this the lidar compass so this

423
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,120
is effectively the medium or high-tech

424
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,639
version

425
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,160
of our solution and the idea here is

426
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,279
um use a lidar to effectively

427
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,440
profile a cross-section of the dome as

428
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,320
it's uh

429
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
getting built live and for those

430
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,920
unfamiliar with how lidar works

431
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,120
effectively

432
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,480
a laser tape measure spins in a circle

433
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,079
and measures the distance from the

434
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,120
center of that

435
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,480
to the thing that it sees in its way

436
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,839
in a continuous sweep so for instance if

437
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,920
this laser is positioned in the center

438
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,959
of the dome

439
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,040
on the ground it would measure the

440
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,880
radius of the dome to the lower

441
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,560
you know lower immediate wall um

442
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,240
we pair this lidar with a second laser a

443
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,720
visual laser a visible laser

444
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,240
and ideally two colors but not

445
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,839
necessarily

446
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,199
and create an integrated tool for

447
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,800
effectively profiling the inside of the

448
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,240
dome the same way the sail works

449
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
so the idea here is you load a digital

450
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,560
profile of the dome

451
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,800
so a 2d cross section of the dome into

452
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,759
the device

453
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,920
and it knows at any given angle of

454
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,959
elevation

455
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,759
where the bag should be placed for that

456
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,639
measurement

457
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,800
and in cases where as we see in the

458
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,399
green lines in this little illustration

459
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,759
in cases where the bags are placed

460
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,559
correctly

461
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,640
the lidar measures the distance to those

462
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,079
bags as being within appropriate

463
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,640
tolerance

464
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,599
and it paints a green visible laser line

465
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,880
onto those bags

466
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,079
so that you see that those are placed

467
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,760
correctly and in situations where the

468
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,079
bag is placed incorrectly

469
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,640
it would paint a red laser line or for

470
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
instance in a one color version which is

471
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
quite a bit easier to produce it would

472
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,720
simply paint a line where the bag is

473
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,199
correct

474
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,120
and no line where the bag is incorrect

475
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,200
the idea of this is

476
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,520
as you're placing the next next bag

477
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,640
layer

478
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,080
one the layer that already exists

479
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,679
assuming it's correctly placed should be

480
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,200
painted with a green line

481
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
um or a line of some kind and then

482
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,720
you'll know it's in the correct spot and

483
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,000
as you're laying the next bag

484
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,480
you can simply place your hand in the

485
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,440
path of the

486
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,000
of the slice and if it gets lit up green

487
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,960
you know that your hand is in the

488
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,400
correct position and that's where you

489
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,679
should be laying the bag

490
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,080
so it's effectively a light version of

491
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,679
that same sail technique but with the

492
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,640
advantage that

493
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,600
as you rotate this device through a 360

494
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,799
degree circle

495
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,480
there's nothing to get in the way of it

496
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,880
um and this has a sort of secondary

497
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,840
advantage

498
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,120
that it's just kind of cool and

499
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,360
futuristic and sort of you know cutting

500
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,840
edge technology so it sort of makes the

501
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,760
the overall construction process feel

502
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
like a little bit neat and modern

503
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,240
um in a way that our our target audience

504
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,919
may well uh kind of jive with

505
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,440
and obviously it's only an option so you

506
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,200
don't have to if you uh

507
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,320
if you don't like that um certainly the

508
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,919
primary concern here is that this seems

509
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:32,799
quite expensive

510
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,840
in fact the enabling feature of this

511
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,559
technology is that uh the cheapest

512
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,600
possible

513
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
two-dimensional lidars have actually

514
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,039
gotten quite quite cheap

515
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,640
so the device at the core of this thing

516
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
is an off-the-shelf product that retails

517
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,080
for around 100

518
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,679
which means we expect the overall bill

519
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,360
of materials budget for such a tool

520
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,000
as this would certainly fall under that

521
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,960
350

522
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,400
price point making it attainable for

523
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,880
even a single build or

524
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,799
you know could fall into a number of

525
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,640
other business models for cal earth

526
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,919
um that said we also have a

527
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,679
slight improvement on the sale technique

528
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,840
that makes it a little bit more

529
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
versatile

530
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,240
thank you alex for uh sharing that um

531
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,320
as alex said yeah this is somewhat

532
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,400
similar to the system that khaled

533
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,280
already has

534
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,240
it does um stand at the center of the

535
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,720
site

536
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,760
the construction site uh having the pole

537
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,880
uh fixed at the radius of the turn

538
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,520
and this horizontal member being the one

539
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,640
that indicates

540
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
where at what distance should be the

541
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,320
next bag arriving

542
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,760
and the idea is this point of junction

543
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,600
is a very interesting clamp that's

544
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,799
custom made

545
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,400
and that's something that you could

546
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,240
press fit and release

547
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,360
in order to move the member upwards

548
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,480
vertically

549
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,360
and also enable it to rotate and it

550
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,120
doesn't have that profile

551
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,280
which was initially obstructing the

552
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,880
different um

553
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,679
windows spaces and other elements that

554
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,360
were present on site

555
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,960
and this one member is um

556
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,600
something that we are intending to be

557
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,360
used on the site and here you can see

558
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,280
some of the prototypes that we have made

559
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,440
here we've used some traditional

560
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,640
pvc uh pipe joints that are available in

561
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,039
the market to just prototype this

562
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,640
here we've used bamboo so we reduced the

563
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,880
plastic using the prototyping phase but

564
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,159
ideally we want to use

565
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,280
pvc for the construction site

566
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,320
the reason being that a home builder can

567
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,400
use the pvc pipe initially

568
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,960
and later use that in their own plumbing

569
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,080
of the toilets

570
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,760
so the use of the pipes in the

571
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,679
construction phase doesn't uh create

572
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,520
larger carbon footprint

573
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,559
and this one is just um it rotates

574
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,240
on the axis where it is attached

575
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,480
and the builders have the flexibility to

576
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,200
move it to the point where they have to

577
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,960
measure the

578
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,400
next bag location and post that we are

579
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,120
prototyping some press fit custom

580
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,080
let's say jointry details which enable

581
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,720
us

582
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,200
and ideally what would be happening is

583
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,720
uh when our custom

584
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,400
mold is made that the horizontal number

585
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,679
could be slide

586
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,159
both ways so you can have a different

587
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:26,720
length

588
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,480
as the construction starts you have a

589
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,799
much longer horizontal member

590
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,240
and you can push it inwards inwards

591
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,400
inwards as it goes so just with two

592
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,080
members you're able to do the

593
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,640
whole um side measurement and it's um

594
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
very easy

595
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
and you can see when the scale of the

596
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,760
product in the in the background as well

597
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,200
so uh that uh said that's one of the low

598
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,679
cost

599
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,120
um solutions this is a basic timeline

600
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,520
for the project and we're here right now

601
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,600
presenting to you and sharing what um

602
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,760
research we've done till date and later

603
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,000
we will be conceptualizing topics that

604
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,080
interested the non-profit today

605
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,919
and leading them to more prototyping

606
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,240
phase and henceforth

607
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,360
and uh something that the ambition

608
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,000
caller

609
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,880
um to get out of this research from us

610
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,760
is to have an

611
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,000
amazon or a self store that they have

612
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,440
like on their website

613
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
where they do provide solutions to

614
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,159
people we want to add more elements to

615
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:24,559
their

616
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,679
um store by giving them

617
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,760
press fit joint which enables people to

618
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,600
make a custom compass

619
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,240
and the leader which is either rent or

620
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,799
buy

621
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,120
and as with the extruder they can rent

622
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
or buy and

623
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,559
they can be sent to the site and

624
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,799
returned so multiple homeowners can use

625
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,520
these

626
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,919
uh high to medium tech technologies to

627
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:46,720
enable them

628
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,360
uh build uh their houses and this is

629
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
something that also can add as a revenue

630
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,280
stream for calories along with the other

631
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,280
products that they have on the store

632
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,960
so um now we would like to

633
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,200
know if you have any questions and

634
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,159
interact with

635
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,400
colors and as well as the audience thank

636
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,240
you so much for your patience and i will

637
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,200
hand it out to magenta for the next step

638
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,600
thank you

639
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,960
thank you so much samira jason and alex

640
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,880
for that awesome presentation i'm really

641
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,360
excited to hear what the cal earth team

642
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,520
thinks and has as far as questions and

643
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
of course want to remind our audience to

644
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,039
comment any questions below

645
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,720
we'll be sure to bring those up in the

646
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,799
last 10 minutes of today's event for

647
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,919
a quick q a with the teams here and i

648
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,840
also just wanted to mention my apologies

649
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,400
dastan

650
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,080
is not on the call today but he has been

651
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,919
instrumental in the development of this

652
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,440
challenge and feedback throughout this

653
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,240
process so

654
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,840
thank you just don and we wish you were

655
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,678
here all right i'll pass it off to our

656
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
panelists

657
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,799
i believe marco uh can you unmute thank

658
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,159
you

659
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,400
sorry about that i'll get an impressive

660
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,279
presentation

661
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,240
good job uh really well thought out i

662
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,200
thought it was really good

663
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,760
how you all broke it down i thought the

664
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,799
pain point was

665
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,440
really you hit the nail on the head with

666
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,080
you know

667
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,760
the bottleneck in the building process

668
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,000
being in the compass stage

669
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,840
that something definitely uh looked like

670
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,360
you addressed

671
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,080
and uh i'm glad you interviewed davide

672
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,720
by the way

673
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,039
a really good friend of ours uh really

674
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,799
amazing builder so i'm

675
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,159
pleased to know that you've got a lot of

676
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,080
insight from davide and

677
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,760
it seems like it showed here in the in

678
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,279
the presentation

679
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,600
um just a couple of things i wanted to

680
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,720
talk about the

681
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,919
mechanism filled bag jason

682
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,159
i thought that earth funnel was really a

683
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,039
great idea

684
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,279
we've done that before not not the way

685
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,960
you presented it we've done

686
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
really basic versions of that with just

687
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,559
a tube but we

688
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,320
really never standardized it in a way

689
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,240
that you all showed it so i think that's

690
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,840
something that we can really implement

691
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,080
um and i think this goes kind of across

692
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,200
the board i think all of these ideas i i

693
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,240
think they can work

694
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,320
it's just a matter of maybe getting a

695
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,919
little bit diving deeper into the

696
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,520
details and seeing how how we can

697
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,960
actually make it happen

698
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,200
but the earth funnel is a great idea i

699
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,120
thought the handle was great

700
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,640
one of the issues we've had with

701
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,880
previous models is using that tube

702
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,200
is that our hands get really tired

703
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,799
because you're just gripping the bag

704
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,080
rather than a handle

705
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,400
that you introduced so really good job

706
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,760
with that

707
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,799
now the earth extruder wow um uh i'd

708
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,880
really like to see that in action

709
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,039
uh i like the idea that it's mechanized

710
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,799
i like the idea that

711
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,480
there's really a machine in in that

712
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,159
process that's pushing the earth in the

713
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:44,799
bag

714
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,760
so i think that could work i have a i

715
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,799
don't know if it's for this

716
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,640
this meeting or another meeting but i

717
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,559
like to see sort of how heavy that

718
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,720
extruder would be maybe we can add a

719
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,159
harness to that

720
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,480
right to decrease the kind of the load

721
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,240
that a person would be bearing

722
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,039
if they were to use that material and

723
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:03,679
just how

724
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,600
just really how it works like a like a

725
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,679
demo right like an animation or

726
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,200
something like that because

727
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,520
if that is quite if it does get heavy

728
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,279
when you load it in the hopper

729
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,960
sort of how how would you balance that

730
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,720
when you're on the dome or

731
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,120
at certain elevations so i'm curious to

732
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,320
see that but

733
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
the earth extruder i think is a really

734
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,720
good idea honestly and i think that kind

735
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,200
of

736
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,559
is with the spirit of what we're trying

737
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,240
to do with

738
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,400
you know using certain mechanized

739
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,080
mechanization in the building so good

740
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,000
job with that

741
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,360
the compass yeah jason good job

742
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,440
compass of the lidar i'm in love with

743
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,360
the lighter alex i really like that

744
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
i do have a question with it you know

745
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,400
how that with the

746
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,200
cell compass uh there any time there's

747
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,880
an obstruction the sale compass

748
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,240
typically gets

749
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,840
you know interfered with and i know

750
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,400
that if you were to put a bag out of

751
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,480
position the lighter would detect that

752
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
but what if there's like a form that's

753
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
in the that's too far

754
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,000
in how would the lidar detect that

755
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,559
right because i'm curious what you mean

756
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,240
by a form that's too far in so the thing

757
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,159
that had occurred to me as far as a

758
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,320
potential pain point for the lidar idea

759
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,880
is that if the form extends in so far

760
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,399
that it effectively obstructs the bag

761
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,360
next to it from

762
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,039
line of sight to the compass that would

763
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,640
be a potential issue that might require

764
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,080
working around where like you're not

765
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,760
quite sure if the bag

766
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,440
past the form is in the way although it

767
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,640
seems to me like that's probably a

768
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,480
problem for the standard chain compass

769
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,360
as well

770
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,279
um could you elaborate a little bit more

771
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,640
what you mean by if the form is in the

772
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,440
right position

773
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,159
sure sure so you i saw that diagram

774
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,240
where you showed that if a bag was too

775
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,200
far in

776
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,679
the lidar would sort of detect that

777
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:44,320
right

778
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,399
well in the in the building there would

779
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,640
there would be um

780
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,720
there would be things that would be

781
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,840
coming in

782
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
quite quite a bit like a form like a

783
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,120
dwarf form

784
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,840
like a window form and how would the

785
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,039
light artist

786
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,039
distinguish that from a bag how would

787
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,320
that ah

788
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,679
i'm saying um so assuming the lidar

789
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,000
scans a section of geometry for instance

790
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,600
that doesn't match the actual

791
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,799
profile for instance um it would detect

792
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,240
a form in the way that it doesn't know

793
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,000
about the geometry of by simply

794
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,640
saying that's an out of position element

795
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,679
i don't know

796
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,919
why that's there and in for instance the

797
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,760
single laser version where it's only

798
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,159
uh painting a pass line and not a fail

799
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,760
line in that case it actually simply

800
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
wouldn't light up that section

801
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,080
of geometry so for instance you would

802
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,000
not see any line on the form and then as

803
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,360
soon as it passed the form and got back

804
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,320
up to bags

805
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
you would see you know a pass line on

806
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,720
the bags or or something of that nature

807
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,000
one possibility um that this

808
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,679
physical hardware allows that would be a

809
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,279
fair bit of extra software

810
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,600
development to enable but entirely

811
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,640
reasonable is

812
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,679
um given an automatic rotation stage so

813
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,440
i'd envisioned this as sort of a

814
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,919
a single cross section where you you

815
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,520
know either with a handle or maybe like

816
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,640
a little remote control or something

817
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,200
like that

818
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,360
you can rotate the the compass to the

819
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,799
angle that you're actually working on

820
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,000
because obviously the same way that you

821
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,159
move the sail to pick like this

822
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,399
angle of wall that i'm currently placing

823
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,919
you'd have to do the same thing with the

824
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,039
lidar compass

825
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,799
so i had envisioned doing that somewhat

826
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,720
manually but if it's automated and if

827
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,399
the compass knows the rotation angle

828
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,760
that it's at all times

829
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,320
you could perfectly reasonably load a

830
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,840
three-dimensional geometry into the

831
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,720
device

832
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,200
and for instance include geometry such

833
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,000
as forms so

834
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,600
if you can well define in cad

835
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,360
what the form looks like for a door or

836
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,600
something like that um you could in fact

837
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,159
use the

838
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,919
the effectively profilometer here to

839
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,440
validate placement of even those

840
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,960
elements or for instance

841
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,440
inbuilt furniture if you're designing a

842
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,799
bed or a couch or something like that

843
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,480
into the geometry of the house

844
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,240
all of those things are enabled by this

845
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,520
hardware

846
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,679
the question is is that you know an

847
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,279
acceptable level of complexity from the

848
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,559
standpoint of planning because obviously

849
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,799
we don't we don't want the tool to

850
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,000
impose some sort of large-scale upfront

851
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,559
planning

852
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,360
that the end user didn't want but it

853
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,240
certainly is

854
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,200
enabled either way okay gotcha no thank

855
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,000
you alex

856
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,600
yeah and that would be the thing just

857
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,679
addressing the discrepancies and the pro

858
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,240
in the inner profile that might exist

859
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,799
with some

860
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,880
additions that we have in the structure

861
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,480
and i think you segued into my next

862
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,919
question with programming

863
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,200
as far as how would you or a user

864
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,799
program this to actually implement it

865
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,520
implement the lidar so the thought in my

866
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,039
mind is effectively

867
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,080
you uh connect to you know the i i

868
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,520
imagine that the lidar

869
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,240
device broadcasts like a you know access

870
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,600
point so you connect to it

871
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,480
via wi-fi with your phone and simply

872
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,360
upload a

873
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,880
a dxf profile of the dome interior

874
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,600
that you expect to build so i know uh

875
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,360
you guys typically build like a lancet

876
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,320
structure dome

877
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,399
as long as you can trace those curves

878
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,519
out in

879
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,640
a dxf autocad sketchup

880
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,519
using 360 whatever it is and export that

881
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,120
as sort of a um

882
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,399
you know uh true scale geometry that's a

883
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,120
flat curve

884
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,799
then the lidar adjusts that and says

885
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,120
okay anything that's on this profile is

886
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,159
what i expect

887
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,799
and i imagine effectively the way that

888
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,080
probably looks

889
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,919
in terms of calibration is you place the

890
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,360
lidar at your center point and then lay

891
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,159
bags around that

892
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,159
or the lidar can also be um

893
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,600
because it's got that real-time visual

894
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
feedback assuming you like take it with

895
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,960
you off the job site and bring it back

896
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,000
the next day right

897
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,519
if it's in position you know every

898
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,039
line that it stands out is going to be a

899
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,440
pass rotationally whereas

900
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,519
if you you know rotate it and this

901
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,360
section of geometry stops passing right

902
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,000
that means you're

903
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,240
off center in the in the in the

904
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,600
positioning of the lidar so you can

905
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,880
effectively

906
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,519
reposition it by just moving it in on

907
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,960
the ground in the center of the dome

908
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,760
until

909
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,600
wherever it scans is currently a pass

910
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,679
assuming you've you know constructed

911
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,360
some amount of geometry to this point

912
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,200
that's already correct okay

913
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,000
okay um but it's it's really in the live

914
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,880
feedback

915
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,360
uh that that you have that sort of

916
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,720
flexibility to know that you've gotten

917
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,760
it right

918
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,799
yes yeah right on alex now

919
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,760
great thank you for that um i i don't

920
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,880
see that

921
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,080
my personally i don't see that as a

922
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,399
adding more complexity i mean it's

923
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,320
another step to have the programming

924
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,120
also on the back end addressed but every

925
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,039
we're all moving towards using phones

926
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,120
i mean we're all that's i don't think

927
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,880
that's something that's alien to anybody

928
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,000
at this point

929
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
uh to be able to upload a profile into a

930
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,519
program and

931
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,840
and use it on a machine i don't think

932
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,000
that's too much of a constraint

933
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,080
so i'd be interested in seeing how we

934
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,120
can also

935
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,840
work on that aspect as well so

936
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,519
um good job everybody i think

937
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,039
so the pvc pipe concept um samira

938
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,880
i really like that i have a question is

939
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,640
that like a did you say that's

940
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,039
sort of like a periscope like a

941
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,480
periscope sort of

942
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,600
radial pipe that you could exp that you

943
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,480
could collapse

944
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,200
and extend because i think that's really

945
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,279
useful

946
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,880
um that's a that's a good lead actually

947
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,120
in our case what we thought was we would

948
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,080
have an element

949
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,480
um in the center and the people could

950
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,679
just slide it in

951
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,799
and out it's just a simple pvc it's not

952
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,840
a periscope

953
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,799
it's just that the actual dimension

954
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,399
would be something you measure from the

955
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:34,960
point

956
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,159
of the edge to the end point and then

957
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,200
you could just

958
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,600
move this if if you're on the let's say

959
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,120
closer to the dome

960
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,760
up top closing everything then you just

961
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,279
slide it more close

962
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,880
so it's just it's just the horizontal

963
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,159
member moving

964
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,559
right or left it's just in place the

965
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,679
center point is the

966
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,159
reference so it's not a periscope it's

967
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,080
the same dimension but you're just

968
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,720
shifting it

969
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,200
i think we lost marco

970
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,280
uh okay you're back

971
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,960
yeah so it's it's the same piece of

972
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
member that's moving

973
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,679
um right and left and enabling people to

974
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,079
just

975
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,119
measure the length and um

976
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,480
yeah that's what's going to give them

977
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,159
different dimensions without having the

978
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,520
need to cut the actual

979
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,560
pvc to different dimensions so that you

980
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,520
can actually just

981
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,560
um have different dimensions for it

982
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,320
even for this one we've been discussing

983
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,560
about a small app

984
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
on the phone where an individual could

985
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,960
put the circumference of the base

986
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,040
and the height of the dome that'll give

987
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,879
them layer wise the distance from the

988
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:45,599
center

989
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,679
which basically also communicates with

990
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,079
the lidar and also for the pool

991
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,320
so if on the side i'm like on the app

992
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,520
and i say hey

993
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,079
sixth layer and based on the feed that

994
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:56,960
i've given in

995
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,640
in the first two columns which is the

996
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
the second friends and the height

997
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,040
it tells me like okay layer six you have

998
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,680
to make

999
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,359
um 1.45 a meter

1000
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,240
of this one so they just put the pvc

1001
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,280
pipe at that length

1002
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,720
and then they don't have to do the whole

1003
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,480
chain thing they don't have to worry

1004
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,000
about it too much

1005
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,920
so and and app interface is something

1006
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,839
that everybody's very comfortable with

1007
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,680
so we're thinking that it's very

1008
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,880
less intrusive but also tech friendly so

1009
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,079
that's something yeah yeah samira i like

1010
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,200
how

1011
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,720
you presented sort of uh one range of

1012
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
the spectrum with the compass

1013
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,599
and alex another i think we can use both

1014
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,079
just depending on the audience we have

1015
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,839
and their skill sets so i i really like

1016
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,400
that

1017
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,599
i'm looking forward to developing that

1018
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,880
with you too so okay good job

1019
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,560
um yeah i those are the questions or the

1020
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,160
feed that's the feedback i have

1021
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,920
um i i could really we can talk about

1022
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,599
this for a long time i know we have a

1023
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,560
limited time

1024
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
uh but i would like to pick up on all of

1025
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,560
these concepts with you all

1026
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,800
but uh i don't know shift or bridget i

1027
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
will also want to give some time to them

1028
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,079
if they have some feedback

1029
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,680
uh before we we wrap it up so

1030
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,800
yeah thanks marco um this is amazing i'm

1031
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,760
um i'm

1032
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,720
i'm really really excited to see sort of

1033
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,839
the

1034
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,839
the next evolution of this technology um

1035
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:26,480
you know when

1036
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,119
when my father developed these ideas you

1037
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,119
know in the early days sort of it

1038
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:31,920
started from

1039
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,240
a single sandbag and it was such a

1040
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,839
labor-intensive in a completely

1041
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,760
different way that every single sandbag

1042
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,520
was picked up individually and filled

1043
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,680
and put on a wall

1044
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
and then we shifted to using small

1045
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,000
coffee cans of soil right and so

1046
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,200
now this idea of being able to

1047
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,280
this i feel like it's it's about

1048
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,839
accuracy the accessibility of accuracy

1049
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:54,800
which is a new

1050
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,440
um a new kind of concept for us which is

1051
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:57,920
that

1052
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,760
if you don't you know necessarily have

1053
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,839
the technical skill and you're losing

1054
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,720
inaccuracy then then there's a

1055
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,599
kind of um it makes the building

1056
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,240
technology

1057
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,200
not as valuable right if you if you're

1058
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,640
not able to do it accurately i did have

1059
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,839
a question about the

1060
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,119
um about that technical the the laser

1061
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,640
compass system

1062
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,680
which is that um so when we build we do

1063
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,160
some

1064
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,760
a lot of like multi-dome buildings right

1065
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,400
it's it's very rarely a single dome i

1066
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,920
mean it's it's sometimes a single dome

1067
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,760
but it's it's a multi-dome

1068
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,200
and you know it's not really like you

1069
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,800
build one dome at a time

1070
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,000
you you build a layer all the way across

1071
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,480
and so kind of how do you account for

1072
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,119
that

1073
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,160
room to room the movement from space to

1074
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
space or is it really that

1075
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,400
if you have one big center dome but

1076
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,760
that's the only one you would really use

1077
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,040
the laser for

1078
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,800
and then on the other spaces you would

1079
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,040
use the the low tech that you know the

1080
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,599
the chain compass or the sail compass

1081
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,280
um because even the thing that you said

1082
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,880
about taking it with you and bringing it

1083
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,839
back right like

1084
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,599
moving it from space to space i'm just

1085
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,119
thinking about i know we're talking

1086
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,800
about really high tech but even an owner

1087
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,440
builder

1088
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,359
you know might build a seven or eight

1089
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,079
dome complex for themselves and so

1090
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,200
they do need to know about kind of

1091
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,040
can you program multiple different

1092
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,640
spaces and that kind of

1093
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,640
pull from the programming something like

1094
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,079
that yeah

1095
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,520
honestly one of the things that i think

1096
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
is most interesting to me and why i'm

1097
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,680
like pretty hot on building this thing

1098
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,680
and prototyping with it is that i think

1099
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,320
it's

1100
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,119
it's really flexible in terms of uh

1101
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,200
allowing exactly the level of complexity

1102
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,040
and level of uh precision that you're

1103
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,839
interested in

1104
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,920
so what i envision being the most

1105
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
accessible and easy option

1106
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,800
is the load a single two-dimensional

1107
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,000
cross-section profile

1108
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,359
into it and it'll tell you whether

1109
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,200
you've hit that cross-section

1110
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,960
um certainly that's useful across

1111
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,640
multiple domes for instance

1112
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,920
imagine i have a dome base here

1113
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,640
uh so call this like my you know a

1114
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,320
one-bedroom or something like that

1115
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,960
i have a large central vault that's you

1116
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,240
know call this one

1117
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,520
a um i don't know five meter diameter

1118
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,560
something relatively

1119
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,400
smaller call this one something like a

1120
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,079
10 meter diameter

1121
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,960
um and they're adjoined by some door for

1122
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,599
instance

1123
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,119
in that super simple case where you're

1124
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,960
only loading a profile a two-dimensional

1125
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,680
profile

1126
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,520
you can position the lidar device at the

1127
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,280
center of that smaller dome

1128
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,839
um manage your layers however you want

1129
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:26,320
and and

1130
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,760
for that matter it'll work in two

1131
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,520
dimensions right if if you're just using

1132
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,560
it to floor plan the

1133
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,280
the first single layer that's totally

1134
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,240
acceptable

1135
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,960
um use it to plan that center dome and

1136
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,359
then

1137
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,320
at that doorway for instance you know

1138
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,680
per my design

1139
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,000
the radius from center of the smaller

1140
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,200
dome to doorway

1141
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,760
is call it uh five meters we said that

1142
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,240
was

1143
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,359
uh or call it two and a half meters um

1144
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,040
then we know the radius from that same

1145
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,640
doorway to the center point of the

1146
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,599
larger dome

1147
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,200
is call it five meters the lidar device

1148
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,880
you can certainly use it to build and

1149
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,240
floor plan both domes

1150
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,640
just simply you know open the interface

1151
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,920
with your phone

1152
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,000
select the larger dome profile when you

1153
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,359
physically move it to the new location

1154
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,880
that's totally an option

1155
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,440
and i the way i envision it is if you

1156
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,040
want to get a whole lot more complex

1157
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,839
about it

1158
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,680
we could certainly increase the

1159
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,200
complexity options

1160
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,160
on the software side by also letting an

1161
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,839
end user

1162
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,720
loading their entire you know cad of the

1163
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,520
entire multi-dome structure for instance

1164
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,040
i don't want to start over-promising

1165
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,079
because this really does make the

1166
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,839
software quite a lot more complex

1167
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,200
but at least the hardware itself is in

1168
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,359
theory perfectly capable of

1169
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,000
uh even potentially localizing itself in

1170
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,720
that space

1171
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,040
so like i don't want to blow the the

1172
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,400
hardware up to the point where it's

1173
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,760
literally a robot that goes around and

1174
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,200
maps the inside of the thing but like

1175
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,800
that is the technology

1176
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,640
that i've worked on previously where

1177
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,160
this is like sort of the thought is

1178
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,119
borne out of

1179
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,160
so it's perfectly attainable

1180
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,240
with a probably more development effort

1181
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,680
than two months allows

1182
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,000
to have literally a measurement device a

1183
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,280
profilometer device

1184
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,480
that sits at any point in the structure

1185
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,800
localizes itself within an at least

1186
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,640
partially built structure already and

1187
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,160
tells you

1188
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,920
whether the structure is accurate

1189
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,839
everywhere so for instance

1190
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,800
imagine i put it in that smaller dome it

1191
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,400
will figure out exactly where it is on

1192
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,920
the floor of that smaller dome

1193
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,000
uh mathematically you know offset its

1194
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,960
model of where it is

1195
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,160
and start painting a you know green

1196
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,480
correct profile everywhere until

1197
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,000
literally the spot that's out of

1198
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,960
out of sync and that doesn't you know in

1199
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
the simple case where it's a 2d profile

1200
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
certainly that requires a lot of uh

1201
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,880
manual you know getting the positioning

1202
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,400
right to make sure that you're on

1203
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,760
on target in the most software complex

1204
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,800
option of this

1205
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,720
the same physical hardware is totally

1206
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,119
capable of of

1207
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,119
you know even a really complex

1208
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,160
positioning itself inside the

1209
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,599
three-dimensional structure

1210
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,160
and also pass failing that structure at

1211
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,440
the same time

1212
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,839
um it's called simultaneous localization

1213
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,200
and mapping although without the mapping

1214
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
component in this case there's

1215
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,640
too much to get into for now but i'm

1216
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,839
certainly happy to entertain that

1217
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,119
conversation

1218
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,640
no that's really helpful i i mean i

1219
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,000
think that's sort of even if you think

1220
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,040
of if it's like a

1221
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,440
seven zones of the house and some are

1222
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,960
sort of the same that

1223
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,800
as long as you could somehow pre-load

1224
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,560
which which location you were in that

1225
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,400
was my question is that sort of

1226
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,359
standard person say it was our eco-dome

1227
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,119
blueprint could they purchase that

1228
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,920
plus this device that's been pre-loaded

1229
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
with all the zones that are in that

1230
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,240
uh blueprint and then they could just

1231
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,160
based on you know sort of a simple

1232
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,319
a b c d e system figure out which

1233
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,680
location um

1234
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,680
yeah my only other question about that

1235
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,599
tool is the durability of it just sort

1236
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,280
of this is a lot of like

1237
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,240
um intense weather climate situations

1238
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,680
you know things need to be able to

1239
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,400
withstand

1240
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,880
um a lot of sun and rain so if that's a

1241
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,560
really sensitive tool

1242
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,520
um and can't be rained on or covered in

1243
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,880
dust all the time

1244
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,839
um what will we do to protect it um i

1245
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:02,560
guess

1246
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
duration of the build is is sometimes

1247
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,760
long and

1248
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,920
a lot happens so that's that's my only

1249
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,240
other the other two sort of seemed

1250
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,440
you know durable type material but this

1251
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:13,920
one is

1252
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,359
the sensitivity of it is what's

1253
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,520
important so um but it's a very cool

1254
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,480
idea

1255
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,160
in the vein of under promising and over

1256
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,400
delivering i will promise you

1257
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,319
that the initial prototype will not

1258
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,560
tolerate more than a few months of being

1259
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,520
out in a dust storm

1260
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,560
but it is entirely sealable like

1261
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,359
like consider a laser level that you

1262
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,319
might find from

1263
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,839
dewalt or milwaukee or something like

1264
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,359
that surely you've seen

1265
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,119
you know the 400 device that you can get

1266
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,040
from home depot that sits up on a tripod

1267
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,480
automatically levels itself and gives

1268
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
you like vertical and horizontal

1269
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,400
cross-section lines to like meter you

1270
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,240
know the reason that you can

1271
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,319
build something like that as durable as

1272
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,280
that is is because

1273
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,880
it only has to see out through a clear

1274
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,040
window um all of that's true of this

1275
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,160
device as well

1276
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,800
it's perfectly reasonable to to build a

1277
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,920
construction where it's physically

1278
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,040
weather sealed and i don't

1279
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,160
think that that ends up being

1280
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
substantially more expensive or complex

1281
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,119
than the

1282
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,839
super simplest you know 350 budget thing

1283
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,440
that we're talking about here

1284
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,200
um might fall outside of the realm of

1285
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,200
two months of development effort but

1286
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,800
like i do think this is perfectly

1287
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,560
scalable to the level of durability that

1288
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,359
you need

1289
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,480
great jason a question for you um

1290
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,640
so this device that you're describing um

1291
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,839
the the sort of handheld what what is

1292
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,000
the person on the other side using

1293
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,800
to fill the two so is it just is it a

1294
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,160
two-person job

1295
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,680
it just sort of wasn't i couldn't

1296
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,280
totally visualize it'd be helpful if

1297
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,400
there was like a

1298
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,160
kind of animation or something that

1299
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,520
showed what it looks like the person

1300
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,440
that's holding it and then the person

1301
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
is it a different person filling it or

1302
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,560
or is it the

1303
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,319
material coming flowing in from

1304
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,240
somewhere what does that look like in

1305
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:52,720
your

1306
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,720
in your idea uh it'd be largely the same

1307
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,560
as the process now like someone using

1308
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
buckets just to feed in but it's more

1309
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,440
just to ease

1310
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,680
the the task of the person that has to

1311
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
open the bag and keep like shifting the

1312
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,480
bag along

1313
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,119
um just to take away a bit of the uh the

1314
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,960
like awkwardness of that process like

1315
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,560
having to fold it having to

1316
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,880
move it manually so it'd still be a

1317
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,079
two-person process

1318
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,880
it doesn't assist in any way with uh

1319
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,480
moving the material from the ground it

1320
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,160
would still be like the coffee bucket

1321
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,960
system

1322
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,000
but it's literally just to uh just uh to

1323
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,440
hold the bag open

1324
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,800
okay another person christmas tree fly

1325
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,640
through and i just wasn't sure what

1326
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,880
what if you had something oh yeah yeah

1327
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,920
yeah there's not many

1328
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,560
videos of that uh that machine on the

1329
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,640
internet that was the most like

1330
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,880
uh communicative one i could find but

1331
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,319
it's more like a steady

1332
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,960
flow like usual the christmas juice just

1333
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,880
representing like one bucket of dark

1334
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,119
going through and you just go imagine

1335
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,800
consistent flow of christmas trees

1336
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,680
um and samira i had a question for you

1337
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,880
as well so

1338
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,200
in this um sort of i'm going to use the

1339
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,800
periscope i think that helped me

1340
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,960
visualize what marco was saying is that

1341
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,880
you know you need to be able to increase

1342
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,960
and decrease the distance at each layer

1343
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,319
and you're saying maybe there's an app

1344
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,440
that tells you

1345
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,000
at level number 17 you know this should

1346
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,280
be the distance

1347
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,480
um but it just

1348
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,079
i guess i'm wondering like you know in

1349
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,680
in the sale or in the chain compass

1350
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,440
system there's a little bit more nuance

1351
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,599
the way that like the curvature happens

1352
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:26,319
versus

1353
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,240
i was just sort of imagining if it's a

1354
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,240
if it's sort of stick stick stick stick

1355
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:30,960
stick do you

1356
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,000
lose the that the curve

1357
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,599
you know kind of what what is is there a

1358
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,680
way to like angle that piece in the edge

1359
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,200
so that it keeps like

1360
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,319
the smoothness of the of the edge line

1361
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,800
um but otherwise i really like this the

1362
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,200
simplicity of that idea that you can use

1363
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,359
any kind of you know if you figured out

1364
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,359
the right like hooking system for the

1365
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,319
center pole

1366
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,079
or whatever to move that piece through

1367
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,520
and you knew the lengths

1368
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,599
but how would you how would you resolve

1369
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,599
yeah the shape to keep it so it doesn't

1370
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:00,880
feel like um

1371
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,920
you know pyramid i guess right

1372
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,640
yeah um definitely i hear you completely

1373
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,240
the profile curve

1374
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,280
is definitely a concern because now it's

1375
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,640
more in visual

1376
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,119
pipe pipe pipe segment segment segment

1377
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:15,839
segment

1378
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,160
so the curvature feature of it and

1379
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,040
doesn't uh

1380
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,079
completely arrive

1381
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,720
and each segment the curve is changing

1382
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,160
based on the derm shape

1383
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,800
so that does um still appear and that's

1384
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,800
why the profile sale is so helpful

1385
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,000
for someone to reference it but here we

1386
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,200
do not have that

1387
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,800
we do have the center point of the

1388
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,280
sandbag like or the earth bag where it

1389
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,400
has to be

1390
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,359
and then uh if the bag is right here

1391
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,839
this could be at the edge of it

1392
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,079
so giving that oh the back is here and

1393
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,400
the next one arrives a little more

1394
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,040
and yeah it is segment but even when

1395
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,440
you're

1396
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,240
kind of 3d printing or laying the bags

1397
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,359
on top

1398
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,040
it is at a micro level a segment segment

1399
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,680
segment

1400
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,480
leading to a curve so in the grander

1401
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,119
version

1402
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,240
um it would be a segment one

1403
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,960
and based on the accuracy of the let's

1404
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,880
say the phone enabling them oh you're in

1405
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,680
the 14th layer you're in the 15th player

1406
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,920
i think um it would definitely ease

1407
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,680
their

1408
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,800
dimensioning but yeah the curvature

1409
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,240
aspect is um not there

1410
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,200
i'll say this i'll say this real quick i

1411
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,520
should

1412
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,240
i shouldn't be an issue i believe

1413
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,839
because every time we calibrate

1414
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,400
it's always at a point at one point at

1415
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,680
every row

1416
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,400
so even if it's the face that we're not

1417
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,839
capturing in the

1418
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,880
compass it's just a point at every row

1419
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,720
i think her concept is the same where

1420
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,400
it's just capturing one point

1421
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,200
at every row so it still ends up being

1422
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,880
the same i think

1423
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,839
um but and and i think we're out of time

1424
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:56,319
but

1425
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,400
maybe maybe uh samara we can talk about

1426
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,720
this offline but my question would be

1427
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,440
you know there's going to be a lot of

1428
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,319
decimals

1429
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,359
when you cut the length of every radius

1430
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,599
pole you know it's going to be a lot of

1431
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,119
decimals so

1432
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,280
how do you how do you measure and cut

1433
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,480
that in a way that's

1434
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,040
easy for people to do you know it's

1435
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,960
people who don't have carpentry skills

1436
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,200
measurement skills is there something

1437
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,160
that can

1438
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,119
do that for them i think would be

1439
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:26,480
something to think about too

1440
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,839
so definitely we'll we'll take it back

1441
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:30,480
to the

1442
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,240
drawing board and think about that

1443
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,240
definitely yeah yeah

1444
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,000
one other thought i just had about

1445
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,440
samira's idea

1446
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,200
is that you know it doesn't have to be a

1447
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,880
replacement tool it could be a really

1448
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,480
nice complementary tool

1449
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,280
to the chain compass that um something

1450
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,520
we've used in the past is sometimes will

1451
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,760
affix like a pull at the center and then

1452
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,040
you know sort of just so that you don't

1453
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,880
have to keep checking the compass it

1454
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,880
sort of allows you to more simply

1455
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,240
manage it so this is a really

1456
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,480
interesting it could be a complementary

1457
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,800
tool that is very simple to

1458
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,119
utilize right the piece that moves every

1459
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,400
layer um

1460
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,000
could be really simple to set up and use

1461
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,520
with the chain compass so i think

1462
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,960
there's definitely something there i

1463
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,200
look forward to hearing more about that

1464
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,598
definitely

1465
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,280
well i just wanted to say that i don't

1466
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,920
have too much to add to uh

1467
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,960
marco and sheikha's comments

1468
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,920
i would like to echo though um the

1469
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,800
excitement

1470
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,520
that they both shared and uh well done

1471
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,480
to alex

1472
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,800
samara and jason thank you very much um

1473
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,640
i'm looking forward to seeing

1474
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,280
the development of the prototypes and so

1475
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,119
will our greater calories community to

1476
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,800
be sure

1477
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,319
i did have just uh one comment for

1478
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,520
jason in terms of the earth shoot i

1479
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,720
i didn't hear that you interviewed lisa

1480
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,359
starr

1481
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,359
from bonita domes she is a strong voice

1482
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,720
in our community

1483
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,800
an owner builder and i have her contact

1484
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,760
information i do know on her build

1485
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,559
that they did use a shoot as marco

1486
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:09,920
mentioned it's something that we've done

1487
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,720
before

1488
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,599
without a handle but if my memory serves

1489
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:14,480
me correctly

1490
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,760
lisa star actually did use a handle with

1491
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,720
their shoe

1492
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,040
on their build and i know that she said

1493
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,720
there were some

1494
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,599
um difficulties and so you may want to

1495
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,359
speak to her about that

1496
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,400
um as you further develop the prototype

1497
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,640
and then i had one other question for

1498
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,520
alex

1499
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,720
i'm just assuming that the lidar

1500
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,319
laser will work for the foundation rings

1501
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,480
below grade

1502
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,119
yeah so effectively the lidar will work

1503
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,640
for

1504
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,520
any point above it certainly and

1505
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,240
probably

1506
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,160
a substantial number of points below it

1507
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,240
i mean this is one of the things where

1508
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,599
we'll have to get into prototyping

1509
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,160
to decide exactly what's most useful or

1510
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,040
not but

1511
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,960
effectively the lidar definitely can see

1512
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,280
anything above it and profile that way

1513
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,280
so the only thing to keep track of is

1514
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,640
that the lidar

1515
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,960
is at a fixed height relative to the

1516
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,760
base ring

1517
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,559
so when you set those base rings you dig

1518
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:13,839
out effectively a

1519
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,559
pit and place those base rings under the

1520
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,880
ambient level of ground but above the

1521
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,720
the floor level of the interior of the

1522
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,720
dome correct

1523
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,559
yes yeah so as long as the lidar is

1524
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,640
positioned on the floor of the dome

1525
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,680
you're good to go okay and certainly it

1526
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,119
could be made to be other than that if

1527
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,440
for some reason it's necessary

1528
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,319
okay good to know

1529
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,720
all right i'm sorry i'm gonna have to

1530
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,680
interrupt the

1531
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,319
discussion there and get to the comments

1532
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,280
from our

1533
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,760
um our live audience but thank you so

1534
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,400
much

1535
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,400
to the calif team for their insight and

1536
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,319
feedback and it sounds like there's lots

1537
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:51,280
to be discussed

1538
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,599
um in the coming weeks so we're excited

1539
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,200
to see how all this develops

1540
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,200
all right we got some great questions in

1541
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,200
the comments section and i see

1542
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,520
alex even started to answer some so

1543
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,200
you've gotten ahead of us here

1544
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,640
but let's get started how effective is a

1545
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,520
single unit

1546
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,640
or would two increase precision

1547
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,559
i'm wondering if they're do you guys

1548
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:13,760
know what they're referring to there let

1549
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,880
me see

1550
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,960
uh quite tell if they were referring to

1551
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,040
the lidar or the pipe compass or

1552
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,000
yeah the more the merrier frankly i'm

1553
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,960
happy to

1554
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,480
answer that positively for all of the

1555
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,040
devices we've discussed

1556
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,480
buy more of them from cal earth

1557
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,640
all right and uh

1558
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,040
next question was which solution would

1559
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:37,760
be more

1560
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,599
adept at handling retrofits to the

1561
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,040
building for example

1562
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,800
if they want to make any extensions with

1563
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,400
the lidar be better since it would be

1564
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,200
programmable

1565
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,160
um for my part i don't know that i have

1566
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,680
strong feelings about this one or the

1567
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,240
other

1568
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,400
the usefulness of all of those profiling

1569
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,520
tools the both the

1570
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,400
sale the pipe sale the the lidar compass

1571
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,240
the point is really to get bags

1572
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,960
in a vaulted construction in the right

1573
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,920
positions

1574
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,240
as far as retrofitting is concerned i'm

1575
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,079
not sure how necessary that is unless

1576
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,839
for instance you plan on

1577
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,040
um building a an additional dome onto

1578
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,640
you know the exterior doorway of a

1579
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,079
present dome or that sort of thing which

1580
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,920
i can certainly envision but

1581
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,599
i don't think it makes a huge difference

1582
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,760
either way and in reality

1583
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,200
in that case where you were building a

1584
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,839
second dome on an existing

1585
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,960
entryway um

1586
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,000
really either of them allow you to

1587
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,760
accomplish the same task because both of

1588
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,760
them will successfully pass obstructions

1589
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,480
you know if the

1590
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,559
first dome is protruding into the

1591
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:41,599
geometry of the second

1592
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,079
etc

1593
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,799
all right thank you alex um another one

1594
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,720
was how stable is it with strong winds

1595
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,000
i'm assuming they mean

1596
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,440
the uh the measurement pull concept

1597
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,839
yeah um with the profile

1598
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,240
structure as well you will be fixing it

1599
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,240
at a point in the center

1600
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,359
it could be a circular hole

1601
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,079
in the slab that you're making where you

1602
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:12,480
fix

1603
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,599
it and then you remove it

1604
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,040
it would require some um ground level

1605
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,280
work which could be filled in with

1606
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,680
uh cement or other kind of round clay

1607
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,319
that you would

1608
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,520
you would do normally for your site so

1609
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,960
that should be needed in

1610
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,960
every room let's say if you have a

1611
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,799
multi-derm structure

1612
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,440
and then you would since the pvc is a

1613
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,680
low-cost one you would have different

1614
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,599
central poles put in in the time of the

1615
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,319
foundation itself and then you take in

1616
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:45,280
the custom

1617
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,079
uh press fit joint that you'll be making

1618
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,760
and you just press it

1619
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,559
onto the center pole so it would be

1620
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,559
strong in terms of let's say

1621
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,960
winds or something because it would be

1622
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:03,760
fixed point to the ground

1623
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,559
i hope that answers the question thanks

1624
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:07,599
samira

1625
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,920
and uh last question here can the

1626
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,160
lighter uh

1627
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,119
oh sorry why not stereo camera vision

1628
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,400
instead of lidar

1629
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,240
someone mentioned they might it might be

1630
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,520
cheaper

1631
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,319
yeah i like that comment um in my

1632
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,799
experience stereo vision

1633
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,040
isn't cheaper for this particular super

1634
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,640
low price point so

1635
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,599
so because we're talking about a really

1636
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,520
like simple basic lidar that happens to

1637
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,880
only cost a hundred bucks

1638
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,440
like the off-the-shelf uh stereo vision

1639
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,200
solutions that i'm aware of around that

1640
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,880
at the cheap end around that same price

1641
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,720
point that said

1642
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,400
we do have some advantages in our

1643
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,079
particular use case where stereo vision

1644
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,000
might actually be plausibly cheaper for

1645
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,640
instance

1646
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,440
those solutions those uh more expensive

1647
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,119
stereo vision solutions tend to be

1648
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,400
expensive because you have to

1649
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,920
synchronize the two cameras really

1650
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,160
precisely whereas in the case that the

1651
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,359
device isn't moving

1652
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,319
and the object in the scene also isn't

1653
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:03,119
moving

1654
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,960
that's not really necessarily a concern

1655
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,640
so it's plausible that we could actually

1656
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,240
do it cheaper

1657
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,760
my gut feeling as far as lidar is

1658
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,359
concerned is that

1659
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,160
this is the fastest and easiest way to

1660
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,359
prototype the device

1661
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:16,880
so it certainly seems reasonable that we

1662
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,559
might consider that for a future rev

1663
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:19,359
where

1664
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,040
yeah you could you could potentially get

1665
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,559
a little bit faster and

1666
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,599
and cheaper overall device performance

1667
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,720
under such you know limited uh

1668
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,240
deployment scenario

1669
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,520
it's worth looking into thank you

1670
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,480
great thanks alex all right well that

1671
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,040
just about wraps up our time for today's

1672
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,680
event i want to ask that our amazing

1673
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,440
participants today just hang on

1674
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,920
