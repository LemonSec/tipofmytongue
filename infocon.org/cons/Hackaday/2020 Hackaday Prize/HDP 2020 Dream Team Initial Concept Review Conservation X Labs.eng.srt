we're so excited to have everyone here

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,960
for our dream team concept review

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,320
this is the first year that we're doing

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,720
the dream team initiative as part of our

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,320
2020 hackaday

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,359
uh prize and essentially what we did was

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,000
recruit

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,760
three innovators for each of our

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,519
non-profit partners so today we're going

15
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,400
to check in

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,560
with the conservationx live stream team

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,840
and see what they've developed over the

18
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,280
last couple of weeks

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,040
we're so excited to have sam kelly

this

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,759
without our sponsors so we have to take

42
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,920
a moment to thank our sponsor supply

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,840

44
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
arm their continued support to open

45
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,880
source solutions

46
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,799
is wonderful and powerful and we're so

47

53
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,159
and who can give you a little bit more

54
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,680
of an introduction to the challenge they

55
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
are addressing today

56
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,399
thank you magenta hello everyone we

57
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,479
are here today for the abstract and

58
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,960
concept review for the conservation x

59
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
stream team challenge

60
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,680
the team includes aaron in kingston

61
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,880
canada

62
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,159
toby in ibadan nigeria

63
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,759
and leonardo in laguarda venezuela

64
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,200
so hi everyone thank you for being here

65
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,920
the conservation x challenge 6

66
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,679
innovations that reduce

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,760
the time that fishing gear has to be

68
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,800
left in the water

69
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
unnecessarily to help reduce waste

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,959
and risk to marine species that can get

71
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,520
trapped

72
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,599
in abandoned or ghost gear

73
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,800
so with us with a challenge as big as

74
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
the ocean

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,080
the problem has to be framed to a more

76
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,760
specific context

77
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,720
to make it manageable leveraging their

78
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,080
different locations

79
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,239
the team has gathered information that

80
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,680
is useful for proposing

81
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,480
the first alternatives to help mitigate

82
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,760
this problem

83
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,640
so sam thank you so much for for your

84
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,040
help and invaluable feedback during this

85
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,080
first week and for being here today

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,800
today's meeting is about presenting the

87
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,599
findings

88
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,480
of the team's research and start

89
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,800
discussing their first ideas

90
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,680
so now on to you conservationx dream

91
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
team

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,440

uh leonardo world from venezuela

98
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,400
so the name of our concept

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,680
is ajah ajah is a

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,879
european name for fish from europa land

101
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,000
in nigeria where i'm

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,959
where i came from and um we're going to

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,799
be talking about you know food details

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,920
as we move forward

105
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,640
next slide please

106
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,959
so we've highlighted different concepts

107
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,200
i'll be discussing today which is

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,480
the research insights the purpose

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,319
and also you know we'll talk about the

110
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,519
direction we want to go

111
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,480
implementation and discussion next like

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
this

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,280
so there are data that we try to analyze

114
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,360
online by making our research

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
and we realized that ghost year is

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,399
always been lost

117
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,798
in our ocean all over the world and this

118
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:19,600
caused a lot of

119
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,400
hazards to shift navigation and of

120
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,440
course safety of the

121
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,960
of the sea and this brought to us to now

122
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,479
have a discussion with

123
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,120
our fishermen to kind of understand uh

124
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,880
the pain points of our fishermen let's

125
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,360
like this

126
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,440
and some of the pain point that we

127
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,120
realize while

128
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
you know discussing with them or

129
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
probably checking online as well

130
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,600
is that most times uh the environment is

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,639
kind of very ash

132
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,600
and they need to do a lot of things with

133
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
limited time

134
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,919
alongside with that uh they have to also

135
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,080
debate the traps every day

136
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,880
and there is no standard or income for

137
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,080
all the fishermen

138
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,479
which makes it unpredictable you know

139
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,840
for the fish stock

140
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,759
so they have limited budget as well you

141
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,520
know little money to do little things

142
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,120
and they couldn't even have a budget for

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,560
some certain things

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
and let's talk about legislation you

145
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,759
know different communities with

146
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,080
different legislation for example

147
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,560
in nigeria they have a community of

148
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,440
fishermen

149
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,000
no one can come from any other community

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,199
to fish in that

151
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,639
particular sea so of course there's also

152
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,639
country wise uh legislation that oh you

153
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,919
have to follow these truths and

154
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,560
regulations lastly about some of their

155
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,320
pain points that we realized

156
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,560
they also felt affected about the loss

157
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,520
of care i

158
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,440
don't want to you know cause any

159
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,520
entanglement anymore

160
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,240
next slide please

161
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
all right so our white thinking true

162
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,199
we realize that there's a problem

163
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,400
and it's so critical in our hearts how

164
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
might we decrease

165
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,639
marine species and targets and ghost

166
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,840
gear creation

167
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,479
you know how can we do this this is one

168
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,720
of our critical points that is

169
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,800
a problem to us of course while making

170
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,720
this research we also feel like

171
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,639
how are commercial fishing process be

172
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,800
more data driven

173
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,639
how can we use this data to know the

174
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,400
mind of our fishermen

175
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
how can we use this data to kind of

176
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,520
become in which

177
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,479
or which innovative solution we can

178
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,639
bring into this space

179
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,319
how can we use this data to understand

180
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,960
how this concept would be more data

181
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,400
driven

182
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,919
next slide please as you know that we

183
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,160
are

184
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
all located in different part of the

185
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,960
world nigeria canada venezuela

186
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,160
it gave us more in-depth research and

187
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,520
data to know

188
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,080
what we're going to be solving for one

189
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,280
of the pain points

190
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,560
about information that we gather is that

191
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,720
they don't really need they don't look

192
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,080
for any information when they want to go

193
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,960
out for fishing

194
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,599
they wake up at 5am and they just go out

195
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,479
for fishing

196
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,000
they don't care about a lot of other

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,440
things that probably there's a procedure

198
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,400
they need to follow

199
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,440
or not and the most interesting part of

200
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,919
this

201
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,440
is having a conversation with one of

202
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,199
these fisher men

203
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,080
and they said hey aja when you are done

204
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,120
with the solution

205
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,800
you need to come test with us you want

206
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,160
to be the first tester

207
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,039
but then at the back of their mind they

208
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:21,840
kind of

209
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,160
you know they're not so guests along

210
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,759
with new technology you know when you

211
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,680
bring new technology to some sort of

212
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,160
species they be like this is kind of new

213
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,639
we've been fishing for 100 years

214
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,319
why are you telling us that your

215
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,319
intelligence boeing system

216
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,039
would solve our problem now i'm going to

217
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,479
pass you to leo

218
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,240
and he will continue forward with the

219
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,880
presentation

220
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,800
there is a very important dialogue that

221
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,879
needs to be held for change

222
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,639
there's a discussion that needs to

223
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,479
include researchers

224
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,199
teachers and visionaries they have a

225
00:07:59,199 --> 00:07:59,680
different

226
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,319
approach for the problem and they have a

227
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,759
different point of view what is

228
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,360
important what is it that we need to

229
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,919
follow

230
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,919
um depending on what is the their

231
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,599
relationship with the environment

232
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,080
and the planets and also their

233
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
legislations and regulations

234
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,800
uh some of them international and

235
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
sometime national

236
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,759
they play a hero because they import

237
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,560
new ideas new techniques and they also

238
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:24,960
help

239
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,160
introduce the need for new digital

240
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,280
skills training and innovative solutions

241
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,000
my phone please

242
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,839
now let's talk about our proposal

243
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,000
first let's review a quick summary a

244
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,480
solutions map that we prefer to try to

245
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
have an overview of the different

246
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,519
solutions

247
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,160
that are available to us to avoid gear

248
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,720
loss

249
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,839
we have uh we could talk about wiggling

250
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,240
position marking and robles three

251
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,880
different

252
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,760
categories uh weaklings are ropes that

253
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,360
are specifically designed

254
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,440
to break under specific amount of

255
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,320
pressure and there they are very helpful

256
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,519
to redesign some traps or to include

257
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,320
in the traps or in the gear so if that

258
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,680
if the gear becomes

259
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,399
growthier that is lost in the ocean the

260
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,760
targeted species

261
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,720
can eventually break the trap and get

262
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,839
out of the of the truck

263
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,680
making it people for professional

264
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,240
marketing uh if you're able to define

265
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,440
the specific location where the buoy

266
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,480
and where the gear is placed but also to

267
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
have some type of communication

268
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,680
and some type of exchange of information

269
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
for position marking there are different

270
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,959
alternatives

271
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,360
there are radio beacons within very high

272
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,440
frequency radio signals

273
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,279
gps who is the buoys including gps for

274
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,640
for location acoustic becomes that they

275
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,920
emit signals and they

276
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,560
transmit information from underwater and

277
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
they usually

278
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,399
the pressures need to use hydrophones to

279
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,760
detect those signals

280
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,560
uh our automatic identification system

281
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,200
is

282
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,320
also for define the location and for

283
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,480
navigation and rfid

284
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,800
to read information from the buoy from

285
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,279
for a closer distance but it can also

286
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,040
the rfid can be

287
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,720
active can be passive it can be

288
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,200
it can be written from a hundred meters

289
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,040
away and have some verification of

290
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,120
origin and important information

291
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
but also there are different

292
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,200
alternatives to attract fish

293
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,600
uh there are the commonly used lights

294
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,040
but there also are

295
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,079
fats fish aggregation devices those are

296
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,440
devices specifically created to mimic

297
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,680
from uh some objects that attract fish

298
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,519
and to their specifically sense to

299
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,600
attract several types of fish

300
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,760
fish aggregation devices are normally

301
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,600
included to

302
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,680
indicate to improve efficiency

303
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:15,839
next complete

304
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,120
so while trying to brainstorm some

305
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,480
ideas for these solutions we came up

306
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,440
with a few

307
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,720
outlandish ideas including a cyborg

308
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,680
lobster

309
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,959
that would be within the trap and

310
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,640
speak with the other lobsters to

311
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,600
understand their animal behavior

312
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
or how about a robot starfish that

313
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,680
attaches on to

314
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,320
say a gill net gear and if it becomes

315
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,160
ghost gear it starts to fold

316
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,519
into itself to reduce the surface area

317
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,720
or even a rope elevator on the vertical

318
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,360
lines

319
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,079
that goes up and down and communicates

320
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,839
with the surrounding wildlife

321
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,800
now let's talk about the solution

322
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,880
concept

323
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,160
now let's talk about the solution

324
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,959
concept based on our research

325
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,760
uh from uh specifically a very important

326
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,600
a research paper that we found that

327
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,240
includes

328
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,200
a review of 40 42 different papers let's

329
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
talk about

330
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,160
how ghost gear impacts different

331
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,720
locations and

332
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,519
it's a favorite from 2016 we know that

333
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,000
10 percent of identified

334
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,360
goals here were rows uh broke from traps

335
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,880
and pulse this is what we call the

336
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
vertical lines and

337
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
somehow some gears have intermediate

338
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,959
lines but they are not that present

339
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,959
they are not as risky as the vertical

340
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,399
lines uh

341
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,079
the other percent the other ninety

342
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,440
percent come from

343
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,120
nests monofilament

344
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,920
fishing gear but there's also there's

345
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,160
also another aspect that is important to

346
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,279
take into account

347
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,000
that is the ghost fishing efficiency

348
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,560
when the trap becomes uh

349
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,360
goes here how is their efficiency and

350
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,959
how is their catch rate

351
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,079
for the net the ghost fishing efficiency

352
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,360
can decrease rapidly because once it is

353
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,880
performed the catch

354
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,800
it goes to the bottom of the oceans and

355
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,720
then the the

356
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,440
the efficiency decreases rapidly uh for

357
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,720
the troublesome costs

358
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,360
uh is this is different it's not that

359
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,240
easy but it's

360
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,720
it's well understood that the efficiency

361
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,320
is higher because they

362
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,880
do not deteriorate us faster and they

363
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,720
are not affected as they catch

364
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,040
what is important is what it changes is

365
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,000
the bait

366
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,839
if the bait doesn't work anymore it

367
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,440
doesn't attract fish

368
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,480
but the currently attractive fish

369
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,600
can be the new bait for new for new

370
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,560
species

371
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
uh for that uh focusing on on traps and

372
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,000
pots

373
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
and seeing how the vertical lines on

374
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,199
such a high

375
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,519
problem we think including to our

376
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,880
solution concept

377
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,440
a roblox system to avoid vertical lines

378
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,079
uh and also an intelligent way for

379
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,279
position marking

380
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,480
and communication uh once the roblox

381
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,120
system

382
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,839
uh the roblox system deploys in the

383
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,600
roblox system

384
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,839
actually have vertical lines when they

385
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,920
but when the buoy goes to the surface

386
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,120
we're going to uh explain it more

387
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,800
later uh there is a need for a means of

388
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,320
communication and to have the new

389
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,760
location of the bully

390
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,839
we also it's very important to have a

391
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,120
modular design

392
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,880
for more adaptability and

393
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
the we think since there are different

394
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,079
types of gear

395
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,639
and some of them present a higher risk

396
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,320
from different characteristics

397
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
from the beginning when thinking of a

398
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,920
moderate descent that can be

399
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,600
in the future that can be changed to

400
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,240
adapt

401
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,880
to specific types of gear and also

402
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,079
there's the monitor

403
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,639
of your capacity that is a part of the

404
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,320
device that is going to check

405
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,120
the capacity of the truck and to deploy

406
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,079
the buoy on

407
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,959
on deploy the way and so the features

408
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,240
can retrieve

409
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,279
the gear when the track is full of

410
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,199
course we understand that there can need

411
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,959
to be compliance with the

412
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,600
regulations local regulations um for the

413
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,279
agreements that are being

414
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,519
created before marine mammal

415
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,199
conservation that is a very important

416
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,120
topic to keep in mind

417
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,759
next monthly

418
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,320
but okay how can we

419
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,959
imagine and how did all these elements

420
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,040
that have been recently mentioned how do

421
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,480
they work together

422
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
we have in our image we can see the

423
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,360
travel visual representation of the trap

424
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,720
and how of the elements what we call the

425
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,079
roblox system

426
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,800
there's intelligent buoy and the monitor

427
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,320
but let's see how it work

428
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,120
and how the features interact with it

429
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,800
with this technology

430
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,519
next one please

431
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,160
in the first part of the futures journey

432
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,279
they deploy their trust onto the seat

433
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,120
and before they deploy they need to

434
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,560
attach the device

435
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,199
to the truck uh before and when it's

436
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,880
when it's been attached and before the

437
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,720
deployment it's a good moment to

438
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,920
do the position marking and to have to

439
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,720
know

440
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,600
which was the specific place when the

441
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,480
trap was

442
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,800
deployed and verificated the initial

443
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,120
point

444
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,800
exactly

445
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,199
now let's visualize what it means to be

446
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,560
a roblox mechanism

447
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,000
a roblox mechanism means that the buoy

448
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
that we can see on the on the image the

449
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,079
buoy uh

450
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,560
is attached to the trap and their

451
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,759
complete mechanism

452
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,000
is under water and it is all tied

453
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,959
together

454
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,920
uh if if it wasn't for the device the

455
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,800
rope will be

456
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,639
uh connected to the wheel but the pulley

457
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,920
will be in the surface

458
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,440
creating what is called the vertical

459
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,760
line so in here

460
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,679
during the catch we can see that the

461
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,599
trap is attached

462
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,438
to the device my phone please

463
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,119
and finally for the retrieval when

464
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,760
the trap has been uh underwater this

465
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
pretty fine amount of time

466
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,640
can be 24 hours 48 hours

467
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,960
72 hours the specific amount of time

468
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,480
that the fishers define

469
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,039
for the truck to be performing the catch

470
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,919
the device

471
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,559
releases the buoy uh and the way it goes

472
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,600
to the surface

473
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,960
so it creates an attachment and also

474
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,000
the buoy sends and transmits their

475
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,679
location to the fishers

476
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,720
the fishers can find the buoy

477
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,120
because of because the retransmits their

478
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,240
location and they can retrieve the gear

479
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,480
but in this case the vertical line that

480
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,280
we can see

481
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,440
in the in the image attaching the buoy

482
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
and the trap

483
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,760
it's only been deployed once

484
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,400
it has once they have to retrieve the

485
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
gear

486
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,120
next one please

487
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,520
and finally once the teachers are

488
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,360
receiving the female from the location

489
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,240
of the buoy

490
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,280
they need to they need a means they need

491
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,160
a tool

492
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,440
to identify and to view the new location

493
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
for the buoy for them we have a

494
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,480
navigation app

495
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,559
there are different alternatives already

496
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,679
out there they are

497
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,600
different private alternatives like

498
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,919
navionics or infects

499
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,559
there are open source alternatives for

500
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,120
navigation like opencpn

501
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,600
and therefore for different techniques

502
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,640
that we can use

503
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,679
using the gps and offline maps

504
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,880
to find and to use the phone as a easy

505
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,360
access

506
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,799
interface for the features to

507
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,960
have the or to know the location of the

508
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,200
truck

509
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,160
now i'll leave you with uh my teammate

510
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,840
erin candy

511
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
um

512
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,360
okay all right it's working now

513
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,400
sorry about that okay

514
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,280
so we talked about the concept and now

515
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,799
how are we going to make

516
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,840
this idea into a reality

517
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,520
the project first consists of three main

518
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,559
components

519
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,160
the first one being a ropeless

520
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,679
adaptation as

521
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,640
leo has described this integrates onto

522
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,559
the existing gear

523
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,280
then there's the intelligent buoy when

524
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,080
it reaches the

525
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,880
surface of the water it will receive the

526
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,520
gps

527
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,000
coordinates and communicate it then

528
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,280
there's the monitor of gear capacity

529
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,120
there are some major constraints with

530
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,640
this

531
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
primarily being that we're working in a

532
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,760
harsh environment

533
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,799
with the water we aim to have a minimum

534
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,080
battery life of 72 hours

535
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,880
there should be an ac power supply on

536
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,240
the boat

537
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,080
and the fissure should have a mobile

538
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,080
phone in order to see the data

539
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,559
let's talk a little bit more about the

540
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,159
monitor

541
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,200
so presently fishers evaluate the trap

542
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,919
location

543
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,720
based on their intuition they see the

544
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,919
bait levels

545
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,720
they see how much catch they receive and

546
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,880
they see where some of the competition

547
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,080
is the monitor addresses a gap

548
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,880
that fishers do not know which is the

549
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,039
fish traffic around the trash

550
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,360
and the time at which the fish enter the

551
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,678
trap

552
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,000
when the chat is brought to the surface

553
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,280
for re-baiting

554
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,000
then the data can be transferred and we

555
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,480
know

556
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,840
from our interviews with fishers

557
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,240
that lobster and prawn traps are rebated

558
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,640
every one to three days

559
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,200
from this a fisher would possibly be

560
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,760
able to glance at a wearable armband

561
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,080
that could give them insights as to if

562
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,520
they need to relocate

563
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,280
their trap this enables them to make the

564
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,440
best of a short duration fishing season

565
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,760
and the reason why fishing seasons are

566
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,480
short

567
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,960
is to protect animal migration from

568
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,159
getting caught in the

569
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,440
long lines in the vertical lines

570
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,480
so how might this be possible there are

571
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,880
numerous approaches one approach could

572
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,039
be using computer vision

573
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,280
other approaches could be using a

574
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,000
variety of sensors

575
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,840
the best part is that the monitor would

576
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,280
be able to be standalone

577
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,080
within the trap or integrate into

578
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,280
existing systems

579
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,840
here's the path to how we will implement

580
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,039
the monitor

581
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,400
the key part is making sure that the

582
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,600
training process is adaptable and can be

583
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:21,919
done

584
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,280
quickly the reason why this is key

585
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,720
is because when we want to deploy this

586
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,120
in

587
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,720
different locations where there's

588
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,799
different species we will need to make

589
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,400
sure that this process

590
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,520
can be fast we can start

591
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,559
using start with a rubber duck even

592
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,760
just to make sure that the process

593
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,120
we have it fine tuned after the monitor

594
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,360
is

595
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,840
operational we can also experiment with

596
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,080
underwater illumination

597
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,480
then heading into field testing the

598
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,240
detection

599
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,000
possibly developing the wearable aspect

600
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,640
leading to initial fishing of with the

601
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,919
tester

602
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,679
this will then provide us the key

603
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,520
feedback that we need to

604
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,880
make refinements with

605
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,840
and then document it so that this way

606
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,240
the

607
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,760
open source project can be best utilized

608
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,640
by the fishers

609
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,440
so thank you so much for your time and

610
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,880
your attention

611
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,000
and i would love to hear the feedback

612
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,559
from

613
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,880
conservationx labs now and i'll pass it

614
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,080
back to magenta

615
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,720
thank you so much aaron tobia and leo

616
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,919
for the presentation

617
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,600
it's exciting to see the concepts that

618
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,200
you guys have started to develop here

619
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,919
and i'm sure

620
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,360
sam has a lot of ideas and insight to

621
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,919
what you've got here i want to remind

622
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,000
the audience to please comment any

623
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
questions we're going to be

624
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,159
doing a 10 minute q a at the end here so

625
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,960
be sure to keep

626
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,840
commenting

627
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,480
sorry about that and uh without further

628
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,400
ado we'll pass it off to sam for some

629
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,880
feedback

630
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,799
this is fantastic i'm super excited

631
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,320
about what you guys have come up with

632
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,159
um i think it addresses a lot of the

633
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,520
issues we're talking about

634
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,880
obviously this is you know a

635
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
conservation issue it's a pollution

636
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,120
issue

637
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,640
it's an economics issue sorry to

638
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
interrupt sam just a moment

639
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,720
can uh can one of you stop sharing your

640
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,919
screen for the presentation

641
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,840
just a moment here we'll be all caught

642
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
up

643
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,320
go ahead sam yeah so as i'm saying this

644
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,840
is i think it's fantastic what you guys

645
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,880
have come up with i think

646
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,720
it addresses a lot of the issues i was

647
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,120
hoping and like you said giovanni at the

648
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,080
start um

649
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,000
i believe i mean this is such a big

650
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,159
problem that it's kind of hard to like

651
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,520
address it all and i think

652
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,600
what you all have done by selecting the

653
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,640
um

654
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,799
the vertical line fisheries is a good

655
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,480
move particularly for the reasons you

656
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,360
spoke about

657
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,400
um because it obviously is an issue

658
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,120
for ghost scare uh sounds like catch

659
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,640
efficiency after the fact

660
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,400
um i think that's a really really good

661
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
choice um

662
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,480
i was uh curious on a couple of things i

663
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,600
mean

664
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,520
there's obviously uh three or four

665
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,760
concepts within this one within this one

666
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,600
proposed solution is there a particular

667
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,799
aspect of the

668
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,440
uh of this of the proposed solution you

669
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
all think

670
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,880
is the most important or or do they do

671
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,000
you think they all

672
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,960
feed into each other

673
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,960
yeah that's a great question i can

674
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
take a little bit of that so as you

675
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,480
mentioned they do

676
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,679
sort of feed into each other and a lot

677
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,600
of the pieces are dependent

678
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,840
on each other to make a system as the

679
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
whole

680
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,559
the monitor as we mentioned can exist

681
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,400
standalone

682
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,440
for more info about the ropeless aspect

683
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:19,760
though

684
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,799
i'll pass it to leo

685
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,880
yeah um yeah it's true what you said

686
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,080
uh because of the specific design of

687
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,960
applying aerobics or developing a roblox

688
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,919
system

689
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,120
uh the roblox is very important because

690
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,240
the uh it has to it is one of the most

691
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,559
important parts because it has to

692
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,200
work very well but for them or else it

693
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,960
creates the same problem that it tries

694
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,919
to avoid

695
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,840
if it doesn't release the buoy then

696
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,240
decisions can even have a visual

697
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,679
uh idea uh a norwegian

698
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,480
and some signal with a with a new

699
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,840
location on the top

700
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,640
so i would say in the case of just

701
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,600
thinking about

702
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,080
the roblox aromatics vital is very

703
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,799
important

704
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,279
and after that once they are very sure

705
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:11,840
that the

706
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,799
buoy can be released correctly and can

707
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,840
go to a service

708
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,320
after that we of course have the gps and

709
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,039
the means

710
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,279
for them to do because they normally

711
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,520
have to they will have the visual image

712
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,120
of the bully but if they are not close

713
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,399
enough they will need

714
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,880
uh information and the transmission of

715
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,520
the information

716
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,200
fantastic yeah i i agree i think the

717
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,960
ropeless aspect is obviously really

718
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,559
important and i would love to see

719
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,080
the whole solution together i think

720
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,440
that's what you what you all the

721
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,600
shooting for is is fantastic

722
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,159
um i'm curious one thing that did come

723
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,000
up i think you mentioned briefly at the

724
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,520
start of your presentation but

725
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,010
perhaps wasn't explicitly stated um

726
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,200
[Music]

727
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,480
fishers often are not necessarily

728
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,559
uh don't necessarily have a budget set

729
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,559
aside to upgrade their gear and as a

730
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,320
result often

731
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,640
a little suspicious of or or or not

732
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,399
willing perhaps to try out new

733
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,600
technologies

734
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,000
um was there a price point or any way

735
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,840
you were perhaps trying to address

736
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,159
or or thought about addressing um that

737
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:12,960
concern

738
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,279
that that maybe feeds in as a constraint

739
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,480
that's a really great point sam what we

740
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:20,960
found

741
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,000
in our research is that

742
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,480
that's where legislation plays a key

743
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,600
role

744
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,960
for example if

745
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,200
next time fishers have to upgrade their

746
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
gear and they also have to

747
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,840
purchase alongside of it a piece of

748
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,200
technology

749
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,840
that's one way to make this change

750
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,279
happen

751
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,000
fantastic and uh i mean i i'm i'm aware

752
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,880
of uh

753
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
i think the united states has some um

754
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,559
interesting legislation coming into

755
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,120
force

756
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,200
start of next year around specifically

757
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,039
marine mammal by catch and so

758
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,960
this technology may be able to feed into

759
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,480
something like that um

760
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,760
that that's fantastic um

761
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
i was curious just to get into some of

762
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,360
the technology a little bit uh if you

763
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,080
don't mind

764
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,320
um and and perhaps how you were planning

765
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,240
on executing this um

766
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,559
specifically on the ropeless fishing um

767
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,919
a lot of the

768
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,080
the issues with current robles ripless

769
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,919
fishing prototypes is that

770
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,840
um it gets relatively expansive

771
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,360
relatively quickly

772
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,039
because of the underwater acoustic

773
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,440
communication um i just was wondering if

774
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:27,919
you could

775
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,039
clarify um how um

776
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,840
you all were planning on um triggering

777
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,039
that release mechanism

778
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,120
and if there was any uh which is a

779
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,240
straight timer or if there's any

780
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,360
communications

781
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,158
involved as well

782
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,600
sure i can talk a bit about the release

783
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,320
mechanism

784
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,080
and then i'll pass it to leo to talk

785
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,320
about more of the sensor

786
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,600
aspect the release mechanism we would

787
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,880
likely go with would be

788
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,399
an active buoyancy engine meaning that

789
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,799
at the surface it would fill itself up

790
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,440
with

791
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,760
it would fill a bladder up with water

792
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,840
that would allow it to descend alongside

793
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,039
of the gear

794
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,000
when it needs to ascend then it would

795
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,559
offset

796
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,159
its weight by dispensing that water

797
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,919
and allowing it to go up

798
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,919
and uh leo uh feel free to chime in and

799
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,520
invest the yeah electronics

800
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,960
yeah in case of electronics uh our first

801
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,600
idea

802
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,840
since we have to reduce cost and we're

803
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,960
also uh trying to i at the most possible

804
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,000
trying to

805
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
have all the electronics inside the

806
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,200
place so if we have

807
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,840
the releasing mechanism and we have uh

808
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,399
the

809
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,559
gps and we have everything we can create

810
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,440
a package with

811
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,559
the release and the microcontroller

812
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,159
the gps and everything at once it's

813
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,000
really this group of uh

814
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,559
boards and electronics surface and also

815
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,919
uh performs

816
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,559
the video sending the signals of course

817
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,159
if we have to if we need

818
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,559
if we had the the possibility to break

819
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,440
it or

820
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,519
to break the design and have different

821
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,600
models in different parts of the trap

822
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,960
uh we'll only go for that route if we

823
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,039
manage to reduce the cost and if we

824
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,039
managed to create an effective means of

825
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,159
communication

826
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,880
uh if not the idea is to have everything

827
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,080
in the same package

828
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,480
so we don't have to communicate through

829
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,200
water

830
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,679
uh that those are our alternatives of

831
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,039
course if we manage to

832
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,000
have a good solution that works and each

833
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,039
level for the future

834
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,919
awesome um along those lines i'm curious

835
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,679
um you obviously um you know

836
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,039
specifically on the still on the

837
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,120
reckless fishing um

838
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,080
if this was to fail without a vertical

839
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,640
line

840
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,679
it obviously ends up becoming ghost gear

841
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,360
is there um any um

842
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,039
were you planning on any fail-safe

843
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,799
mechanism or anything like that

844
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,919
perhaps to to prevent if the electronics

845
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,960
were to fail um any way of of

846
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,840
you know still saving the gear

847
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,799
that's something that we need to

848
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,039
consider further

849
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,080
ways that we could adapt to that

850
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,840
situation would be

851
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,080
with a more mechanical timer so

852
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,480
mechanical and chemical in a way so for

853
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,200
example

854
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,000
if something ends up corroding over time

855
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,880
then it could

856
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,240
release the buoy

857
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,919
oh that's interesting yeah i like that

858
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,760
idea actually um so

859
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,320
i know that in the marine space often um

860
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,720
nichrome wire is used uh it corrodes if

861
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,640
a current goes through it um in salt

862
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,519
water and and

863
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,039
and so they i don't know if there's a

864
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,640
fail safe in some way but

865
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,120
um that that that's that's interesting

866
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,000
um

867
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
fantastic i think like along the line of

868
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,279
fishing stuff i know that there's a lot

869
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,880
of excitement in this area and and i

870
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,600
think you

871
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,159
the the the what you brought up around

872
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,200
legislation is

873
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,279
is very important and i know that that

874
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,320
often

875
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,880
um if there are ways of making this the

876
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,840
fishery safer

877
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
there is uh both government the

878
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,440
governments are often interested

879
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,399
in uh in in those in those solutions and

880
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,200
ropeless gear

881
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,159
is often at the top of that list um

882
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,200
moving on to like

883
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,440
i was really curious uh a little bit

884
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,960
more to hear a little bit more about the

885
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,120
the monetary solution and and perhaps if

886
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,480
you could elaborate a little bit further

887
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,840
what your thinking was there

888
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,320
um so you're talking about monitoring

889
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,039
species

890
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,559
or catch in the uh in the gear itself

891
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,440
and if so um i just wanted to explain

892
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,240
that a little bit further

893
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,279
absolutely so the monitor device

894
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,840
could be something that attaches on to

895
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,880
the modular aspect of the buoy

896
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,720
so it could possibly be standalone or

897
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,600
integrated with our system there are

898
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,760
multiple ways that we've been discussing

899
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,080
to monitor the traffic within

900
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,359
the trap it could be mechanical we could

901
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,199
use a variety of sensors

902
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,239
we could also use computer vision

903
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,760
now toby has experience with computer

904
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,599
vision

905
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,520
uh toby would you uh elaborate on

906
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,639
that yeah thank you erin

907
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,199
so i mean part of the computer vision is

908
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:29,839
just to

909
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,839
kind of create some data sets i mean we

910
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,760
can go into the ocean for now we just

911
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,800
use some

912
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,159
dummy fish to kind of create some data

913
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,918
set and train it

914
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,119
and um we have some different open

915
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:43,599
source

916
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,960
uh training method that could be used

917
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,280
like

918
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,159
open vino uh you can use that for for

919
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,839
computer vision training and you know

920
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,960
you can run all your

921
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,199
real-time computer mission approach on

922
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,320
it so

923
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,079
that's one but we're still trying to

924
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,760
deciding which

925
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,079
specific hardware we should develop that

926
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,400
on there'll be low power

927
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,280
that doesn't require a lot of combined

928
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,320
because i know we can

929
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,640
put that completely on a microprocessor

930
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,760
like a tiny one

931
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,240
do we want to do it on raspberry pi we

932
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,599
don't know like we're still trying to

933
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,800
think about that

934
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,760
they want to do that on looking to squad

935
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,440
it's another development that

936
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,359
allow quick comprehension approach so

937
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,560
that's what we're still trying to figure

938
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,640
out but i think we understand pretty

939
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,200
well

940
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,960
what we want to use the computer vision

941
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,560
to do or we're just trying to think

942
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,359
about

943
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,480
the hardware selection that could be so

944
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,359
fast in in training and getting accurate

945
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,000
results for us

946
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,320
yeah that's fantastic yeah

947
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,880
yeah i i would like to ask that uh

948
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,520
we are very uh we're considering that

949
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,320
it's very

950
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,880
for each part of the electronic

951
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,240
electronic design

952
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,160
we are always considering the power

953
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,760
consumption since we are

954
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,000
always keeping in mind the time that the

955
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,680
trap needs to be underwater

956
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,000
so these uh solutions need to work but

957
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,720
they need to be

958
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,040
well suited for the task because if they

959
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,520
work during an hour or two

960
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,280
it won't be useful at all for the

961
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,800
fishers uh

962
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,839
so therefore the the selection of the

963
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,320
method of course we would like to have

964
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,720
more a mechanical solution or something

965
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,440
that goes

966
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,200
for the rest of sonar or we can have

967
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,400
uh a computer vision but because of it

968
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:34,880
always

969
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,359
keep in mind that the power consumptions

970
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,320
need to be

971
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,119
uh needs to be in in our limits in the

972
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,000
72

973
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,560
it can be it can work on the 72 hour

974
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,280
range or

975
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,320
48 hour range so it has a highly

976
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,400
uh can be highly adaptable for different

977
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,079
type of patients and they have different

978
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,640
stroke times

979
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,760
and of course in addition to leo

980
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,720
part of the batch management design that

981
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,280
we want to put in place is to

982
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,000
uh check different charging status and

983
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,040
also

984
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,359
make all the system go to sleep mode at

985
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,160
some point

986
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,520
so that we can save the battery from

987
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,800
uh just pulling data out pushing data to

988
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,400
the internet so this is a kind of

989
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,839
approach that

990
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,440
you might have to use to just to save

991
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,200
the battery

992
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,280
yeah this is fantastic and i think

993
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,359
um in addition to it being useful for

994
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,960
for fishers uh it is

995
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,320
also invaluable to uh to researchers

996
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,760
uh scientific researchers but also

997
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,200
governments i think you know

998
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,079
understanding

999
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,760
you know whether these these fisheries

1000
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,280
are sustainable um

1001
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,640
in some ways if there is if there are

1002
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,800
ways of aggregating that data that that

1003
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,720
would be hugely valuable

1004
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
um i'm curious though along those lines

1005
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,119
you obviously um

1006
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,240
going to collect all this computer

1007
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
vision data or other ways of monitoring

1008
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,720
this

1009
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,839
these traps that kind of data um that i

1010
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,359
presume you were talking about

1011
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,280
feeding that into the wearable in some

1012
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,040
way and and i wasn't

1013
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,320
100 clear how that worked and and what

1014
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,520
the goal was there

1015
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,160
um i i presume in some ways it's going

1016
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,720
to

1017
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,200
be uh allow the fisher to make a

1018
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,960
decision in some way that changes the

1019
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,160
practice in some way

1020
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,599
um perhaps you could elaborate on that

1021
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,880
absolutely the idea behind the wearable

1022
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,920
would be to allow the fisher to

1023
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,560
interpret

1024
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,280
some of the data at a quick glance

1025
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,000
rather than

1026
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,280
say um when their hands are full and

1027
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,880
they're trying to also grab their

1028
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,079
smartphone

1029
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,359
to like look more in depth at the data

1030
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,079
this wearable could say on the wrist

1031
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:42,560
like

1032
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,760
number of fish seen in the chat number

1033
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,800
of fish seen

1034
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,280
around the trap and then perhaps have an

1035
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,480
indicator

1036
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,760
um divided by the number of hours

1037
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,440
in a day to show where the peaks were

1038
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,839
this is mainly so that during the

1039
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,280
process of when they're like

1040
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,680
retrieving the traps and like their

1041
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,839
hands are so busy everything is so wet

1042
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,440
with the ocean water

1043
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,280
they can't really like grab their

1044
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,720
smartphone unless

1045
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,119
they are have it protected in some way

1046
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,800
against the elements

1047
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,320
um and so it's an easy way for them to

1048
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,359
receive the data

1049
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,000
yeah i i really like that idea and i

1050
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,599
think that plays into another question i

1051
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,079
had

1052
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,839
um and i'm sure this was brought up in

1053
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,200
interviews as well

1054
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,640
um and i mean it obviously depends on

1055
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,000
which fishery you're targeting which

1056
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,960
country you are

1057
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,760
are living in or or you're deploying in

1058
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,839
um

1059
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,000
how in terms of accessibility um and to

1060
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
the technology needed for the solution

1061
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
obviously smartphones are you know

1062
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,599
relatively ubiquitous around the world

1063
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,040
these days but

1064
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,000
on boats i presume it's not always the

1065
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,760
case to have a smartphone available was

1066
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,000
there

1067
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,280
any thought as to um

1068
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,040
how how we could get around that issue

1069
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,520
in any way

1070
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,599
perhaps on the shipboard computer or

1071
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,200
something like that um

1072
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,400
i'm just curious uh if um if there was

1073
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:10,800
any

1074
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,640
if during interviews there was if that

1075
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,400
was brought up as smartphones being a

1076
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,319
good a good platform to

1077
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,000
put the solution that's a great question

1078
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,920
we will have to dive into that a bit

1079
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,040
further

1080
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,960
but one thing that did come up in our

1081
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,880
interviews is that

1082
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,359
at least for canada they're going to be

1083
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,680
integrating in

1084
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,119
specific ghost gear location buttons

1085
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,720
on their vms so perhaps there is a way

1086
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,640
to integrate with that

1087
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,118
and we can explore that further too

1088
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
yeah that sounds interesting i mean yeah

1089
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,800
i i think there are there's a number of

1090
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,920
ways to go about doing this and

1091
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,119
obviously smartphones are

1092
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,200
you know everyone already has one for

1093
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,720
the most part or has

1094
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,040
has the ability to access one in some

1095
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,760
way

1096
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,119
um but obviously this is a pretty

1097
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,760
extreme environment in some ways it may

1098
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,440
be an issue and especially in cold

1099
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,960
weather environments

1100
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,000
um interesting that's that's great

1101
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,480
um and then just finally um you

1102
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,359
obviously

1103
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,280
you did the the solution mapping and one

1104
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,800
of the big things you talked about and

1105
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,560
there were quite a few solutions in the

1106
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,520
space was

1107
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,000
uh gear uh gear location tracking

1108
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,280
um and there was a number of different

1109
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,280
communications uh

1110
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,640
uh options that you'd mentioned um was

1111
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,599
there any thought

1112
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,480
as to whether you're going on gsm or

1113
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,000
satellite communication or

1114
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,280
vhf because obviously those change the

1115
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,560
types of data you can transmit

1116
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,560
and how far yeah

1117
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,960
we have we have been comparing different

1118
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,000
solutions that we

1119
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,839
have and maybe uh now we can

1120
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,319
talk a little bit more about a specific

1121
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,000
solution but we have been like

1122
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,040
comparing for example uh

1123
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,160
radio from some radio boards also

1124
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,119
laura that is that is also used so very

1125
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,480
commonly used in the

1126
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,280
in the field of the electronics maybe so

1127
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,760
we can expand a little bit more about it

1128
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,040
uh and it's uh it's a situation where we

1129
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,480
have to compare

1130
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,119
range we need we need to compare range

1131
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,319
and we also need to compare

1132
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,599
costs uh that is a very different that's

1133
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,319
uh

1134
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,760
two things that we need to keep in mind

1135
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,880
when we are selecting there are

1136
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,680
different amounts

1137
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,359
where there are alternatives that give

1138
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,880
us of course a very high

1139
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,640
range maybe a connection to uh irritable

1140
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,480
satellites and we will have

1141
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,400
communications all the time but it can

1142
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,119
be highly

1143
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,000
expensive and we can have laura laura

1144
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,800
this was like

1145
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,280
one kilometer range and we can have

1146
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,480
several beacons from

1147
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,000
a connector uh toby if you want to

1148
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,599
you can expand on this aspect

1149
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,480
yeah i mean about lura specifically

1150
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,680
we trying to see how we can um

1151
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,319
you know laura can literally work under

1152
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,119
water but

1153
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,520
we've researched that it's possible so

1154
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,880
we can now connect

1155
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,119
all these devices together and access

1156
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,079
them through

1157
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,119
one point and that point would fit

1158
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,760
the server or whatever well the lora is

1159
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,680
just creating a network of

1160
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,960
devices uh underwater so those are

1161
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,359
things

1162
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,920
which would reduce cost it's very cheap

1163
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,319
and of course it will also reduce um

1164
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,720
you know we pushing data from each of

1165
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,000
those units

1166
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,880
why not gather everything together and

1167
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,720
access each of the units

1168
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,440
like individually so with that with

1169
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,240
reduce our

1170
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,720
of course it increases time so that's

1171
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,319
the importance of lura

1172
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,040
you know so and we can even go like a

1173
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,079
very long range

1174
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,640
underwater they can still continuously

1175
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
access their devices remotely

1176
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,839
so yeah but of course we still need

1177
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,079
how to still gather the data from laura

1178
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,160
because lola is just creating a network

1179
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,480
of

1180
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,880
connection we see it to access those

1181
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,920
information

1182
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,800
uh remotely through you know gprs

1183
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,400
satellites or other news

1184
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,760
awesome i'm sorry i believe i have a

1185
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,280
couple more minutes i have one last

1186
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,000
question

1187
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,760
um and um that was specifically i mean

1188
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,440
this is something i've had to deal with

1189
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,839
you know with my cxl team as well we're

1190
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,119
obviously all remote and

1191
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,280
and for you for you all you're all you

1192
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,359
know very remote from each other

1193
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,000
uh literally on different continents um

1194
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,079
with hardware development that can

1195
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,680
obviously be a challenge sometimes i was

1196
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,720
just wondering how

1197
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,280
how you all were approaching um the

1198
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,079
development

1199
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,960
um of these different subsystems um just

1200
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,560
out of curiosity um

1201
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,319
how you were planning on tackling that

1202
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,839
that issue

1203
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,119
we did discuss it because it is a big

1204
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,200
question

1205
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,560
we had the approach

1206
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,400
um that will do parallel development

1207
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,599
so making what each of us have been

1208
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,359
developing in our own

1209
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,400
location we'll have to

1210
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,359
see how well that works when we really

1211
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,440
start prototyping

1212
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,760
at the very end of it though we will be

1213
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,480
shipping

1214
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,000
like to each of us at an entire

1215
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,839
unit so that way we can keep it and show

1216
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:28,800
it to

1217
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,400
other fishers

1218
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,920
fantastic yeah it's uh a problem i think

1219
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,920
even even people within the same offices

1220
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,280
are now starting to face and it's

1221
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,280
something that i've i've uh

1222
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,800
i still haven't found a good answer so

1223
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,400
i'd love to if you if you you will

1224
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,720
figure it out um

1225
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,680
i'm really curious um this is fantastic

1226
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,160
i mean

1227
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,720
um i'd love to hear you know perhaps who

1228
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,240
else if there's any questions from other

1229
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:54,720
people

1230
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,200
um i think there are some other ones i

1231
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,359
have as well but i'm happy to turn it

1232
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,839
over

1233
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,839
yeah we have a few questions from the

1234
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,760
audience that we'll um

1235
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,440
address and then if we have a few extra

1236
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,880
minutes at the end sam we can come back

1237
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,480
to you if that sounds good

1238
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,040
thank you for the feedback and insight

1239
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,000
and i think

1240
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,960
yes the um the whole remote prototyping

1241
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,760
conundrum

1242
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,920
is something that everyone probably is

1243
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,200
looking for answers for

1244
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,839
so we'll definitely i'm sure be logging

1245
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,920
that in their logs our dream team

1246
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,720
and keep everyone updated there and i

1247
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,280
think

1248
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,680
just the broader yeah hacker community

1249
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,119
engineering community

1250
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,800
um probably has all kinds of ideas

1251
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,240
around that all right

1252
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,720
so uh thank you so much to our audience

1253
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,119
for the following questions

1254
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,119
um let's dive in here so

1255
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,040
um i believe you started to cover this

1256
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:49,920
but maybe

1257
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,119
um maybe this person was late to the

1258
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,760
to the um the show so just maybe you can

1259
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,720
elaborate

1260
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,960
can the measured fishing effort be used

1261
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,720
to map and predict the catch in future

1262
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,560
deployment thus reducing the overall

1263
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,400
effort by avoiding non-productive

1264
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,720
sites

1265
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,680
yes that would be the ideal case

1266
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,720
if we're able to understand uh the

1267
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,839
behavior better

1268
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,560
then we can position the traps better

1269
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,880
and that not only goes for the fish that

1270
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,079
we would want to catch

1271
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,079
but also the fish we would want to avoid

1272
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,520
catching as bycatch

1273
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,559
yes yeah

1274
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,240
that's one of the key aspects that we

1275
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,599
are trying to uh

1276
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,839
that laser part of our concept because

1277
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,520
we are not only measuring

1278
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,440
the specific positions that we're using

1279
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,200
that the fissures are using to perform

1280
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,480
the cash we're also

1281
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,640
measuring the efficiency so the

1282
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,240
combining that they will have reliable

1283
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,400
data specifically for that to avoid

1284
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,440
non-productive places uh and have

1285
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,319
that like measurable data for them so

1286
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:56,720
this

1287
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,400
that's more part of the data breathing

1288
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,240
approach that we're trying that we're

1289
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,160
importing as we're talking

1290
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,920
and hopefully that'll motivate and

1291
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,839
encourage um

1292
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,000
adapting to the system right i think

1293
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,359
that's a good

1294
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:16,078
advantage to it all right um

1295
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,160
one person commented i think the most

1296
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,920
important part is closing the trap how

1297
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,839
will you proceed to detect the amount of

1298
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,839
fish and open and close the mechanism to

1299
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:24,480
avoid

1300
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,640
malfunctioning i think you also covered

1301
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,760
this a little bit but maybe you could

1302
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,359
reiterate

1303
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,200
your ideas there sure

1304
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,880
the trap that we're ideally going to be

1305
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,920
focusing on

1306
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,760
is a lobster trap the way lobsters

1307
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,040
enter it is through a funnel of

1308
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,680
netting and then they go eat some bait

1309
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,200
and then they

1310
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,359
transfer over into another room and once

1311
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,440
they go into the other room it's

1312
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,920
very difficult for them to escape unless

1313
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,119
they're

1314
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,200
under a certain size with regards to

1315
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,040
perhaps your question was referring to

1316
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,680
the

1317
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,680
unlocking mechanism or the release

1318
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,040
mechanism of the

1319
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,119
buoy uh there are multiple ways of going

1320
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,319
about it

1321
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,839
we were originally thinking about an

1322
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,400
active buoyancy engine

1323
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,359
if that is too complicated we could go

1324
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,359
with a magnetically coupled

1325
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:27,680
uh twist lock and unleash its buoyancy

1326
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,559
that way

1327
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,599
uh in the case uh in the case that

1328
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,599
question is related to a specific

1329
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,359
entry of the trust uh it's uh

1330
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,559
it's an interesting idea that it also it

1331
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,720
came up in our research

1332
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,119
that it can be an awful solution we

1333
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,880
really didn't add it to the

1334
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,880
specifics of the of the design but

1335
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,280
either talking about closing the entry

1336
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,520
of the travel once it becomes gold here

1337
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,640
we are we are tackling the concept in a

1338
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,280
different

1339
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,680
uh in a different manner about like uh

1340
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,960
retrieving the

1341
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,880
the gear but that could be an

1342
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:13,280
interesting idea and it is

1343
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,800
uh where to place uh the device in order

1344
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,280
that

1345
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,280
if it becomes goes here it can close the

1346
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,720
entry because

1347
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,000
if anything uh if you want to say that

1348
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,680
you do

1349
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,079
are sure that you are built here and you

1350
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,880
can close the entry of the trap

1351
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,960
it's an interesting idea to keep in mind

1352
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,720
thank you leo and aaron all right um

1353
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,280
next question have you all considered

1354
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,319
um involving a program in open

1355
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:45,760
i'm not sure if this pronounced open

1356
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,599
word or open wrt

1357
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,920
which can detect phishing pages on local

1358
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,839
wi-fi spots

1359
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,280
if not maybe it's a great suggestion

1360
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,119
i think it's a suggestion open w out

1361
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,119
seats for wi-fi so

1362
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:09,599
uh it's like uh like um operating system

1363
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,839
that would like you can reprogram some

1364
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:12,720
wi-fi

1365
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,960
devices to have your own specific

1366
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,880
frequency to operate on

1367
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,079
which it's an idea and that's why we are

1368
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,640
still considering using dora neural will

1369
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,720
give us our own specific frequency

1370
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,640
from the development stage we don't have

1371
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,920
to

1372
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,960
write additional operating system like

1373
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,640
uh open wrt colora we can select a

1374
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,440
frequency

1375
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,319
872 or a36 so depending of that

1376
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:38,960
frequency

1377
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,119
and we can operate on that frequency to

1378
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,000
send data

1379
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,559
delete data to request and do anything

1380
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,280
we want to do

1381
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,599
so yeah thanks toby all right and lastly

1382
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,800
um someone brought up uh if you guys

1383
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,319
have started to

1384
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,319
deal with the low visibility when

1385
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,359
training um

1386
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,200
computer vision uh for fish detection

1387
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,960
underwater

1388
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,800
have you considered how you're going to

1389
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,520
work with that

1390
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,359
that's a really great question it's

1391
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:14,720
something we're going to have to

1392
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,680
experiment

1393
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,960
with in the field

1394
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,040
we also may have some insights on it too

1395
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,640
yeah uh i've i have also worked

1396
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,160
in computer vision and i i did

1397
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,520
not for underwear applications but

1398
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,559
the intensity the of the light is always

1399
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,640
a problem that you need to keep in mind

1400
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,240
because there is too much of because

1401
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,160
there is a lack of intensity

1402
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,040
so in this case it's going to be a

1403
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,760
problem

1404
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,880
we are uh of course uh we are in uh

1405
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,079
early stage in the concept design so we

1406
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,800
right now we don't have tests that uh

1407
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,880
that prove the amount of intensity that

1408
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,680
that that we are going to have in the

1409
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,440
situation or in the skill

1410
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,079
so like aaron said we need to do more

1411
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:04,880
tests

1412
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,119
but in the in the early stages as we are

1413
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,800
right now this is the thing that we need

1414
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,280
to

1415
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,440
do to

1416
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,760
available solution or maybe to rule out

1417
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,040
completely the solution

1418
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,640
and not rule out but change the approach

1419
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,359
for the

1420
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,480
monetary capacity

1421
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,800
and leo i would like to add to that or

1422
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,680
add a question to it would would motion

1423
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,200
sensors

1424
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,240
combined with with this help

1425
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,400
to you know try to have an idea a rough

1426
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,400
idea of how many

1427
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,240
lobsters you have in the trap

1428
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,800
yeah well to say it's root

1429
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,920
we will have to test you probably going

1430
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,880
to be a

1431
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,079
situation about really performing

1432
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,280
several tasks

1433
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,480
several tests because uh the amount of

1434
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,200
noise and that we need to measure how

1435
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,880
our recommendations in the environment

1436
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,319
that we're working on

1437
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,520
we really have thought about thinking on

1438
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,720
adapting more like sonars or using

1439
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,040
of course computation or some mechanical

1440
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,000
idea like

1441
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,599
combination but uh yeah we can test like

1442
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,400
motion sensors and see if they if we can

1443
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:28,960
uh

1444
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,359
work with the noise uh and maybe i make

1445
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,280
it like well suited for the environment

1446
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:33,680
that

1447
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,280
uh it's it's going to work

1448
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,839
got it thanks

1449
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,480
thank you all right that's all for our

1450
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,000
audience questions sam

1451
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,240
if you want to ask one last question and

1452
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,119
then we'll wrap it up

1453
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,319
the pressure the last question um yeah i

1454
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:52,640
think

1455
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,559
i mean i think that one the one last

1456
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,240
question i have is regarding

1457
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,880
um obviously the core issue with this

1458
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,359
whole

1459
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:00,880
what we're trying to address here is

1460
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,640
reducing the amount of gear that's lost

1461
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,599
in the ocean

1462
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,520
plastic and for by catch reasons um

1463
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,720
would you is there any way perhaps that

1464
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,359
the use of this computer vision or other

1465
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,319
way of detecting

1466
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:18,000
fish or other species in the trap

1467
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,520
could allow for reduction in in

1468
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,920
uh the amount of we call soap time so

1469
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,559
perhaps

1470
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,520
um reducing the amount of time and spent

1471
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,319
at the bottom by

1472
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,599
alerting the fisher that there is um

1473
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:32,880
fish in the trap is that something that

1474
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,839
has been considered

1475
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,000
yeah it's possible that this could

1476
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,520
happen

1477
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,839
one of the surprising things we found

1478
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,319
when we did discuss with fishers

1479
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,000
is that some for some types of traps

1480
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,960
they actually

1481
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,160
bring it up for re-baiting every day so

1482
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,000
that sort of eliminates the need for if

1483
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,359
something would have to be detecting

1484
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:05,040
the capacity and then unleash it however

1485
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,480
in the examples where the gear is under

1486
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:08,799
for

1487
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,079
even longer say 30 days then

1488
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,799
that would be an amazing thing to be

1489
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,119
able to detect when the gear is full

1490
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,880
and then unleash the buoy

1491
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,440
so the buoy can be unleashed either

1492
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,960
based on the timer

1493
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,839
or perhaps through monitoring the gear

1494
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:30,319
capacity

1495
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:31,839
yeah there's so many i think so many

1496
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,079
potential you know uses of of that kind

1497
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,760
of sensing at the bottom which i haven't

1498
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,880
really seen i mean

1499
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,559
if it's deployed in the wrong location

1500
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,079
on rocks where it's potentially going to

1501
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:40,400
be

1502
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,559
you know caught or snagged there's some

1503
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:43,599
really interesting

1504
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:44,799
potential applications i'm really

1505
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,480
excited to work with you guys further on

1506
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:46,799
this

1507
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,160
i think there's some really cool cool

1508
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,720
stuff going on

1509
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,880
thank you so much we're just about out

1510
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,839
of time

1511
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,160
um so we'll have to wrap it up i'm sorry

1512
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:58,960
to have to

1513
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,160
cut the discussion short here um

1514
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,280
thank you so much to our uh partner sam
