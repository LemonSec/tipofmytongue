[Music]

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,300
thank you

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,279
how many people in the room have a ham

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,940
radio license

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,619
pretty good pretty good showing kind of

6
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:23,939
what I'd expect

7
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,680
how many of you that don't have ham

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,960
radio licenses know what ham radio is

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,380
okay

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,059
so

11
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,020
um

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,079
I'm going to talk to you about the ardc

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,500
and its Grant making process

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,879
also at the end we'll be talking about

15
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,920
some of the things that we're working on

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,300
this year my compatriot here John is the

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,980
head of our technical committee so you

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,079
can grab him if that interests you but

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,140
I'm going to talk to you about grants

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,079
Okay so

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,020
you can read this but so can I uh the

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,399
mission of amateur radio digital

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,159
Communications is to support promote and

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,780
enhance digital communication and

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,640
broader communication science

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,860
and Technology to promote having to

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,180
radio scientific research

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,040
experimentation education development

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,560
Open Access and Innovation and

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,320
information Communications technology

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,140
it's a mouthful

32
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,900
basically we're promoting ham radio and

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,140
also certain uh forms of digital

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,540
communication

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,619
um

36
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,740
we're a 501c3 that's a non-profit

37
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,740
foundation in the U.S

38
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,159
um 501c3 has some different categories

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,680
of foundation is

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
tightly managed and doesn't necessarily

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,680
reach out for funding for multiple

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,479
sources

43
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,259
um

44
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,479
and we have to operate under a certain

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,759
set of rules and we'll get into that a

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,720
little bit

47
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,399
we have an endowment which we can

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,680
distribute approximately five to six

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,140
million dollars a year out of in fact we

50
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,580
have to

51
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,679
give out a certain amount of money each

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,080
year because we're a foundation

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,780
and uh

54
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,360
so we don't say how much is in that

55
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,879
endowment but we have to give away five

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,620
percent a year

57
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,980
uh so all the mathematicians in the room

58
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,760
know that we're somewhere around

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,620
that about 20 times that amount

60
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,720
that endowment was created because back

61
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,099
in the early 1980s packet radio was a

62
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,459
thing a a new thing and a gentleman

63
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,800
named Hank magnuske who actually still

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,340
is a volunteer for ardc uh went to John

65
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,560
postel anyone here hear of John Postell

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,340
before

67
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,560
he was the god of Internet addresses

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,620
back then you'd go to him and say I'm

69
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,080
IBM I need some IP addresses and he'd

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,720
give you 16 million of them okay it's

71
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,959
called a Class A Network so Hank went to

72
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,120
John and said hey could we set aside for

73
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,120
amateur radio some addresses and Johnson

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,760
sure here's a Class A 16 million

75
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,899
addresses well

76
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,659
that's a lot of addresses and

77
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,780
a few years ago well a little bit of the

78
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,220
history there

79
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,260
um

80
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,019
it was passed down the the stewardship

81
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,760
of those addresses through a series of

82
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,700
individuals and then about 10 12 years

83
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,280
ago ardc was formed to be the steward of

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,480
the address space because

85
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,980
unfortunately some of us die over time

86
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,280
and so it's good to have a foundation

87
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,099
there that that carries that on

88
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,299
and then

89
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,959
in 2019 we took the step and said hey

90
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,720
we're not using 16 million addresses for

91
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,159
amateur radio uh maybe we could sell

92
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,680
some of them so we sold 4 million of

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,439
those addresses again to a company that

94
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,560
I cannot tell you who it is because the

95
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,780
contracts say that but if you go check

96
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,959
out our 990 tax filing you can find out

97
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,160
who it is so uh anyway uh they bought

98
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,000
them and they paid a market price for

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,560
them at the time

100
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,020
the market price has gone up since then

101
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,580
we could have gotten a lot more money

102
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,520
holding on for a few more uh years but

103
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,960
uh

104
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,280
so given that we have this bank money

105
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,080
that we need to give away and we want to

106
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,400
find people to give it away to and

107
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
that's my job is to find people to give

108
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,259
money to it's a tough job

109
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,259
I've spent 42 calendar days this year

110
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,320
going out meeting with groups like this

111
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,060
to educate them on how they get their

112
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,040
hands on that money there are some

113
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,419
qualifications

114
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,020
uh we also do not actively do

115
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,360
fundraising we've we've got this

116
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,220
endowment we operate out of that

117
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,380
endowment

118
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,979
um

119
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,500
however we you know if someone wanted to

120
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,000
be Quest somebody or something like that

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,100
we have a way to do that but we don't

122
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,620
actively go out and fundraise

123
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,419
um we don't have members there's no

124
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,539
membership to ardc we we operate as a

125
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,520
foundation we have a very small staff

126
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,259
there's six of us John's our newest hire

127
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,660
we're a california-based foundation we

128
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,000
had no california-based employees so we

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,280
had to hire John because he lives here

130
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,600
in California I live up near Seattle

131
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,320
our main website is

132
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,100
www.ampr.org anyone know why it's ampr

133
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,460
yep that's where it comes from

134
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,080
um

135
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,100
and we have a board of uh uh volunteers

136
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,620
uh they're all very senior very

137
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,740
experienced people like Phil Karn and

138
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,500
John Gilmore who you may have heard of

139
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,820
Casey who's an academic at UCSD and and

140
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,759
some others and they do an excellent job

141
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,139
as a bunch of volunteers

142
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,759
so we have some requirements if we're

143
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,500
going to give you money and most of

144
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,319
these are governed by law so that's what

145
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,460
we do so there are

146
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,960
three basic groups that we can give

147
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,180
money to

148
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,240
501c3 uh non-profits those could be

149
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Charities or other foundations and so on

150
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,280
or their International equivalents

151
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,560
because we are an international

152
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,539
organization we make grants

153
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,280
internationally

154
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,819
um

155
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,620
there's some complexity to doing

156
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,300
International but we're willing to do

157
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,840
that if you happen to be International

158
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,860
um and you apply and we accept you we

159
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,360
have to go through something called an

160
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,400
equivalency determination where a bunch

161
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,740
of lawyers look over your documents and

162
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,500
the laws from your country

163
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,500
to make sure you're equivalent to a U.S

164
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,740
501c3 we pay for that if if we pick you

165
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,020
so you don't have to come up with the

166
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,840
processing fees non-profit educational

167
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,780
organizations universities schools so on

168
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,840
we can do that governments sponsored

169
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,419
projects that align with our goals we

170
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,280
can give money to the government I've

171
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,599
never known a government to turn away

172
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:31,819
money

173
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,500
actually they do because there's some

174
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,340
reporting responsibilities and that also

175
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,880
includes tribes the tribal governments

176
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,120
we've done a few grants into tribes

177
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,199
um

178
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,960
so

179
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,720
if you are like in many cases you have

180
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,120
an informal group that is an amateur

181
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,300
radio club that hasn't become a 501c3

182
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,740
you you can go to

183
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,280
an existing 501c3 and have them fiscally

184
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,560
sponsor you

185
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,360
um if they're also a foundation it's

186
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,340
tougher they fall under the same rules

187
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,099
we are if they're a charity or an

188
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,680
educational institution then they can

189
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,199
sponsor you and they can handle the

190
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,680
money and and hand it out to you as

191
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,280
needed we do allow a small amount of

192
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,080
money less than 20 percent of the value

193
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,259
of the grant for someone providing that

194
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,958
service to you

195
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,458
there are also independent organizations

196
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,820
one based here in California called open

197
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,159
Collective you can go to them and apply

198
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,200
if they accept you then they will be

199
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,600
your fiscal sponsor and they take a a

200
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,700
nominal fee of like eight percent or ten

201
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,260
percent uh on top of and we're okay with

202
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,500
that

203
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,300
all righty whoops did I bounce ahead

204
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,959
okay so we have a few categories that

205
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,839
like to fund

206
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,880
support and growth of amateur radio kind

207
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,800
of what you would expect for it if

208
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,160
you've got a project that will add to

209
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,899
the growth of amateur radio whether

210
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,640
that's

211
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,200
teaching classes or building out some

212
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,420
infrastructure we've done a few

213
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,060
microwave IP networks that are

214
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,120
specifically for amateur radio some

215
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,279
other things I mean one of the the

216
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,740
things that we have is we still have

217
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,580
addresses that we can hand out which are

218
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,459
fully routable IP addresses so you know

219
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:42,360
you can

220
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,839
talk to them from the internet and so on

221
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,700
community outreach things support type

222
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,980
infrastructure some emergency

223
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,920
communications projects we seem to have

224
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,839
a whole bunch of people that thinks it's

225
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,959
really cool to buy a trailer and put

226
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,120
some equipment in it and let it sit 360

227
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,420
days of the year when we put money in

228
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,680
something we want it to be used and we

229
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,660
may do those but you better come to with

230
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,540
the plan of how you're going to do more

231
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,080
than let it sit park somewhere

232
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,420
you know you got a regular schedule

233
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,760
going around to schools and exposing

234
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,399
students or other things like that

235
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,399
um

236
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,220
I guess I keep touching the pat here

237
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,620
accidentally okay so education is the

238
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,200
second one we

239
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,440
it's not hard and fast but we

240
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,560
basically give a quarter of that five

241
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,320
million dollars to scholarship funds so

242
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,320
awrl

243
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,180
um we've done the Society of women

244
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,839
Engineers we've done some we're really

245
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,000
interested in increasing the diversity

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,579
in the amateur radio community so we're

247
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,860
really looking for opportunities that

248
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,700
help us do that so we've done some

249
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,959
historically black colleges and

250
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,180
University scholarships and and some

251
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,060
others the scholarships need to be for

252
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,940
STEM related type activities so about a

253
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,399
quarter of the money goes there we also

254
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,899
do for K-12 type projects

255
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,399
um

256
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,720
I don't know that we've done a

257
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,959
fellowship that we consider a fellowship

258
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,220
we've funded

259
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,760
um

260
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,260
a lot of different educational

261
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,640
opportunities out there

262
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,079
research and development this is one

263
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,300
that's near and dear to my heart and we

264
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,800
want to see a lot more of these

265
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,200
collectively which is where you're

266
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,120
extending the art

267
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,959
and this is where the hacker space

268
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,839
Community can really come in we'd be

269
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,480
looking for things like one that we're

270
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,540
funding is called the m17 project which

271
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,899
is a digital voice system that competes

272
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,019
basically with d-star and DMR and and

273
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,240
fusion but it's a hundred percent open

274
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,140
source including the vocoder

275
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,600
and we're funding the development of

276
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,000
that there's some others out there like

277
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,500
that if you have a project that will

278
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,320
advance the art

279
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,380
new applications that might run on uh

280
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,420
digital Communications that kind of

281
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,200
thing that are ham radio related uh

282
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
don't have to be hem radio related but

283
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
they tend to get more of the attention

284
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,860
um

285
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,839
and and we'd just like to see more of

286
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,000
those and that's why I'm here besides

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,959
listening to a bunch of cool

288
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,180
presentations uh one that was

289
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,220
interesting to me earlier was the uh

290
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,459
open source Asic project that they were

291
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,980
talking about nothing I say says you're

292
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,440
going to get approved but we would look

293
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,540
at something like that as long as it was

294
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,700
being done on a non-profits basis and

295
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,480
open source

296
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,300
in fact anything that we fund has to be

297
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,019
open source

298
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,120
okay so to apply for a grant

299
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,060
uh you can apply for Grant anytime

300
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,760
it's done online

301
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,600
we collect them review them and select

302
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,680
grants that we're going to fund four

303
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,880
times a year

304
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,300
the next review period starts February

305
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,860
1st

306
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,200

and February 1st will be in that batch

308
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,820
once it's gone through our internal

309
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,120
process which can take

310
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,320
unfortunately two to four months

311
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,839
sometimes so don't

312
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,760

315
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,480
of thing

316
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,880
um

317
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,700

we'll call you if we need more

320
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,760
information because people say I put in

321
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,920
my application and you know we won't

322
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,720
know until the whole process is done but

323
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,940
we'll notify you as soon as we have a

324
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,800
yes or no for you

325
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,600
and like I say if we have questions

326
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,200
we'll reach out to you so

327
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,079
and the application is done online

328
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:28,800
um

329
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,260
anyone here written a government grant

330
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,540
or an educational grant before

331
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,500
okay you can forget that we're much

332
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,680
more friendly than that

333
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,820
basically there's a couple of ways you

334
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,980
can apply we have a series of questions

335
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,899
in the application you can just fill

336
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,160
those out

337
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,680
the level of detail is probably directly

338
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,660
related to the total amount of the grant

339
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,699
so if you're asking for two thousand

340
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,440
dollars we don't need a big book about

341
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,019
every little detail but if you're asking

342
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,300
for a million and a half we'd like to

343
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,260
understand why uh so

344
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,139
um also the reporting on it is a lot

345
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,500
lighter as well we're not looking for

346
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,720
monthly spreadsheets of how you expended

347
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,120
the funds and stuff uh at the end of the

348
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,279
project you give us a report we said

349
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,060
we'd do this we did this this is we

350
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,220
spent the money you sent us to do these

351
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,980
things uh if your project runs over a

352
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,959
year will last for one at a year and

353
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,939
then again uh later

354
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,139
okay and that's the website

355
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,820
so

356
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,560
um I won't go through everything but

357
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,000
here's some things to think about if

358
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,980
you're going to do a grant request

359
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,620
be sure to re review all the information

360
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,720
on the website first I don't know how

361
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,240
many times I've gotten an email tell me

362
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,940
what the website said you know well go

363
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,440
read it and then come back and ask me

364
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,660
pertinent questions

365
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,560
um

366
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,839
most of our projects are what called

367
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,639
several ready you've already planned it

368
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,320
out you've figured out what you want to

369
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,320
do what your metrics are going to be

370
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,660
um as you do the project and so on

371
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,300
we tend to like one-year projects but if

372
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,920
it's two years it's no big if it's

373
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,279
really long it has to be something

374
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,560
um really significant an example of that

375
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,699
would be uh we gave funds to the heiress

376
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,399
program I think a million and a quarter

377
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,220
or something like that five-year program

378
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,160
we fund up front typically so they got

379
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,380
the money up front

380
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,139
um part of the reason for that

381
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,040
particular formula is uh NASA doesn't

382
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,660
like projects that they don't know where

383
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,060
the fund is going to be so uh the

384
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,459
heiress folks we worked with them and

385
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,160
made that happen but in general we're

386
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,920
looking for uh

387
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,660
let's go

388
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,120
another one is

389
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,819
if you're going to be working with uh

390
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,760
with other groups or facilities and

391
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,760
stuff have it all lined up we've had a

392
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,280
proposal before where oh we're going to

393
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,079
build this great Network and we're going

394
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,020
to put all these uh microwave links on

395
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,880
tops and mountains and they hadn't

396
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,579
negotiated the the sites they knew what

397
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,859
sites they wanted to use but when they

398
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,660
went back there well you know if you got

399
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,400
money we want more money you got nothing

400
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,540
you know so have that all lined up when

401
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,120
you put together your budget include

402
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,720
everything taxes fees any permits that

403
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,160
you need if you're going to need

404
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,960
Professional Services like a tower

405
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,380
climber or an electrician have that all

406
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,760
in the budget right at the beginning

407
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,640
and as I said 20 for indirect costs

408
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,360
um

409
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,580
also the other thing is a lot of times

410
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,500
we have a few hems in the room

411
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,200
they like to be frugal and we like that

412
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
but if we're going to buy equipment

413
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,700
to support

414
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,120
a program we want it to last a while so

415
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,860
we'd rather spend

416
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,840
say three thousand dollars for a new

417
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,480
repeater then you get Fred to give you

418
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,520
his 20 year old repeater for 900 so

419
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,380
find good functional equipment but don't

420
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,720
gold plate it you know don't buy the

421
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,160
nine thousand dollar repeater because

422
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,840
your buddy gets a good commission off of

423
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,919
it

424
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:32,820
um

425
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,640
and have a project plan again the detail

426
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,340
of that project plan is to probably more

427
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,340
directly related to the size of the

428
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,919
projects you're working on and and the

429
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,380
cost of that

430
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
foreign

431
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,140
really make your project stand out when

432
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,299
we first started when I had that chart

433
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,100
of money we gave you the first year you

434
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,140
saw 9 million instead of five we were

435
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,580
doing some catch up

436
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,220
and so basically if you'd applied in

437
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,260
that time frame your chances of getting

438
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,580
it through as long as you met through

439
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,580
quiet went pretty good uh now we're

440
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,299
getting uh well this last quarter just

441
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,120
closed the beginning of October we had

442
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,740
an

443
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,380
total number of applications that

444
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,900
exceeded what we give away a year

445
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,360
and so some aren't going to get approved

446
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,720
obviously

447
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,380
so

448
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,780
provide some previous accomplishments

449
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,940
that you've done so that you know you've

450
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,320
got a little bit of a track record if

451
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
you're a brand new group explain that

452
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,919
but maybe

453
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,539
tell us a little bit about the people

454
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:40,980
that are going to be doing it and some

455
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,900
of their accomplishments

456
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,700
um

457
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,559
we're really big on Outreach and and

458
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,720
building Community around the project

459
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,900
that you're doing uh you do need to

460
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,179
adhere to our uh Open Access and open

461
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,220
source policies and Open Access includes

462
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,080
things like

463
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,760
if you came to us and said we're going

464
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,679
to build this great repeater network and

465
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,480
everybody that's going to use it has to

466
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,360
join our club and pay 200 a year we're

467
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,580
not interested in those projects

468
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,100
there's nothing wrong with soliciting

469
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,200
membership but it shouldn't be a

470
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,640
requirement if we're paying for the

471
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,220
equipment okay

472
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,340
um

473
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:27,000
anything that you're doing that is truly

474
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,520
Innovative tell us about it tell us how

475
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,720
it's innovative

476
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,600
uh but understand what may be Innovative

477
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,220
to you someone else has already done so

478
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,120
um

479
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,100
you know it may be new for your group

480
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,020
you know you just discovered FM okay but

481
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,539
that's not Innovation that's just

482
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,419
it's just getting there uh inclusiveness

483
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:55,500
and Equity are really important are you

484
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,820
reaching out to a broader Community not

485
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,400
everyone looks like me old gray and

486
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,640
ready to kick the bucket uh

487
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,580
use particularly

488
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,480
um

489
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,240
you know fighting the grain of the hobby

490
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,340
we don't need a book but be complete in

491
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,720
your description

492
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,160
uh

493
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,140
also included if you're doing any other

494
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,419
fundraising you know if you come in and

495
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:24,000
you ask us for thirty thousand dollars

496
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,799
and you say but we've also raised ten

497
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,840
thousand on our own that's going to

498
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,880
carry more weight than well just give us

499
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,539
40 000 because you got money right so

500
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,000
um keep those things that's right and

501
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,100
finally a statement of how your project

502
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,980

familiar with

520
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,140
we couldn't do this without a bunch of

521
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,919
volunteers and and we have uh two

522
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,679
standing committees

523
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,320
um and we're recruiting uh

524
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,200
volunteers right now we

525
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,720
we recompose the Committees ever for

526
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,940
each calendar year and so we're at the

527
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,320
end of this calendar year so we're

528
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,059
trying to build up the list

529
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,400
uh if you

530
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,799
apply it are accepted as a volunteer for

531
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,799
one of these committees

532
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,020
you can serve up to three terms and then

533
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,940
you have to step out for at least a year

534
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,220
and what some folks do is they just

535
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,260
switch committees because they really

536
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,360
love what we do so what do the two

537
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,940
committees do well the technical

538
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,520

556
