[Music]

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,839
so our next speaker is a science and

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,180
technology Communicator an electronics

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,060
engineer his talk covers key moments

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,119
over the past two years around what has

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,160
happened happening in the rapidly

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,840
evolving world of Open Source chip

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,800
design

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,019
please welcome to the hackaday supercon

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,339
stage Matt vent

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,600
thank you

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,899
[Applause]

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,460
thanks everyone

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,800
in case I fall over it's just because

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,140
I'm so jet-lagged

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,480
I feel like I'm dreaming

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,940
but it's great to be face to face see

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,140
everybody again

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,760
really excellent to be here so thanks

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,239
for coming yeah the slides uh here and

21
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,280
if Twitter hasn't exploded by the end of

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
the supercon then that's my Twitter

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,059
handle

24
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,680
so

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,760
um

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
Elliot asked if I could just do a quick

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,960
review of what's happened so I'm going

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,360
to run through this review

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,979
um what's happened in the world of Open

30
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,680
Source silicon so in 2020 that's when

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,220
the first open source manufacturable pdk

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,580
was released and the pdk is the database

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,740
that you need to design chips

34
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,700
you also need open source tools as well

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,240
um I ran my VGA clock through the tools

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,600
in July I did a talk for the first

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,799
remote account

38
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,079
and put up a sign up form to see if

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,880
people be interested in a course and it

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,200
was totally Blown Away by the interest

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,619
and I've since had 250 people on the

42
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,780
course which has been amazing

43
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,399
I did my first tip in mpw1 in December

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,659
um mpw2 was in June that was the first

45
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,119
one with my course we got silicon back

46
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,740
from October which we thought was going

47
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,500
to be completely broken

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,520
um

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,560
all these links give more information if

50
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,758
there's something you're more interested

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,420
in we had the next remote account 2021

52
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,819
I was able to get my chip working so

53
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,520
that was my first Asic and it mostly

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,700
worked so that was incredible

55
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,000
um mpw2 Weavers came out of a Fab in

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,040
April but there's been a long wait and

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,220
I've just uh managed to bring up mpw2 in

58
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,020
the in the supercon yesterday so that

59
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,099
was really cool

60
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,819
so

61
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,920
on on that ship we had 16 designs two

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,660
were mined and 14 people from the course

63
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,760
and I've only checked one of my designs

64
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,000
and it mostly works so there's still a

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,459
way to go before this stuff is super

66
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,459
reliable and and more importantly quick

67
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,940
so a tape out should take four or five

68
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,500
months and so far they've been taking

69
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,120
over a year

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,860
so that's good that's got to be

71
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,599
something good to work on

72
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,599
it's a rapidly growing space lots of

73
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,000
people involved

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,660
um

75
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,640
and we've got more pdks coming soon so

76
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,940
we've got the open source Sky 130

77
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,040
uh Global foundries or as I prefer to

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,860
say glowfo glofo 180 this has been

79
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,900
released the first take the first

80
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,700
shuttle Runners

81
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,319
um end of this month

82
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,480
and then next year we've got Sky 90 and

83
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,060
there's going to be a new one by ihp as

84
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,860
well next year

85
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,739
so a little bit of about my first uh

86
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,620
Asics as chip a nice photo from Maximo

87
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,940
balustrini

88
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,400
and we've got a d-cap done by Olivier

89
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,260
it's explained

90
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,480
um and you can see these uh eight

91
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,040
designs

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,840
and the reason that we did eight was

93
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,599
because when I put my VGA clock on I was

94
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,819
like this is Tiny what am I going to do

95
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,680
with the rest of the space Sorry are

96
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,720
some friends and we like made this group

97
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,200
application

98
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,819
um it did have problems uh with hold

99
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,280
time violations and which I'm not going

100
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,080
to get into here but I've written about

101
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,019
that and made a video

102
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,819
um and that was mostly to do with

103
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,680
problems with the tool chain and the the

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,019
top level design

105
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,940
um but my clock works and that's sitting

106
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,680
on my desk telling the time and it's an

107
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,358
accurate time keeper so that's amazing

108
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,759
to have like a design on a chip that's

109
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,160
working if you want to see more of the

110
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,660
other designs working then there's a

111
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,460
link there

112
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,340
so then for the course I worked on

113
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,460
um a system to a more like automated

114
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,380
build system because the first one I did

115
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,060
was basically doing all by hand and it

116
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,620
was terrifying because every time I made

117
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,639
a change

118
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,160
I had to remember what I did to update

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
it and then we had problems I had to

120
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
remember what I did three months ago and

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,500
I was freaking out

122
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,620
so I worked on a kind of a python script

123
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,740
basically that does like an automation

124
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,360
builds the design runs all the tests

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,460
this kind of stuff and

126
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,180
um

127
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,040
this is the

128
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,080
um RGB mixer that's the design I brought

129
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,400
up yesterday I've got a frequency

130
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,259
counter here and then the other designs

131
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,120
are from the people on the course yet to

132
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,660
be checked and they're all connected

133
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,880
um via a Tri-State bus so we have a bit

134
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,040
of firmware you activate the design then

135
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,440
that takes over control of the iOS

136
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
and the other designs are kind of

137
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,620
dormant

138
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,020
so a little bit of a tool overview by

139
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,520
the way this is a real Chip that we

140
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,699
taped out uh with the skull fit

141
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,460
made by URI shakeet of who does walkway

142
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,220
more about him later

143
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,199
so I've got a link here which is a

144
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,320
GitHub repository uh where we people put

145
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,259
um a list of tools that you can use

146
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,780
and we've got a bunch of end-to-end Asic

147
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,060
flow tools

148
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,639
um the OSS CAD Suite from yosys HQ

149
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,520
who's heard of usshq

150
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
good

151
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,440
I work for USS HQ as well

152
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,500
we've got tools for the analog Focus

153
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,419
and we've got loads of stuff that is

154
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,699
missing so there's a huge amount of low

155
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,199
hanging fruit in this space and there's

156
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,000
like loads of room for software

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,199
Engineers to get involved if you're

158
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,820
interested

159
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,479
um

160
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,460
that are going to gradually get filled

161
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,380
in and make the open source ecosystem

162
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,720
better

163
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,060
so some my kind of personal picks of

164
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,039
what was being taped out from mpw one to

165
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,900
seven

166
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,840
um Sylvan minnow TNT did a micro coded

167
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,000
USB peripheral Thomas Perry did a

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,919
satellite five gigahertz satellite

169
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,860
satellite transceiver

170
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,720
um got some analog neural networking

171
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,120
stuff fuse risk that was a dual risk 5

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,699
Core with an fpga Fabric in between

173
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,860
um mpw3 we had an SOC done with Courier

174
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,139
list too that's a different type of um a

175
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,240
tool chain than an open Lane

176
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,699
certain cool analog stuff

177
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,620
we need more of that more analog stuff

178
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,680
to make the digital stuff useful

179
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,039
um there's this goal for it again

180
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,560
radiation tolerance stuff

181
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,620
um a Delta Sigma audio DAC

182
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,660
um a mic the microwave

183
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,280
um

184
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,719
CPU from IBM

185
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,319
um

186
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,000
and this is from the most recent one

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,220
mpw7 is quite an impressive one risk

188
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,840
five and a five gigahertz radio

189
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,039
transceiver

190
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,199
so that'll be super awesome to see if

191
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,720
that works so what you can do digital

192
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,819
stuff easily but then to make it talk to

193
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,599
the real world like HDMI or radio or

194
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,280
these you need these analog blocks and

195
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,080
we still need things like serdis for

196
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,639
doing pcie and this kind of thing

197
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,080
so one thing that's been really cool is

198
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,360
seeing more development of the tools and

199
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,620
especially running the tools in the

200
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,020
cloud so the proprietary tools are never

201
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,880
run in the cloud because you have to

202
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,979
sign an NDA to get them they cost 100

203
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,180
Grand a year

204
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,580
they're very closely guarded and kept

205
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,340
secret and people don't really know what

206
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,720
you can do if you run them in the cloud

207
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,300
and property from Google's done a lot of

208
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,680
devrel stuff

209
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,599
and made it so you can run the tools as

210
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,819
part of Jupiter notebooks on the cloud

211
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,639
which is amazing we saw a really good

212
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,759
use of this Teo did some other

213
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,039
optimization and he's brought the open

214
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,379
source Adder implementations up to

215
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,599
parity in terms of power performance

216
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,599
area with the proprietary tools

217
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,520
um written a paper you can read the

218
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,720
paper and then you can click the link

219
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,120
see the simulation see the test results

220
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,860
and that's like something that's really

221
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,500
easy to share with academics and I think

222
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,779
that's going to be a really accelerating

223
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,820
factor of the open source tools at the

224
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,260
moment the open source tools are still

225
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,419
really far behind the proprietary ones

226
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,799
but I think they're going to catch up

227
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,200
quickly

228
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,000
so how am I doing for time I've got 20

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,459
minutes I think okay 10 minutes

230
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,519
so moving on to Tiny tape out

231
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,620
I need a better tagline so if you get

232
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,360
one if you think of one let me know

233
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,560
and the idea here is to further lower

234
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,779
the barrier to entry to get involved

235
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,220
um so you everything's in the browser

236
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,040
you don't download or install anything

237
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,440
you do a simple digital design you run

238
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,779
it through the Asic tools in the cloud

239
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:22,080
we put together 500 little designs

240
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,660
pay for a shuttle but split the cost

241
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,880
between 500 people and then that makes

242
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,920
it much cheaper and also a guaranteed

243
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,420
silicon the problem with the Google

244
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,760
shuttle is it's a lottery and at the

245
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,500
moment it's like a one to two contention

246
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,420
so you've got like a 50 chance of

247
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,920
getting in

248
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,500
foreign

249
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,180
audiences makers hobbyists schools

250
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,100
universities hacker spaces all of you

251
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,120
basically

252
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,019
an open source silicon enthusiasts

253
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,640
and we want to create the opportunity

254
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,680
for like young people to be able to tape

255
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,279
out so like often the first time someone

256
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,200
will tape out is like in a PhD project

257
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,519
because they've not done at a university

258
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,200
they've definitely not done at a high

259
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,660
school but with a tiny tape out the idea

260
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,760
is you could do it in a high school

261
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,500
then you do it

262
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,760
um for your degree and then you do it

263
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,260
again for your PhD and by that time

264
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,640
you've got loads more experience because

265
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,279
you've done it more often

266
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,680
so I'm collaborating with you

267
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,959
was that me

268
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,700
is that my jet lag did that really

269
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,940
happen

270
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,880
I don't think it's my mic I think it's

271
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,899
you in the back with a hat

272
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,459
transmitting on five gigahertz

273
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:42,000
you need one of these to dump the signal

274
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,700
uh I met URI in the last remotocon and

275
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,140
he's got this awesome tool called

276
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,560
walkway which lets you basically build

277
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,140
Arduino systems and teach them without

278
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,519
an Arduino you can plug them into

279
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,079
hardware and I thought that would be

280
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,680
quite a cool way of doing digital design

281
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,540
um and also he was like super receptive

282
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,760
and is very fast at collaborating so we

283
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,399
like built a basic standard cell library

284
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,720
you can draw your design you can

285
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,220
simulate it

286
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,399
um and you that all runs in the browser

287
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,440
and then we have like an API that lets

288
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,420
you fetch the verilog net list and then

289
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,000
pass that through to a GitHub action and

290
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,500
because the designs are open source

291
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,100
GitHub picks up the bill for the compute

292
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,899
and then we have

293
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,820
um maybe I'll just uh quickly show you

294
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,300
one of these

295
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,700
um so

296
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,120
Maybe

297
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,079
maybe this one

298
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,860
this is probably about as complicated as

299
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,019
you'd want to get with drawing gates in

300
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,060
the browser but then you can just run

301
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,980
the simulation and then it runs in your

302
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,360
browser and you can play around with the

303
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,860
inputs and see how the outputs change

304
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,779
and do it all in the browser

305
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,220
um how do I put this back into there you

306
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,120
go

307
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,459
and then the next bit is you take your

308
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,700
walkway ID you clone a repo

309
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,700
you add the ID into

310
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,040
um the info.yaml file and then the

311
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,019
GitHub action runs and it builds your

312
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,600
your Asic design so if we check that out

313
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,060
we've got this cool GitHub flow

314
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,839
that builds

315
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,220
can I not use a Mac

316
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,120
how do you scroll on a Mac

317
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,160
it doesn't it doesn't go any further

318
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,880
down there doesn't it

319
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,579
looks like it runs

320
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,839
I really want to show you this cool

321
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,139
picture

322
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,820
but it doesn't work

323
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,139
oh well

324
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,040
maybe this will work

325
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,800
nope

326
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,100
foreign

327
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,860
just be public

328
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,959
that is weird

329
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,720
actions

330
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,540
GDs I literally checked this like five

331
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,639
minutes ago it works on the PC I guess

332
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,860
it's just a Mac

333
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,260
um anyway you would get a summary of

334
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,180
your cell usage you'd get a picture of

335
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,920
what the AZ layout looks like and then

336
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,000
this link

337
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
is the uh the money shot that takes you

338
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
to a embedded 3D browser that I was

339
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,700
going to like wow you with and I can't

340
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,959
scroll on a Mac so

341
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,399
can design chips but can't scroll on a

342
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,139
map

343
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,380
um so we have like a little slot 90 by

344
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,000
120

345
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,860
um it's about enough room for 400 Gates

346
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,839
if you've done fpga stuff before you're

347
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
used to having a flip-flop and a Lut on

348
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,300
every uh tile but with a Asic it's

349
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,980
different because you can do your

350
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,700
combinational logic with tiny thin Gates

351
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,500
but when you put a flip-flop down is one

352
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,079
of the biggest ones so you're kind of

353
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,120
spending your area depending if you're

354
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,500
using flops or if you're using

355
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,300
combinational stuff

356
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,639
there's some fairly serious limitations

357
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,440
with tiny tape out we've only got eight

358
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,300
ins and eight outs and it only updates

359
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,220
those inputs and outputs at a like

360
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,820
maximum frequency of about 15 kilohertz

361
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,200
and the reason for that is because we're

362
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,240
putting all the designs in a long chain

363
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,279
and we basically have to copy the inputs

364
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,720
all the way through to the chain to the

365
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,519
design get the outputs and then copy

366
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,600
them all the way to the uppers

367
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,920
um this is when I was working on

368
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,079
slightly smaller 70 by 70 but just some

369
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,699
examples what you can do in that kind of

370
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,880
space

371
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,980
um and so up to that point everything is

372
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,139
like free on the website tinytapeout.com

373
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,540
but then you've got this opportunity to

374
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,540
pay some money and get your design uh

375
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,740
fabricated

376
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,980
so we put um your design into this big

377
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,360
long scan chain

378
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,579
uh hopefully we sell all the slots we

379
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,440
send it off to skywater get it

380
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,720
manufactured put it on a PCB and send it

381
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,399
back to you and the really cool thing is

382
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,720
you're going to have everyone else's

383
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,240
design on there so also building a data

384
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,579
sheet when you get your PCB back you set

385
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,800
your designs ID and then it's doing your

386
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,899
design but then if you want to check out

387
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,959
Sam zuluf's design then you set his ID

388
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,240
number reads how to do the test and then

389
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,639
you can see what he designed

390
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,680
um and we've also got like a design only

391
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,420
option

392
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,399
um so you pay 25 you just get your

393
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,399
design on but no board and that makes it

394
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,139
even cheaper for a hacker space so you

395
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,360
can like share one board between like 10

396
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,279
people and then that really reduces the

397
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,720
cost

398
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,459
or if you've already designed one thing

399
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,740
you've paid for your PCB then you can

400
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,420
like add another two or three designs to

401
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,519
check them out as well

402
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,220
so here's the scan chain

403
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,500
running all the way through

404
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,019
this is kind of fluid at the moment we

405
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,100
might like

406
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,839
depending on how well it goes we might

407
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,639
cut down the number and increase the

408
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,920
size or we might like that will also

409
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,720
make the scan chain faster so we're kind

410
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,839
of looking to hit that ratio of

411
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,180
how like what the level of interest is

412
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,120
how many we can sell

413
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,000
um how like how much of a disadvantage

414
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,399
only eight ins and eight ounces this

415
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,380
kind of thing so we're really open for

416
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,899
feedback get involved and let me know

417
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,699
a bit more information on the scan chain

418
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,279
there if you want to no more

419
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,220
uh hopefully that the time will be uh

420
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,259
shorter with global foundries they have

421
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,420
a Fab in Singapore that's a six week

422
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,440
turn

423
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,300
but you that's just to get the Wafers

424
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,980
out you still need to package them put

425
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,959
them on the pcba and send them out but

426
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,959
it will be a lot shorter than 18 months

427
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,720
it's definitely going to get shorter

428
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,740
um

429
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,319
so we see how that goes and then you you

430
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,660
would get a PCB like this you set your

431
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,880
ID there you've got your eight inputs

432
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,740
and your eight outputs but you could

433
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,020
also plug it into a board to do like a

434
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,939
breadboard to do

435
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,900
um experiments

436
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,459
we did a trial run tiny tape out one

437
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,919
I've got 150 projects submitted

438
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,079
mostly in walkway but we also had

439
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,359
verilogue chisel amaranth

440
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,640
we use 15 000 standard cells across all

441
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,799
the designs I'm not going to read out

442
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,120
the rest if you want to find out more

443
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,280
you can we've got the data sheet on the

444
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,639
website

445
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,660
um I already showed you some of those we

446
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,240
had like um we had a four bit CPU from

447
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
Tommy Thorne and we had an fpga design

448
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,320
from Myrtle that was amazing to see

449
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,760
someone put it

450
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,340
I think a nine Lut fpga

451
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,400
and instead of um building a

452
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,340
um a routing tool he's using a SAT

453
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,799
solver to do the routing she's works

454
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,720
with the osis HQ so we're into SATs

455
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,340
offers there

456
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,799
we had we had some fun contributions so

457
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,299
this is like a

458
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,120
an old school style data sheet

459
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,780
uh with a the regret index and the smoke

460
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,620
output up there

461
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,020
the the contribution from the community

462
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,000
was so exciting when we were running

463
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,860
this on the on the Discord Channel and

464
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,419
then people like doing like taking it to

465
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,280
the next level so at the moment the

466
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,020
datasheet is pretty junky it doesn't

467
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,820
look very good but in the end we'll like

468
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,679
make it really nicely formatted thing so

469
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,780
that when you get your PCB you also get

470
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,600
this awesome data sheet

471
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,419
and we're kind of launching tiny tape

472
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,760
out 2 right at the moment

473
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,380
um is sponsored by e-fabulous because

474
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,980
the current shuttle run is for qfn chips

475
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,360
which are three times the price so

476
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,220
they're helping us make it the same cost

477
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,760
as the wafer scale chip level package

478
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,520
yes I think I got that right

479
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,700
um and we're gonna have uh 200 tickets

480
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,160
for the 86 and PCB and 250 for the

481
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,179
design only

482
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,820
we've made some little improvements and

483
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,380
we've also got like digital design

484
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,440
lessons so for people who aren't able to

485
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,059
make it or couldn't get tickets to the

486
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,799
workshop tomorrow we're also going to

487
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,900
run like an informal one outside in the

488
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,440
alley at about 8 p.m tonight so just ask

489
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,240
people wearing the yellow hat if you

490
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,600
want information about that

491
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,240
[Music]

492
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,960
um

493
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,380
we we ran a survey uh mostly hobbyists

494
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,299
but got some people interested in

495
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,039
teaching

496
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,559
um or doing proof of Concepts I think

497
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,960
when we add analog mixed signal support

498
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,900
to this that will make it really useful

499
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,580
I was kind of surprised that we have so

500
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,520
many uh HDL harder description language

501
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,500
entries

502
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,960
um what I'm hoping for is that those are

503
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,760
the early adopters and you're all going

504
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,980
to like tell your kids and get them to

505
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,120
do a design

506
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,940
because we really want this to be for

507
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,919
people with no digital design experience

508
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,580
so what's next

509
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,660
um semiconductor Basics with sillywares

510
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,140
okay how much time do I have left

511
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,880
I think it's a 20 minute talk isn't it

512
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,380
I'm I'm really close to the end

513
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,480
um I'd like to just uh

514
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,919
talk through this so

515
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,240
one of the things that you'll be doing

516
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,220
if you sign up and get involved is

517
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,780
you'll be supporting the project to be

518
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,360
sustainable and we want to add more

519
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,580
things like more peripherals add analog

520
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,679
mix signal support and we also want to

521
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,700
cover

522
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,980
with walkery you're looking at digital

523
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,140
design through to the Asic and

524
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,160
Fabrication

525
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,440
but how does an inverter work how does a

526
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,059
mosfet work how does a semiconductor

527
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,700
work and so we've me and URI have worked

528
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,960
on uh silly Whiz sillywares

529
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,360
so this is running in the browser this

530
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,260
is

531
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,039
um using uh NG spice to simulate

532
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,900
and we've got a cross-sectional view of

533
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,120
this nmos transistor here

534
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,460
we've got the spice running here so you

535
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,120
can see it's as the input Rises the

536
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,679
output Falls

537
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,620
and we can say delete this gate

538
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,239
I can't delete on a Mac either

539
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,580
how about let's thicken the gate what

540
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,960
happens

541
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,000
as you draw

542
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,460
it uh automatically re-updates the

543
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,900
simulation

544
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,380
we can like play around find this place

545
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,000
zoomed fit

546
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,679
check out this cross section well look

547
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,299
what's this this yellow thing that's a

548
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,780
resistor what happens if we make that um

549
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,200
that's a resistor fatter what's going to

550
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,039
happen to this curve

551
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,960
so it allows you to get a like a

552
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,640
intuitive understanding of how

553
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,559
semiconductors work without any

554
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,059
downloading of the tools just put your

555
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,260
hands up if that blew your mind

556
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,600
because I was thinking unless you've

557
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,880
actually tried to do this you wouldn't

558
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,980
know but it's like

559
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,500
it it took me like three or four weeks

560
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,760
to figure out how to do this for the

561
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,020
first time and I had to download like

562
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,720
four gigabytes of tools

563
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,520
and then I had to learn how to use magic

564
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,620
how to draw it how to do extraction how

565
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,960
to run NG spice and we're putting it all

566
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,000
in the browser and this will become part

567
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,059
of the tiny tape out learning resources

568
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:30,559
so that's silly whiz

569
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,240
silicon wizard silly Whiz It's better

570
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,760
than magic definitely

571
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,039
uh this is the last slide so if you want

572
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,900
to click on any of the links then this

573
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,440
short link is uh bitly supercon

574
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,179
22-tt tiny tape out

575
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:46,860
sign up for my newsletter that would be

576
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,320
great especially if Twitter explodes

577
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,780
um but if it doesn't then that's my

578
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,640
Twitter handle I'd love to meet people

579
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,440
love to talk to people

580
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,539
although my voice is a bit sore at the

581
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,720
moment so uh talk via text is better and

582
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,520
I also have a like a really in-depth

583
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,200
course called the zero to Asic course

584
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,600
and if you really want to go

585
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,059
down to the lowest details and make much

586
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,100
bigger designs running at much higher

587
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,900
frequencies than

588
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,760
um consider taking my in-depth course

589
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,120
and that's the end of the talk thank you

590
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,649
[Applause]
