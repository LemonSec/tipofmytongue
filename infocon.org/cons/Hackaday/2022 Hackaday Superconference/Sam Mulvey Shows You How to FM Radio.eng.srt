1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,649
[Music]

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,200
thank you

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,719
yeah so a little bit about me I I don't

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,600
get out much uh I I tend to stay in my

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,160
home so I should probably tell you a

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,380
little bit about what I do here are

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,199
three artifacts from uh from my early

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,199
history the first thing at the top is a

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,660
is a is a cassette tape from the early

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,700
80s where I interviewed my sister's

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,719
stuffed animals

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,739
uh oh I just the the concept of being a

13
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,780
talk show host always kind of interested

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,660
me right uh like just from a very you

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,920
know from being very young like Johnny

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,500
Carson had a huge impact on me uh talk

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,360
radio in the Chicagoland area which is

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,820
where I'm from had a huge impact on me

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,640
uh that thing next to it is a hammerland

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,420
HQ 120 General coverage receiver uh from

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,399
the Korean War era I believe it's got a

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,260
couple six v6s in it if you wanted to

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,820
build a guitar amp

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,600
um

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,000
uh I actually cooked toast in it once

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,220
because you can

27
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,439
and uh the thing on the bottom is my

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,500
very first computer in Atari 400. it was

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,360
already kinda out of date by the time I

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,640
got it but I I certainly got my legs in

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,439
on that machine and that led me to three

32
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,540
things one is being assistive

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,640
administrator this is an IBM 3b1 this is

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,960
actually a computer I had once upon a

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,700
time and did work on

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,100
um funny thing is uh

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,020
I was at a Seattle Sounders game

38
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,820
recently uh talking with a friend of

39
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,520
mine who's a touring musician and we

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,020
were talking music he's like hey are you

41
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,840
a musician I said no no it's kind of

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,380
weird my family is musical but I uh I

43
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,060
stepped away I had to have a talk with

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,060
my with my father and say no father I

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,100
will not play the bass guitar I'm going

46
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,659
to follow the calling of my heart and

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,960
become a systems administrator

48
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,540
and then the guy looks at me and he goes

49
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,700
is it being assisted been basically the

50
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,720
bass player of I.T

51
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,258
yes

52
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,480
I'm getting a drink

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,580
the next thing I do is uh Camp Quest

54
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,620
Northwest is a science and skepticism

55
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,520
camp for kids in uh in Seattle or in the

56
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,620
in the Washington area we get people

57
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,140
from Oregon to Alaska and Montana and

58
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,480
Canada uh this was this year's outings

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,840
we made I had the kids make uh Jewel

60
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,360
thieves we fabricated about 150 jewel

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,120
thief kits and had them put together and

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,319
they actually had to spin their own

63
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,599
Center tap Transformers because I'm

64
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,040
starting a conspiracy to make guitar

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,480
amps cheaper

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,879
uh and then there's my ham shack up

67
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,980
there uh that was the antenna I was

68
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,480
gonna bring but it looked copper so it

69
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,640
got taken and then the last thing that I

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,340
did was I actually was a syndicated talk

71
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,120
show host for a little under a decade

72
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,980
mildly syndicated with the show called

73
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,840
ask an atheist with Sam olvi the subject

74
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,000
of which is not germane to this talk at

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,640
all but it is a thing that I did the

76
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,080
thing about these three things is that

77
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,760
they don't really interrupt that well

78
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,739
together they don't work together it's

79
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,420
like I have these three silos of things

80
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,980
that I love to do the things that define

81
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,180
me

82
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,500
now

83
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,480
with all this stuff you think probably

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,340
my favorite movie growing up was uh Pump

85
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,560
Up the Volume right kid in school ham

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,700
radio

87
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,340
talking about things but why would I

88
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,200
listen to some punk hit in school

89
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,620
talking about how the food is bad when

90
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,580
you've got it all on UHF

91
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,200
this was my movie

92
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,319
[Laughter]

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,480
this was the movie that really kind of

94
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,420
just grabbed me as a kid and as a result

95
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,519
even when I was in junior high I was

96
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,799
writing up plans in my notebook for a

97
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,540
shortwave radio station that would play

98
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,519
weird music and weird stuff because I

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,019
wanted to run and I knew it would never

100
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,060
make any money and I wanted to run a

101
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,400
failing radio station because a failing

102
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,780
radio station you don't have to worry

103
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,860
about like whether or not you're playing

104
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,019
adult contemporary music or what

105
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,340
percentage of your stuff is in the

106
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,220
billboard 500 or whatever you could just

107
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,599
do what you want because the money is

108
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,420
gonna end soon anyway but I found

109
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,159
something pretty close in community

110
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,959
radio

111
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,760
because a community radio station

112
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,478
especially in LPFM is a non-profit it

113
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,400
can't make money so the money never

114
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,740
comes into the first place that frees

115
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,259
you up a little bit works pretty well

116
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,880
so uh ktqa LP 95.3 FM in Tacoma is uh

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,560
LPFM radio stations let's talk about

118
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,560
what lpfn is for a little bit this is

119
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,180
what the FCC

120
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,419
has to say about the LPFM service now

121
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,040
usually when I use this slide it's to

122
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,540
scare people but I imagine this room

123
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,580
could actually pretty much read that and

124
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,560
get it but I usually Breeze over this

125
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,840
the thing is I do some engineering stuff

126
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,880
I understand broadcasting but to file

127
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,400
with the FCC they have a lingo and terms

128
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,680
of art all their own you have to like

129
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,979
hire special engineering elves to file

130
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,460
documentation with the FCC it's uh it's

131
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,560
something I'm learning but I am I've not

132
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,940
had something accepted yet without

133
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,979
comment so I'm working on that but the

134
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,620
idea is basically a hundred Watts or

135
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,320
less is what they say now what they

136
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,740
actually want is a 60 DBU or more to the

137
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,900
point in terms that I understand a

138
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,639
little bit better one millivolt per

139
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,460
meter field strength at a five kilometer

140
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,020
Contour

141
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,259
so we're talking real small

142
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,120
um non-commercial so like our

143
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,780
organization is a 501c3 most lpfms are

144
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,600
uh you can't make money you can't run

145
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,660
advertising uh think like an NPR station

146
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,639
and you're not far away from what I know

147
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,520
how an LPFM has to operate

148
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,120
um

149
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,979
and the thing is you can't just go to

150
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,580
the FCC and say one LPFM license please

151
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,340
they have specific filing windows for

152
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,160
when you can start an LPFM station the

153
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,380
first one was in 2000

154
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,220
and uh it was it had to fit into the

155
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,199
into the FM broadcast channels just like

156
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,940
any other Opera uh just like any other

157
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,979
radio station and given Channel

158
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,979
congestion in the FM band that left it

159
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:17,520
Rural and in the 2000 window most of the

160
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,940
stations were gotten by uh religious

161
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,880
organizations in rural areas where none

162
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,380
of the programming was locally

163
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,240
originated it all came from a satellite

164
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,639
or over the Internet so it really didn't

165
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,940
hit the community aspect of LPFM so in

166
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,020
the 2013 filing window they changed it

167
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,759
up a little bit uh you could get

168
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,199
something called a second adjacent

169
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,600
Channel waiver which means with what

170
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,940
they want is between two broadcast radio

171
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,979
stations they want two clicks of the

172
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,360
dial before you get to another radio

173
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,259
station

174
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,240
with the second adjacent Channel waiver

175
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,759
if there's like three clicks between you

176
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,199
and there's that spot in the middle you

177
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,060
can grab that spot and that's how we got

178
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,860
our station

179
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,520
um

180
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,460
now it's essentially unprotected which

181
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,720
means that

182
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,660
if you interfere with a broadcast radio

183
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,780
station uh you have to change you have

184
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,479
to make changes to make it work if a

185
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,860
broadcast if a commercial broadcast

186
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,560
radio station interferes with you well

187
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,960
into the brakes my friend I guess that's

188
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,940
just what you get and in our case

189
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,979
there's actually a translator not too

190
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:26,039
far south from us on 95 3 and we're

191
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,380
basically no precedence there so we just

192
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,599
kind of have to live with it

193
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:31,199
um

194
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,900
and here's a weird thing no Pirates

195
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,740
allowed which is weird because the LPFM

196
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,960
the idea the concept the lobbying for

197
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,720
was done in response to the clandestine

198
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
radio stations of the 80s and 90s it was

199
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,240
a direct response to that because LPFM

200
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,460
or Pirate Radio Stations were getting

201
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,979
lost people found we're serving the

202
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,840
community we're doing things that

203
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,819
commercial radio stations we're not

204
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,819
doing in the markets that they served so

205
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,319
they started so they lobbied for the

206
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,840
LPFM system it got accepted and then the

207
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,099
people who were doing this work were

208
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,599
suddenly not allowed to be a part of it

209
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,580
that was pretty lame

210
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,380
so let's look at a couple radio stations

211
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,120
this is a radio station from the 2000

212
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,720
filing uh this is kowwlp in Burlington

213
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,740
North Dakota population

214
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,900
1291. uh their construction permit which

215
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,699
is you now have permission to build a

216
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,580
radio station was granted in 2003

217
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,160
they're licensed to cover which is you

218
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,500
are now a radio station was granted in

219
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,020
2005. also

220
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,240
it's the cow

221
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,458
I kind of like that you know

222
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,500
I'd be on that station now there's this

223
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,000
other station I happened oh and then

224
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,880
most importantly uh you can see here on

225
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,279
the map that the entirety of Burlington

226
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,220
North Dakota is in that one millivolt

227
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,560
per meter Contour like the whole town so

228
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,660
they can reach their whole town

229
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,540
and then here is a plot from Radio

230
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,339
locator of all the stations that you're

231
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,660
going to be able to hear on the dial

232
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,540
it's not that congested it's uh it's

233
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,660
pretty free comparative compared to

234
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,240
a radio station from the 2013 filing

235
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,100
window which is the radio station I'm

236
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,320
well familiar with uh this is in Tacoma

237
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,339
Washington population 219 205. it's an

238
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,720
order of Magnum sorry two orders of

239
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,860
magnitude larger than the other

240
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,620
population in the other station uh our

241
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,300
construction permit was granted in 2014

242
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,580
we filed our license to cover in 2017

243
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,580
and it looks very familiar here uh first

244
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,620
things first you can see the uh the

245
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,720
band's a little busier in Tacoma

246
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,760
Washington it took some doing to find a

247
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,839
place to fit

248
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,120
and then the other thing is

249
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,580
this whole thing is the town and our

250
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,519
Contour does not cover the whole town

251
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,260
like we're at Tacoma Washington radio

252
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,940
station but we're really a Hilltop

253
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,620
neighborhood radio station that's why we

254
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,540
that's how we identify ourselves we're

255
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,200
from the top of the hilltop ktqa LP 95.3

256
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,600
so

257
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,980
I give that water now actually

258
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,220
the root gets sticky so yeah we we

259
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,140
played uh

260
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,140
OTR for about five years because we kind

261
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,300
of did it backwards usually you get a

262
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,500
studio going and get your people

263
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,360
together but we were nerds we were

264
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,800
really focused on the transmitter so we

265
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,060
worked on the transmitter chain first

266
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,040
and once we got that going we started

267
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,760
working on the studio

268
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,500
and that studio

269
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,140
we finally got the space in it coincided

270
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,100
with

271
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,100
2021

272
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,760
I had to build a studio with my friends

273
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,019
when you're no longer allowed to have

274
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,940
friends anymore

275
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,420
it was it was pretty tough

276
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,339
um you know a lot of the you a lot of

277
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,440
the usual channels I do for getting my

278
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,899
hands on hardware and Equipment were

279
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,760
closed to me because I couldn't really

280
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,220
be in contact with a lot of my friends I

281
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,860
had to do it essentially uh alone but

282
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,680
with advice and stuff like that over the

283
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,120
Internet there were a couple people who

284
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,160
were able to help me out but it was a

285
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,200
very limited build out

286
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,560
so I had to I had to think very

287
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,440
carefully and so I sat down and I came

288
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,779
up with a bunch of guidelines guidelines

289
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,040
I think you'll all be pretty familiar

290
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,000
with

291
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,860
uh I'll go through them very quickly

292
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,740
don't reinvent the wheel uh use Hardware

293
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,360
that already exists if it does the job

294
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,459
well and you've got it unless it doesn't

295
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,200
uh you know that's a fairly straight one

296
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
but then unless the wheel is square

297
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,300
now that has a lot of you know that that

298
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,300
has fairly clear in uh applications and

299
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,660
software but in hardware for example I

300
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,320
have an absolute ton of two preamps 12

301
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,500
ax7s 12 Au 7s different Power

302
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,060
configurations some they have Solid

303
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,579
State power some have two power

304
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,620
um am I going to use them in my radio

305
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,579
station

306
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:51,839
no

307
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,200
because tubes burn out tubes I mean why

308
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,640
do they burn out you know they have a

309
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,279
warmer sound what is that warmer sound

310
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,180
I don't want noise in my chain I use uh

311
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,339
I use transistorized microamps and

312
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,100
transistorized effects racks

313
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,220
um sunk time isn't it's a it's a it's a

314
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,500
corner case of sunk cost is you know I

315
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,180
have this project and I really want to

316
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,579
work and this project is a linchpin of

317
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,079
everything that I want to do and it must

318
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,600
go this is why I'm spending 80 hours in

319
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,060
the last 72 hours on it nope sometimes

320
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,820
you got to let it go and move on

321
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,279
uh be cheap and good of the good cheap

322
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,860
and fast thing but

323
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,339
be willing to spend extra money to learn

324
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,480
something

325
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,600
like when we were working on uh trying

326
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,700
to record it for the YouTube channel I

327
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,560
spent way more money than I needed to on

328
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,420
on camera mounting equipment because I'd

329
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,920
never done it before and I learned a lot

330
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,040
doing it I spent a lot of extra money on

331
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,660
cabling because I had some projects on

332
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,639
cabling I wanted to try I mean we've got

333
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,440
a budget of half a shoestring and like a

334
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,300
Pringles can

335
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,339
but it's worth to spend maybe a couple

336
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,500
extra inches of that Pringles can if you

337
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,700
learn something out of it's Community

338
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,160
radio education is part of the game even

339
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,079
if it's education for you

340
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,779
uh favor UCS over Devi's that that's

341
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,160
basically like

342
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,180
don't fix it in post like fix it now so

343
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,459
that if you have to use your Hardware or

344
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,779
software at a place you didn't expect

345
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,880
later you're not having to like rebuild

346
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,160
like the really weird structures it's

347
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,380
not actually about UI because most of

348
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,880
software and Hardware that you're using

349
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,459
in a broadcast chain the operator never

350
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,180
actually sees

351
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,899
um

352
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,899
favorite domain inertia this is an

353
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,279
important one

354
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,100
um usually it means don't make

355
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,660
everything web-based just because you

356
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,339
expect things to be web-based into the

357
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,620
software world but in har the hardware

358
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,019
world it was especially important

359
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,320
because we have an analog Studio

360
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,959
but a digital Studio link our link

361
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,540
between the studio the STL is what it's

362
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,980
called the studio to transmitter link

363
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,980
that link is digital uh funny I'll tell

364
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,540
you about it later

365
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,420
um but so what this means in this case

366
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,160
is that if you're in the analog world

367
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,060
fix problems using analog technology and

368
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,399
then make the conversion once and once

369
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,860
here in the digital world fix problems

370
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,440
using digital technology stay in the

371
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,540
lane that you're in when you encounter

372
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,839
problems and then basic the last one is

373
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,300
use Unix philosophy uh the difference

374
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,459
between a workshop with tools and the

375
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,920
tools uh do multiple do one thing and do

376
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,540
it well but they can be configured in

377
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,700
different uh in different configurations

378
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,620
and then the other one which is like the

379
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,420
car factory model which is a which is a

380
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,860
machine that eats car parts and poops

381
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,300
cars

382
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,540
um because our budget is so low

383
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,240
we needed problems to be transparent to

384
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,620
us and so on having multiple relatively

385
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,260
simplest simplistic systems in a system

386
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,420
that you can see the system or visualize

387
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,820
the system worked well for us in

388
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,279
developing the studio under our budget

389
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,380
so that's that's the design thing so

390
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,480
let's talk about what building actually

391
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,040
looked like

392
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,860
uh this is the broadcast desk uh this is

393
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,240
where where the action happens before

394
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,880
it's completely populated it's big it's

395
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,060
heavy it's mostly empty space because uh

396
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,579
it's designed to hire to hide like

397
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,240
hundreds of pounds of wiring because

398
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,620
everything is wired to literally

399
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,480
everything else and so the desk is

400
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,040
completely designed to hide it all

401
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,680
you've got a couple racks in there uh

402
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,079
you know the 19-inch data racks or audio

403
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,699
racks depending on who you know how you

404
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:38,760
feel uh we need obviously needed to have

405
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,980
white boards everywhere but rather than

406
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,860
buying whiteboards because my usual my

407
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,199
usual source for whiteboards uh you know

408
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,959
wasn't available because covid

409
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,579
um we went with white hardboard from

410
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,740
Home Depot that means it's technically a

411
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,380
wet erase board but it still works like

412
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,600
you know we just have to keep isopropyl

413
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,620
around

414
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,040
uh this is my uh this is my office

415
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,060
um on one side I have my desk and my my

416
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,620
file cabinet because when you run a

417
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,740
radio station you have files now you

418
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,019
have lots of files you have to keep them

419
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,540
that's annoying but then on the other

420
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,760
side is the much more fun part the

421
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,160
electronics repair Bay so you know

422
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,720
because when you run a radio station

423
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,000
you're also doing repairs especially if

424
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,399
you're using a lot of older equipment

425
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,620
recapping all day recapping forever

426
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,899
recapping until you die recapping until

427
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,240
the Sun Burns Out recapping until the

428
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,760
sentence ends you know I've learned how

429
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,800
to replace uh through holes or you know

430
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,880
put the rivets and through holes and

431
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,699
swage it closed uh because I did that a

432
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,180
lot that was a learning experience

433
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,399
um this is our fridge uh I'd like to

434
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,380
talk to that refrigerio guy because uh

435
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,300
this thing would really rather be a

436
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,440
Dodge Neon or a lawnmower because it's

437
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,660
loud and you hear it and it's not so

438
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,060
great for a radio station uh here's a

439
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,440
fun one

440
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,839
so there's this little cave here right

441
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,400
next to the whiteboards

442
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,980
and uh see that thing up there the

443
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,140
little box towards the top the little

444
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,939
cut out of the wall That's the light

445
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,099
switch for the whole studio

446
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,160
you have to go into this little cave

447
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,740
and turn on the light switch and it was

448
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,240
just weird and we wanted to use that for

449
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,619
storage but then you'd need like weird

450
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,720
switching so we just went with pan to it

451
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,099
and and moved the light switch out

452
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,020
without cutting the breaker because in

453
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,520
our studio space we don't have access to

454
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,760
the breaker that was an adventure

455
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,860
and then here's the bathroom

456
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,200
funny thing about the bathroom

457
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
you're in the studio

458
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,100
you're actually this picture is taken

459
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,580
from where guest 3 sits

460
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,039
and it has an exhaust fan

461
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,380
and it wasn't wired in

462
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,940
now we had to do something about it

463
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,280
because I think leaving that alone

464
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,600
violated the Geneva conventions on

465
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,520
biological warfare

466
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,919
so uh so it had a plug but it was

467
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,179
unplugged and we looked everywhere in

468
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,740
the wiring there was no switch for it

469
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,120
there was no way to control it So

470
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,500
eventually we just put in a pull chain

471
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,140
and that solved it so

472
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,299
we have the studio we have the furniture

473
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,400
we're ready to go

474
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,140
so this was about trash what sort of

475
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,340
garbage did you use to build the radio

476
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,220
station well first things first like CDs

477
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,780
might be considered pretty old Tech at

478
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,600
this point not because they are

479
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,220
um there's still a major method of

480
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,960
interchange for music on the local scene

481
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,840
because CDs are inexpensive and uh

482
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,240
they're easy to produce so we absolutely

483
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,640
see needed a CD player now this is a

484
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,100
circumstance where using uh

485
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,860
where where I favored learning over cost

486
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,980
is I went through a lot of CD players

487
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,260
and I eventually settled on they all

488
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,020
needed belts or something and getting

489
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,280
the belts was going to be kind of

490
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,600
difficult and belts were not something

491
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,240
that was really facile with yet uh some

492
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,700
of them were DVD players and that added

493
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,620
a whole layer of expense and then I

494
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,059
found this one this is one I actually

495
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,280
literally pulled out of a dumpster

496
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,140
uh it's an American DJ it's sort of low

497
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,880
end but it allows you to select for

498
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,820
samples I just had to pop it open and

499
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,460
and you know make all the RCA connectors

500
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,840
and all the audio and power connectors

501
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,520
make sure they were solid good to go

502
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,320
works in the studio

503
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,360
another one is a vinyl player because

504
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,580
yeah because you absolutely absolutely

505
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,679
need vinyl because vinyl is so important

506
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,080
to audio even though any aspect you

507
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,120
would get out of vinyl players are going

508
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,559
to be completely wiped out by the

509
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,500
modulation envelope of FM radio but

510
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,419
whatever you know vinyl's vinyl it's

511
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,240
cool I'm just as guilty funny thing

512
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,640
about this is that this is an MCS 6603

513
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,880
direct drive direct drive turntable now

514
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,520
you probably told belt driven is better

515
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,200
uh at home it is

516
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,179
you know in in the broadcast studio you

517
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:49,679
want direct drive because one you can

518
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,700
you can

519
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,500
you could spin it if you scratch it if

520
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,600
you need to and also DJ smash is a thing

521
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,340
so you want something that's pretty

522
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,900
durable

523
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,940
um this is funnily enough if you if you

524
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,320
watch Tecmo and you might be kind of

525
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,260
familiar with this MCS is a JC Penney's

526
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,200
there a house brand uh from the 70s and

527
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,419
what they would do is they would buy uh

528
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,160
Japanese equipment and just put it in

529
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,440
its own in their own enclosures and this

530
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,880
looks like something that you would buy

531
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
from JC Penney's but on the inside it's

532
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,340
a Technics slq2 it's actually a fairly

533
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,860
it's a really solid turntable it was

534
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,720
actually in Technics Livery it would be

535
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,700
worth maybe 10 times what I paid for it

536
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,280
five times what I paid for it

537
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,880
um

538
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,160
it's you know kind of related to the sl

539
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,900
1200 which is the turntable everybody

540
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,740
uses uh I actually I saw this and I was

541
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,240
playing with it and I'm like are you

542
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,740
sure you want to sell this to me you

543
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,240
could probably sell this like yeah no I

544
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,380
know what it is you know use it on the

545
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,620
radio station friendship is pretty good

546
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,960
and then obviously uh computers

547
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,919
everywhere uh there was a nearby

548
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,720
um real estate appraisal company that

549
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,980
was closing up or no they weren't

550
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,480
closing up they were moving to no office

551
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,280
so they were transitioning to laptops

552
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,360
they had a bunch of workstations they

553
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,039
didn't need hey do you want computers

554
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,840
yes I want computers I need many

555
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,120
computers also do you want IP phones

556
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,580
yeah yeah IP phones are great these

557
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,960
Cisco phones actually work pretty good

558
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,559
in the studio because of the uh uh of

559
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,600
the headset where normally you have to

560
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,280
get like a one you thing and you know

561
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,380
yeah specifically get a phone patch I

562
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,419
was actually I was actually just able to

563
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:22,860
use the uh

564
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,200
the headset Port here

565
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,179
and then just to make a make a converter

566
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,039
for it and put it into a unbaliled a

567
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,780
balanced audio box uh like a drv134 if

568
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,880
you want and do the job but that gets it

569
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,159
into the studio great

570
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,700
um and then finally this is the one that

571
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,799
we kind of lucked out on

572
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,679
is that there was a merger of two major

573
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,659
broadcasting organizations commercial

574
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,179
broadcasters where they were combining

575
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:52,500
their efforts

576
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,080
uh into a single Studio they were

577
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,400
basically going from the old one into

578
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,900
the new one and they said well this is

579
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,940
all going in the trash would you like it

580
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,860
yeah yeah I would definitely like it and

581
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,440
we actually got a lot of really good

582
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,400
equipment

583
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,640
like we have a top of the line broadcast

584
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,200
studio if you were in 1995

585
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,720
I mean it's really nice it is super like

586
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,280
we cleaned up the pots and and

587
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,620
everything and it worked really well but

588
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,940
the thing is it kind of had to sit in my

589
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,919
house for three years before we found a

590
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,720
studio ah dusting was a pain

591
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,520
so we have all the equipment now you

592
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,440
could totally build a studio without

593
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,140
professional equipment uh my previous

594
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,299
Studio used uh

595
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,760
um just a Behringer USB interface and

596
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,320
some touch screens as a mixer so it's

597
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,700
like you don't need that stuff but if

598
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,640
you got it hey why not use it

599
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,059
but underneath that broadcast desk so

600
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,120
you gotta wire it all together right now

601
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,100
as a system administrator or somebody

602
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,900
who works in in like data rooms and

603
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,940
stuff like that I'm familiar with the

604
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,220
dmarc which is the point where if it's

605
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,659
on this side of it it's the phone

606
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,340
company's problem if it's on this side

607
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,500
of it it's now my problem

608
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,900
so I mean there were wiring boards with

609
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,020
punch Downs in the broadcast desk

610
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,059
there's no demarcation if it's on this

611
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,620
side it's my problem if it's on that

612
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,659
side it's my problem but it's so stuck

613
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,600
in my head I call it the dmarc anyway

614
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,059
and there's three of them in the board

615
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,039
and yeah like there's specific punch

616
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,580
down tools and uh all all the old

617
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,380
networking equipment of your comes to

618
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,760
the fore when using this kind of

619
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,039
equipment and the thing is is I didn't

620
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,600
want to have to

621
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,600
like contort myself into the into the

622
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,700
rack to do all the punching so I made

623
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,220
them all uh removable and so they've got

624
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,780
special brackets you can kind of see

625
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,780
them in there to remove them I didn't do

626
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,240
very well on the construction I tried

627
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,520
using a wood router and it leaped out of

628
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,500
my hand and landed in my Crouch got my

629
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,880
crotch I gotta I got a pretty nasty scar

630
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,799
but I lucked out I said you know I had

631
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,059
sort of like okay if the blood reaches

632
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,440
my ankle I'm going to the emergency room

633
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,659
never did just a flesh wound

634
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,120
absolutely safe completely scared but

635
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,959
actually safe

636
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,440
so one other thing I did

637
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,539
thank you all right so another thing I

638
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,179
did is how do you wire it all up

639
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,940
well usually it's you go from one punch

640
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,919
block to the other with like build an

641
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,240
instrumentation cable and there's

642
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,820
hundreds of runs and and it takes a long

643
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,460
time and debugging it is a pain and well

644
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,039
I'm kind of lazy and there's a guy

645
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,039
there's a guy Arthur at uh Arthur

646
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,600
risotto at freeform Portland another

647
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,000
LPFM station when he built his Studio

648
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,039
it's like you know I just use RJ45 and

649
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,100
Cat5e everywhere for the wiring like no

650
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,080
really I was told that was terrible

651
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,059
every time I saw a snake it usually it

652
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,100
was in this huge box which suggested it

653
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,360
have a bunch of passives in it or

654
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,860
something like that like no it works

655
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,539
fine so I did

656
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,360
I tried it out I went to a big box store

657
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,780
I bought some Keystone Jacks I took a

658
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,620
handful of xlrs and made a couple snakes

659
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,720
uh and I and I found like a 50 the most

660
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,400
beat up junk like 50 foot Cat5 run that

661
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,140
I had and I used that as the

662
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,520
interconnect between the two ends of the

663
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,740
snakes most lost I experience is a third

664
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,240
of a DB

665
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,419
okay I can live with that that works

666
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,419
um yeah we just used commodity CAT5 I'm

667
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,520
able to run three balanced channels over

668
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,159
one piece of CAT5 uh using the brown

669
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,460
pairs as the as the shield now if you're

670
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,900
going to multiple pieces of equipment

671
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,100
like there are certain circumstances

672
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,440
where you don't want a shared Shield but

673
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,679
given this was all inter like intra desk

674
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,799
wiring that was less of a problem

675
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,820
um

676
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,220
in one run I was actually able to carry

677
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,580
two channels of balanced audio and 16

678
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,179
volt AC over one CAT5 AC run for the

679
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,520
headphone amplifier between the guest

680
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,980
desk and um

681
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,159
uh and the and and the broadcast desk

682
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,620
and uh so that's what that thing of the

683
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,840
bottom is there that led is to make sure

684
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,360
you get the the two cat five pieces

685
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,580
right because if you mix it if you mix

686
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,400
it wrong uh suddenly microphone 2 has 16

687
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,279
volts ac on it and that's not it's not a

688
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,559
condenser mic it doesn't like that it

689
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,000
doesn't like that at all

690
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,279
and then another thing I use a lot of is

691
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,140
oh my God I'm using Altoid tins

692
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,600
everywhere Altoid tins all day long

693
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,279
um this is actually building another

694
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,360
snake

695
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,880
uh for Cat5e

696
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,039
and it does the Run between the two

697
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,320
computers that give us our VoIP

698
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,440
interface and our digital media player

699
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,620
so that it can run both to uh the

700
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,779
broadcast desk and our digital STL alone

701
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,720
and so we did a snake like that so

702
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,039
that's kind of and there's a there's a

703
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,900
store in Tacoma called tinkertopia which

704
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,919
is a a community or a reuse store and it

705
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,960
used to be that I'd have to buy Altoids

706
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,000
and put them in a jar on my desk and I

707
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,820
like Altoids but not really like Altoids

708
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,059
they would just sit and stop being food

709
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,580
and become ammunition I mean minty

710
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,220
ammunition but you know

711
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,960
um so that's kind of the junk we use but

712
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,000
there are certain things that are not

713
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
trash uh in the studio there's times

714
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,740
where you really Gotta Buy The Right

715
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,640
Stuff

716
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,039
and one of the best ways to make sure

717
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,039
that weird old mixer and those weird

718
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,620
preamps and the weird wiring really

719
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,059
sounds good

720
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,799
is to make sure your inputs are as clean

721
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,580
as possible so one place I did not skimp

722
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,100
was on microphones I'm a big fan of

723
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,740
Electro Voice I have an re20 makes my

724
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,659
voice sound great uh it's a broadcast

725
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,480
classic in our studio we went with re

726
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,700
that's like a 700 microphone though and

727
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,960
that was definitely out of our budget

728
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,080
but uh Electro Voice also makes an re320

729
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,059
uh which is kind of the same microphone

730
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,760
but uh but it's a little cheaper it's

731
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,120
more like an nd27 runs a little hotter

732
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,919
um so it's actually a little bit easier

733
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,120
to work with and you can order them for

734
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,299
about 200 or at least in 2001 uh 21 you

735
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,679
could order them for about 200 bucks all

736
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:11,520
day

737
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,799
so they were the microphones to use

738
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,620
uh another thing that I I did

739
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,960
differently this time is I did an old

740
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,940
Ikea Hack this is my old home studio

741
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,860
this is now my bedroom

742
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,520
uh but it's not in evidence is uh those

743
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,500
articulating microphone stands are IKEA

744
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,200
lamps I just replaced the the Springs

745
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,020
with heavier Springs uh JB welded some

746
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,460
stuff onto them zip tied some

747
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,559
instrumentation cable on it articulating

748
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,659
microphone stands when I did this in

749
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,000
2014 articulating microphone stands for

750
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,039
150 bucks like no I'm not going to spend

751
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,679
that lamps are 10 bucks at Ikea I have I

752
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,380
have 35 bucks of Parts on it stand but

753
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,600
thanks to streamers and YouTube and

754
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,679
everything

755
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,919
uh microphone stands are cheap now uh we

756
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,299
bought them for 50 bucks and they work

757
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,700
fantastic so there's no need to skimp

758
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,080
there another thing that I wouldn't

759
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,820
skimp on before like you can see it in

760
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,400
this picture this sort of bag of this

761
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,340
Cloud Nimbus of uh

762
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,980
coffee bags so this is our Sound

763
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,240
Treatment this is rockwool insulation

764
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,039
wrapped in burlap sort of corseted in

765
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,200
the back my friend Sharon did that and

766
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,620
stapled to the wall works great for the

767
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,539
first 48 hours it's pretty dusty so you

768
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:25,740
want to run some precipitators or

769
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,240
something but if you don't if you don't

770
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,640
touch it it's not bad

771
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,279
um works really well but when I built it

772
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:35,820
uh RLX the the open cell foam used for

773
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,980
Sound Treatment was like five or six

774
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,600
bucks a square foot it was really

775
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,179
expensive but again thanks to streamers

776
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,760
and you know online content producers

777
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,500
that stuff is like a buck a square foot

778
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,840
now so if I were doing this again I just

779
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,460
buy that there's no reason to skimp on

780
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,279
that all right so that's the hardware uh

781
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,559
let's talk about the software

782
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,559
um I'm an Arch Linux user I know the

783
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,480
kind of reputation we get but in my case

784
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,820
it's uh I'm such an old guy that I'm

785
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,679
going to use a really old uh reference

786
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,120
to explain it like I'm like caveman

787
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,260
lawyer when it comes to system

788
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,059
administration like what is this thing

789
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,340
that it does for me it's less than I

790
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,260
want to handle it myself and more that I

791
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,059
just get confused when it tries to help

792
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:18,120
so it's like stop helping me which

793
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,620
actually could be the motto of Arch

794
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,460
Linux Arch Linux stop helping me

795
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,799
um obviously we're using Jack which is a

796
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,679
low latency audio server for Linux uh

797
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,240
we're we're actually by the way we're

798
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,860
trying to do open source everything if

799
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,200
it doesn't exist we're writing it

800
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,799
um

801
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,960
you know uh Jack is

802
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,880
Jack now is a competitor with pipe wire

803
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,899
I don't know if it's a competitor but

804
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,399
like an alternative implementation that

805
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,080
we're looking at but for right now Jack

806
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,820
seems to be a bit more stable

807
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,679
uh remember when I talked about the STL

808
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,360
between the studio and the transmitter

809
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,059
we're using Mumble for that

810
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,740
um so it's like we're using the same

811
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,539
stuff Minecraft players use to talk to

812
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:56,159
each other while they're playing and it

813
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,179
actually works really good the Opus

814
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,460
codec is fantastic

815
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,980
um calf Studio audio gear a little less

816
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,440
known it's a very good effects rack uh

817
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,880
specifically it has a multi-band

818
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,860
compressor which is really good for

819
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,899
fitting audio into into your 75

820
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,720
kilohertz of deviation for FM

821
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,440
um

822
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,440
uh Audacity Of course ffmpeg is a tool

823
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,760
that I use like when somebody hands me

824
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,399
weird audio I can put in some format

825
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,140
that people better understand

826
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,840
uh we use it for talking to ice cast we

827
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,460
use it for talking in a bunch of places

828
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,600
like it's just it is absolutely the uh

829
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,640
Swiss army knife that is designed to be

830
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,320
and then

831
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,020
um uh Audacity Of course and then Jack

832
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,480
capture for capturing audio AJ snapshot

833
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,940
for managing my sessions and Silent Jack

834
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,399
for dead air detection the FCC hates

835
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,220
dead air they don't want dead air uh so

836
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,039
we absolutely need that detector so am I

837
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,860
using sdrs oh boy Odie am I using sdrs

838
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,740
we have four in our transmitter rack uh

839
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,480
one to record

840
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,260
um

841
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,600
one to just record the radio station for

842
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,539
logging purposes this is open web RX

843
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,480
which we use kind of as a cheap and

844
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,820
on-site uh analyzer so we can see how

845
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,159
the modulation is going uh we have one

846
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,480
that's agile so that we can listen

847
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,840
around the band and then one more for

848
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,200
special things I don't recall actually

849
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,760
uh and so like I said we did write some

850
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,039
software uh the one we use the most is

851
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,840
probably system Jack which is a

852
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,299
interface between systemd and all the

853
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:28,799
Audio Apps we use they can run out of

854
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,340
boot and do all this system D stuff uh

855
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,559
Caroline is our radio automation system

856
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,140
back when we started the radio station

857
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,179
there weren't really good open source

858
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:41,460
automation systems yet and I needed one

859
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,620
in about negative five minutes

860
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,960
so I wrote One

861
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,000
it's embarrassing

862
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,580
because I wrote it in PHP

863
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,679
you can smack me later

864
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,620
or don't that's creepy

865
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,480
um I really should learn rust I

866
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,279
absolutely should learn Russ but PHP is

867
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,620
great if you just want C but don't want

868
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,020
to deal with C you know sometimes

869
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,240
um Jack Webb Peak is a Vu meter that

870
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,059
spits out data over websockets it's

871
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,799
adapted from some full code written by

872
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,919
the guy who does X42 meters uh Jack mini

873
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,440
mix websocket it's a mix it's a software

874
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,360
mixer that operates over a websocket so

875
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,940
we can control equipment via remote

876
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,740
um all the stuff that we're working on

877
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,799
is available at link github.com ktqa

878
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,200
uh and that's

879
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,480
and that's it that's the studio was done

880
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,159
and first we were going to take

881
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,460
leisurely time with it and sort of just

882
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,559
make sure everything was worked but I I

883
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,179
actually ended up running into a bit of

884
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,640
a hard deadline that I had to that I had

885
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,700
to meet in that during the process of

886
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,360
building uh building the studio uh

887
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,580
discovered I had a brain tumor

888
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,559
uh and suddenly so it suddenly it went

889
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,299
like ah we can take our time with this

890
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,340
it doesn't have to be fast where and and

891
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,260
it went to oh God I have to have the

892
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,700
studio running because next week I might

893
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,279
have the brain power of a koala

894
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,940
and it you know but everything obviously

895
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,440
everything went right

896
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,080
um and here's uh me a week after my

897
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,839
surgery uh I I'm not just completely

898
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,179
screwing up mask protocol here I'm not

899
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,460
like the odd I'm not the opposite of the

900
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,619
guy who just puts it over the uh over

901
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:20,820
his mouth and leaves his nose going

902
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,679
that's actually called a mustache

903
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,960
dressing and it's designed to hold uh

904
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,940
yeah that was weird you know I had a

905
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,760
killer joke about this I like I had a

906
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,199
really great joke when I wrote this a

907
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,359
month ago and I can't for the life of me

908
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,219
remember it it's almost like there's

909
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:39,199
something wrong with my brain

910
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:43,980
so you know it goes on and like so here

911
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,480
are these microphone stands they're

912
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,399
sorry not microphone stands these

913
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,859
speaker stands these monitor stands

914
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:50,520
um

915
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,739
they're great they they have great

916
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:55,859
separation between the desk and and the

917
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,660
speakers themselves so vibration isn't

918
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,580
so bad but you'll notice that they're

919
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,800
kind of tall and I don't think they were

920
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,920
designed for that kind of speaker and so

921
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,720
that speaker tried to kill me one day

922
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,980
it's Timber right on my head so and that

923
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,000
that's a

924
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,339
that's a heavy speaker I can really

925
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:16,680
knock you on your butt especially if

926
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,420
people have been digging around on your

927
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,099
head recently

928
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,839
um so we replaced it with cinder blocks

929
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,780
that we painted uh and then and this is

930
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,980
one of my favorite things you see that

931
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,020
white ring in there in the monitor the

932
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,200
cone actually delaminated from the

933
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,480
neoprene ring that lets it vibrate and

934
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,800
so we're like oh crap we're out of

935
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,240
monitor now we just I need to go get

936
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,520
another monitor that's expensive uh

937
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,980
Becky who you saw earlier that was my

938
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,420
wife Becky my cat Ruth you can figure

939
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,099
out which one was which

940
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:44,760
um

941
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,220
uh just did some research and said oh

942
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,079
yeah watered down white glue and toilet

943
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,180
paper you can reattach the cone to the

944
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,940
neoprene ring I was skeptical

945
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,940
but she did it and it works great and

946
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,920
she's like all right now we can paint it

947
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,200
and nobody will know it was broken I

948
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,820
thought about it

949
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,040
leave it

950
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,020
let them know

951
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,540
yeah it worked real well all right so

952
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,880
that's the hardware side but there's one

953
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,980
more hack involved in this station and

954
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,099
that's managing volunteer organizations

955
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:19,260
oh god oh

956
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,940
uh I've been involved in the volunteer

957
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,160
space for a long time

958
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,020
um and there's two problems with

959
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,640
volunteer organizations that I

960
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,160
experienced

961
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,200
full-throatedly one was gatekeeping

962
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,420
where people have their their areas of

963
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,460
influence and you had to navigate the

964
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,960
areas of influence to get things done

965
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,880
and the other was the albatross where

966
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,560
you are important to the volunteer

967
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,940
organization so they're going to give

968
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,920
you a board position and a bunch of

969
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,839
titles they're not going to pay you but

970
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,099
now you're responsible for everything

971
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:52,440
and everything will die if you don't do

972
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,820
the thing for the voluntary organization

973
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,880
I didn't want to do that

974
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,920
so we did it a little differently we

975
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,720
have a minimal board three people only

976
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,720
existential things are we on fire are we

977
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,640
being sued do we need to do filing

978
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,440
that's the and that's the only thing

979
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,839
that the board does we we meet once a

980
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:10,680
year

981
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,079
all of the decisions

982
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,900
are pushed into the Committees and I

983
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,460
even changed the committee structure a

984
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,079
little bit we have three standing

985
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,579
committees and they're divided in ways

986
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:24,060
that may not be obvious at first glance

987
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,859
there is the interaction committee which

988
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:27,780
is anytime the radio station talks to

989
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,720
anybody else and expects a response an

990
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,240
interaction a full interaction so that's

991
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,859
Finance because money isn't an act

992
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,540
interaction PR that's an interaction

993
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,940
marketing that's an interaction records

994
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,560
are an interaction because people will

995
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,940
be looking at your records if you're a

996
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,200
radio station so that's definitely

997
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,619
interaction production is is the making

998
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:49,020
the donuts that's that's the one you for

999
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,099
a radio station that's when a

1000
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,839
conversation goes one way

1001
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,119
and no real return is expected because

1002
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,980
it's broadcasting so that's training

1003
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,680
show production scheduling things like

1004
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,780
that and then third is the construction

1005
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,099
committee

1006
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,900
which is everything that if it hits you

1007
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,180
on the head hurts which you might expect

1008
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,160
which you might expect I have some

1009
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,260
experience with now

1010
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,240
um that's the studio infrastructure

1011
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,800
networking and streaming the RF chain

1012
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,380
archiving Plumbing both Network and

1013
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,940
literal Plumbing we've had to do that

1014
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,980
now you think I'd be as the chief

1015
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,359
engineer of the station that I would be

1016
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,700
in charge of the radio state of the of

1017
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,520
that committee I'm not I needed somebody

1018
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,339
in charge of me that's Tim I'm also this

1019
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,680
I'm also the station manager so it's

1020
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,720
this weird interleaving power structure

1021
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,700
that makes no sense but it works for us

1022
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,619
I like it

1023
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,619
so what are we up to in the future well

1024
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,839
we're going to be War driving FM believe

1025
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:45,420
it or not because the rule of thumb is

1026
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,700
that in community radio stations you

1027
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,859
know the wider your band The Wider

1028
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:51,839
bandwidth you are the less your range so

1029
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,900
the rule of thumb is go mono best range

1030
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,119
that makes sense for radio stations in

1031
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,300
rural areas I am not so certain it makes

1032
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,440
sense for a radio station like ours like

1033
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,960
we are co-channel we are on the same

1034
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,119
channel as a radio station 35 miles to

1035
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,820
the South that is so venerable it has a

1036
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,440
three-letter call sign

1037
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,200
and so I'm thinking we lose capture

1038
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,099
effect

1039
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:20,160
before our we hit maximum range because

1040
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,680
of co-channel interference I can do some

1041
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,220
math or I can buy more RTS RTL sdrs put

1042
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,740
them on cars and drive around a bit and

1043
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,180
actually just do sampling that way

1044
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,099
actually test it in the field

1045
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:33,960
which is what we're going to do

1046
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,640
another thing that we're doing is we

1047
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,460
have no on air lights we have no uh we

1048
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,280
have no cues it's actually fairly uh

1049
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,560
manual in the studio

1050
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,980
the usual solution to that is to run

1051
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,560
instrumentation uh uh wiring everywhere

1052
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,260
use the gpios wire them directly to like

1053
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,000
relay boards

1054
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,400
that seems like a lot of work

1055
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,200
why don't I just use some iot magic

1056
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,420
enchantment into an mqtt server and do

1057
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,280
everything that way that seems a lot

1058
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,260
easier then the on-air lights could just

1059
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,780
have an esp8266 in it that just

1060
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,060
subscribes to the on-air Channel and and

1061
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,220
gets that way and then I could put on

1062
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,420
air lights

1063
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,940
in my house if I wanted to I could put

1064
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,960
them anywhere

1065
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,480
but then that opens up something else if

1066
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,220
we go to stereo and I have mqtt and I'm

1067
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,420
using which is something we definitely

1068
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,880
want to do rdss which is the radio tech

1069
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,859
service where it tells you what station

1070
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,420
and what's playing on your on your

1071
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,700
equipment another thing it does that's

1072
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,520
important for uh help for lpfms is if

1073
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,040
you go out of range modern radios have a

1074
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,300
streaming link that'll just switch to

1075
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,740
the streaming link which is pretty cool

1076
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,720
it's not in a lot of radios yet but I

1077
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,400
think it's coming but the thing is

1078
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,339
there's a page in the rdss spec for just

1079
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:48,420
you know

1080
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,060
production data for the radio station so

1081
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,700
what if I jammed mqtt frames into the

1082
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,460
rdss stream of the radio station then I

1083
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,980
can get information about like I can get

1084
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,599
you know telemat telematics about the

1085
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,160
radio station

1086
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,839
without an internet connection which

1087
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,300
like you think well I mean don't you

1088
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,040
always have an internet connection we

1089
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,020
actually had an outage the day before we

1090
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,280
came out here

1091
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,099
and so like I thought it was just going

1092
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:15,780
to be for fun but like the utility

1093
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,000
became strangely apparent uh right

1094
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,980
before we came out here

1095
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,260
so the other thing the other thing that

1096
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,119
CD player

1097
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,040
what I'm running into and what a lot of

1098
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,480
radio stations are running into right

1099
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,339
now is that CD players break a lot

1100
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:33,060
they're really fragile especially audio

1101
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,500
CD players

1102
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,619
so we're gonna build one that uses a

1103
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,720
SATA optical drive so when the drive

1104
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,300
goes bad you just pull it out slap it

1105
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,060
another one uh probably some sort of SBC

1106
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,359
with a good D to a uh that can speak AAS

1107
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:50,400
67 or balanced audio or whatever you

1108
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,320
like it's an ongoing project we're

1109
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,339
actually working with some other radio

1110
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:55,140
stations on that project we're just

1111
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,579
getting started on it yet another reason

1112
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,280
to learn rust so why am I telling you

1113
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,140
about all this what was all this about

1114
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,359
this was fun

1115
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,060
see I had so much this is my dream this

1116
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,200
is something I've always wanted to do

1117
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,960
but Community radio

1118
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,579
I'm discovering that you know that

1119
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,079
there's not a lot of hackers in

1120
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,280
community radio that broadcast

1121
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,280
engineering is a very one it's venerable

1122
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,720
broadcast engineering has like been

1123
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,660
around for 100 over 100 years uh but for

1124
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,700
for such an old job

1125
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,680
there there's a lot of room for hacking

1126
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,960
there's a lot of room for Innovation the

1127
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,140
Community Development that we do in in

1128
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,940
this space

1129
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,760
broadcast engineering especially in

1130
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,400
community radio where budgets are so

1131
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,440
small

1132
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,079
like everyone stands to gain if we could

1133
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,880
work together on this every like there's

1134
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,920
so much fun stuff that could happen here

1135
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,820
so I'm inviting you one sec I'm inviting

1136
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,200
you to

1137
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,240
go out and find one

1138
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,140
there's lpfms all over the country uh

1139
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,260
go find one or even better there's a

1140
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,760
window coming up

1141
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,319
start your own

1142
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,960
I want to hear a hacker radio station I

1143
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,760
I couldn't do it I'd like to see

1144
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,520
somebody win please go forth find a

1145
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,079
radio station to work with bring the

1146
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:15,119
ethos that makes us what we are to

1147
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,180
community radio or start one yourself

1148
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,300
