2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,200
thank you

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,360
so our next speaker has worked on

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,279
designing and programming low-level

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,560
system drivers and is currently a cyber

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,320
security and full stack engineer in this

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,539
talk today he presents a self-powered

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,519
sustained irrigation monitor system

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,699
using blue Wireless snow card

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,399
and note carrier which charged the LiPo

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,500
battery through wind water and solar

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,579
power

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,860
please welcome to the hackaday supercon

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,220
stage Dr Iraq Meyer

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:45,120
[Applause]

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,340
all right well hi thank you so much for

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,320
for coming thank you to supercon to open

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,239
the doors to people that is just new to

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,820
the uh to the environment this is my

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,399
first presentation as you will notice a

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,020
little bit nervous here

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,940
but it's very exciting to be with so

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,980
many people sharing the same the same

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,280
passion as you can see we can do the

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,900
check ID

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,780
all there and I I as a first timer I

27
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,040
thought it was going to be a 10 minute

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,140
presentation it happens that it's a

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,600
little bit longer than that I hope I can

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,700
extend it a little bit

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,580
um but it might end up early which is

32
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,560
pretty good because it's a it's actually

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,140
before lunch so everybody can actually

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,180
go have lunch

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,860
um so

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,759
um

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,759
I mean how are you

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,079
oh yeah no

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,659
so what what is the trouble that we are

40
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,820
trying to address here it is starting to

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,200
become that now iot devices are starting

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,060
to be more popular inside our homes

43
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,780
which are providing uh electrical power

44
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,420
directly from our system from our from

45
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,220
our electrical architecture inside our

46
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,500
home but what's going what's happening

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,799
with outside that now that we want to

48
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,780
extend expand that

49
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,439
um

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,139
that usage of these devices outside and

51
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,500
collect data so um placing the sensors

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,379
devices in the wall and far away from

53
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,700
our electrical infrastructure poses a

54
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,560
a challenge on trying to keep those

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,239
batteries running on those devices

56
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,459
without having to go every other day to

57
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,440
refresh the batteries or change them

58
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,800
usually are driven by live providers and

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,060
they they need to be replaced

60
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,560
periodically before they are depleted

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,319
what we are trying to create here is a

62
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,819
place and forget approach

63
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,980
devices that you just put out there in

64
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,780
the in the world and you just forget

65
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,780
about them but you keep getting data out

66
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,580
of the systems

67
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,860
um this uh

68
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,519
this study is basically based on

69
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,379
English

70
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,280
go to the next

71
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,440
okay it's actually based from my my

72
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,959
daughter Elizabeth uh she she made a

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,360
project over hackster

74
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,599
um a first attempt to to solve the issue

75
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,120
and mostly because she was concerned

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,400
about uh irrigation systems in

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,519
agriculture there is a lot of water lost

78
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,040
and misuse because of lack of

79
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,319
properly tracking down how much water

80
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,440
and how much is being

81
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,319
provided to the fields so this actually

82
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,360
is one of her slides during the

83
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,720
sustainability Summit AT hackster and

84
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,239
she was nice enough to to share it with

85
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,440
me

86
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,040
um

87
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,519
and basically it's mentioning about what

88
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,440
type of irrigation systems are used out

89
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,860
there in in agriculture although the the

90
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,019
results that uh I'm going to be showing

91
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,299
they can be applied for other

92
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,640
other fields and names still stuck here

93
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,400
with this okay there we go so what what

94
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,580
did we use for for as the core system to

95
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,560
try to track down this uh this

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,079
information uh we basically use the

97
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,040
blues Wireless Wi-Fi card which is a

98
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,240
it's a new company that is uh

99
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,259
providing a

100
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,979
sock system system on a chip that can

101
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,600
allow you to transmit data through

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,540
cellular or also through Wi-Fi in this

103
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,300
case we use their Wi-Fi card we use

104
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,720
their

105
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,280
sorry about these spouses it's just okay

106
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,620
there we go that is the uh that is the

107
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,440
the node carrier board that they they

108
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,080
have and basically they have a m2c

109
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,680
little chipboard that gives you access

110
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,320
to Wi-Fi or cellular depending on what

111
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,919
MTC board you are you are using not too

112
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,919
fast and then we use also uh

113
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,280
and other fruit esp32 version 2 in order

114
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,160
to collect the data we are not using the

115
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
Wi-Fi capabilities of the B2 because we

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,759
are already using the note card

117
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,419
capabilities and then we also had

118
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,960
Ina 219 featherwin that is cheap that

119
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,139
allows you to monitor how much power you

120
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,100
are getting out of the Outsource

121
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,500
device like in this in this case uh in

122
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,940
the in the cases that we're going to be

123
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,720
seeing is uh water turbines

124
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,419
solar panels and wind turbines so you

125
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,400
connect the the power that is generating

126
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,699
that device into the ini 219 and it's

127
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,820
going to give you how much current is

128
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,400
coming from those devices how much load

129
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,039
is being taken out from the devices and

130
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,100
some other information and then we also

131
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,380
need a way to know how much power is

132
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,539
being given to the live provider so we

133
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,500
use an LC 709 203f

134
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,419
monitor chip that what it does is

135
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,280
keeping track if the battery is being

136
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,460
recharged how much battery left is in

137
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,960
the in the LiPo battery

138
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,220
and finally we we used an OLED 1.5

139
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,100
inches to keep track of the information

140
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,080
now I I kind of list all the all the

141
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
elements here just so you can have an

142
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,039
idea of how much power we are going to

143
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,160
be driving out of the system which if we

144
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,840
put it out there we are not gonna need

145
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,360
the OLED Graphics display we are not

146
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,479
gonna need the the feather Wing ionite

147
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,639
219 so that's going to save power so

148
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,080
it's going to be running for for a

149
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,819
little bit longer than what we are

150
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,240
currently using here and let me see so

151
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,979
the whole system just looks like this

152
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,319
it's a little bit bulky obviously but

153
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,520
it's just a

154
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,160
a prototype to try to make to figure out

155
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,860
if it's going to work or not

156
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,259
so how does the whole thing works so you

157
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,380
have your your data I I was I was hoping

158
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,819
the screen was a little bit bigger but

159
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,460
hopefully you can see it uh we have the

160
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,160
devices that is collecting the data then

161
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,319
it goes into the other fruit feeder that

162
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,720
is just working as a microcontroller to

163
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,360
collect that data then the information

164
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,940
is passed to the note card which

165
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,919
connects to not hub.io which is

166
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,460
basically a temporary

167
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,380
temporary space where the data is

168
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,940
located and then from there you can

169
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,460
reroute it to different cloud services

170
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,740
like adafruit.io or Amazon AWS or other

171
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,740
other devices other cloud services and

172
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,740
in this case we use adafruit.io because

173
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,199
it's uh in my opinion is the cheapest

174
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,360
and the fastest way want to to use

175
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,520
compared with with the other ones that

176
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,639
at some point your

177
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,860
your trial period ends and then you have

178
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,259
start paying

179
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,160
um let me see again

180
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,740
there we go all right so we started it

181
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,819
first uh with our with our

182
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:08,160
water-based testing we we call it liquid

183
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,259
electricity just to make a phone name

184
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,759
out of it

185
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,500
um we started it with just one water

186
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,360
turbine that you can see it up there in

187
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,280
the yellow and then there is a water

188
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,379
sensor that is nothing more than just a

189
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,000
propeller that is counting how many

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,740
revolutions the water is going through

191
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,580
there

192
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,740
uh the the turbine that we are using

193
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,400
keeps around 5 volts of power and about

194
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,120
93 milliamps of of current and as you

195
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,219
can see here in the graphs you have the

196
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,599
current and then the revolutions per

197
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,479
second when the system is running you

198
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,820
obviously get a peak over there that

199
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,919
gives you around

200
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,339
78 to 83 ish milliamps of power

201
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,100
however it wasn't enough as you can see

202
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,959
on the middle one the battery percentage

203
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,660
starts going down as the system is used

204
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,240
and it goes all the way down to zero and

205
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,680
the system is depleted so it was

206
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,019
basically not helping at all with just

207
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,480
one and then I started thinking I start

208
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,880
thinking okay so how can I try to get

209
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,220
more current out of the system and we

210
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,519
went into mosfets and Super Con

211
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,980
superchargers but it was It was kind of

212
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,480
complicated

213
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,279
um to put them together well not

214
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,779
complicated but they want to go into

215
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,279
that direction

216
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,640
so then I start reading how batteries

217
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,580
works together in parallel and serial

218
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,640
and there we go and the funny thing is

219
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,880
that parallel will give you if you

220
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,040
connect two batteries in parallel it

221
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,260
will increase the current but it will

222
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,360
keep your same voltage if you connect

223
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,700
them in series it will increase the

224
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,240
voltage but it will keep the same

225
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,459
current so I thought well why why I

226
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,080
don't use the side same principle with

227
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,519
the water turbines

228
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,300
so I I add another water turbine and we

229
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,180
have here sorry about the uh this sound

230
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,100
it's difficult to get used to this one

231
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,160
uh so you have here the the two two

232
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,959
turbines there

233
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,300
um and then the water sensor connected

234
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,480
to the same pipeline of water and voila

235
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,660
I mean I got a five bolt out of it the

236
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,880
constant constant voltage but the

237
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,200
current went up to 138 milliamps

238
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,740
um so but that unfortunately I thought I

239
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,959
I got it and I hope that the bill works

240
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,140
is it working

241
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,140
uh

242
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,540
no

243
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,820
well that that's an important part of

244
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,420
the presentation

245
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,620
okay not sure why

246
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,620
why is not uh

247
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,019
working

248
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,940
is there is there anybody that could

249
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,860
help

250
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,660
trying to figure out

251
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,380
is it what

252
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,279
I did mention them

253
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,360
it might not work

254
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,680
okay

255
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,660
let me see

256
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,240
um if I can

257
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,540
can I get access to a web browser

258
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,160
I'll took it there okay all right

259
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,560
uh

260
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,518
upper right

261
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,260
all right thank you yay

262
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,140
all right

263
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,200
lunch slice again

264
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,899
okay so let's go to this one here

265
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,719
oh I think I got it

266
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,420
yay okay

267
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,060
sorry about that but that's what it goes

268
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,060
so okay the sound is not it's not that

269
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,140
uh

270
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,720
it's not coming out but basically you

271
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,060
can see I I turn off the battery the

272
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,620
LiPo battery just to see if we had

273
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,079
enough power to power the whole core

274
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,120
system and as you can see the little

275
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,600
monitor it kind of flashes cycle powers

276
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,399
and that's because there was not enough

277
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,019
current for the system to actually

278
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,660
self-sustain itself when it was trying

279
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,459
to connect to the access point through

280
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,500
the Wi-Fi when you get to the point that

281
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,540
you run the Wi-Fi access point it gets

282
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,779
it needs more more current in order for

283
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,519
it to uh

284
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,620
and interesting

285
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,720
yeah I mean I'm sitting there myself

286
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,540
nice

287
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,639
well a lot of discoveries in this

288
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,980
presentation okay

289
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,019
I don't know how to turn off that so

290
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,600
let's just go to the next uh the next

291
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,560
one

292
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,680
so looking into that issue I thought

293
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,240
okay so now

294
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,720
how can I get there we go now

295
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,560
how can I increase even more the uh the

296
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,300
current

297
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,760
so what I thought well if two work for a

298
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,940
153 milliamps let's put six

299
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,720
let's try six uh water

300
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,839
supplies and here we see you see a

301
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,000
little uh maybe you can hit but there is

302
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,399
a little uh click click click at the end

303
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,399
because I added also a relay system in

304
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,160
order to get the flow going every 15

305
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,100
minutes every hour so every 15 minutes

306
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,360
15 minutes

307
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,040
the system

308
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,700
um

309
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,519
starts and works and as you can see I

310
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,920
was able to get around around 186

311
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,740
milliamps at that point it actually goes

312
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,320
all the way to 250 and you can see the

313
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,779
system there with six

314
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,839
six water turbines running

315
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,600
all together one of the things that I

316
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,700
noticed is that

317
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,899
the the flow sensor goes from 45 to 50

318
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,200
revolutions per second to 32 so actually

319
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,500
putting that many water tournaments it

320
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,940
actually affects the pressure of the

321
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,000
water going out of the system but it was

322
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,540
able to get 153 milliamps and if you can

323
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,700
see here from the

324
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,420
sorry hear from the uh from the from the

325
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,000
graphs you see the current peaking there

326
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,920
every time the system was coming online

327
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,860
which is every hour that's that's a two

328
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,540
cycle in two hours running 15 minutes

329
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,279
I'll explain the picture in a little in

330
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,980
a little bit but but basically when you

331
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,220
hit the system running

332
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,079
um with a current of of 4.5 4.3 uh uh

333
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,540
now the current is uh yeah I'm not sure

334
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,760
why they have for this anyway

335
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,019
um it it gives around 153 milliamps and

336
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,060
then you can see the battery how it

337
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,620
starts going up so this is the battery

338
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,800
percent and I had it around at 5.5

339
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,899
percent the battery life the battery

340
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,480
percentage and then during that period

341
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,420
of time in 15 minutes it actually

342
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,639
increases the the battery percentage for

343
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,740
around one percent of the battery which

344
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,019
is really good because it actually I

345
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,040
think is is is uh recharging the battery

346
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,199
and then in the next 45 minutes where

347
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,139
the system is not working the the LED

348
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,000
screen and the uh

349
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
and the communication with the not

350
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,160
Hobbies is still sending data so you can

351
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,899
see the battery going all the way almost

352
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,880
to zero and at some point it actually

353
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,519
reaches here but even with a zero

354
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,040
battery when the system goes back online

355
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,160
for 15 minutes you start seeing how the

356
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,320
battery starts getting charged again

357
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,380
and and then yet again it shuts down and

358
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,199
it goes starts depleting again and and

359
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,000
this is the revolutions per second here

360
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,420
a couple of disclaimers uh there was an

361
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,579
issue here with the counter that was

362
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:10,079
taking measurements and that's why you

363
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,839
see it at 450 it's not that it went

364
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,120
crazy and went to 450 revolutions per

365
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,100
second it's just that the the program

366
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,380
had a glitch there that I need to fix

367
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,199
and this other Peak that you see there I

368
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,120
was just curious about what happens when

369
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,980
you actually shut down the battery and

370
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,199
turn it on again individually so that's

371
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,240
why you see a little Peak there

372
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,139
so with these results the thing was okay

373
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,380
so what happens if I just don't want to

374
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,000
use a lipo battery

375
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,160
what if I just want to run the system

376
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,740
without a lipo battery will it work

377
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,279
and let's see if

378
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,839
I have the same tool again

379
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,860
sorry about that

380
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,440
put a slide

381
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,319
well but we we saw in two slices two

382
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,900
different slices with two turbine 96 so

383
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,900
anyway I'm just gonna cut out and and

384
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,260
and break it up here the the result is

385
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,480
that yes it did it actually worked and

386
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,980
you can see here in the picture that

387
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,780
little circle there that the LiPo

388
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,459
battery connector I just pull it out the

389
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,020
LiPo battery connector and leave it

390
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,520
running with yeah

391
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,520
with the uh with the turbine power and

392
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,559
as you can see from the graph I mean you

393
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,780
have your revolutions and then the

394
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,400
battery is zero because there is no

395
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,620
battery connector connected

396
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,780
and then you can see in the current it

397
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,240
goes from

398
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,419
150 I run 185 is actually when it starts

399
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,000
doing the connection to the access point

400
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,700
and then from there it guys reduces

401
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,960
because the connection is already

402
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,700
established and it starts sending data

403
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,299
to the uh to the cloud to the not Hub uh

404
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,480
service and for 15 minutes I have only

405
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,820
12 points but for 15 minutes it actually

406
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,820
runs and gives enough power to the

407
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,000
system to power up itself and start

408
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,340
running so what it means here is that

409
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,440
you can put this in an irrigation system

410
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,660
out there and just forget about it if

411
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,360
the battery drains out the only thing is

412
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,980
that you're not going to have any data

413
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,260
between the time that there is no

414
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,660
irrigation running to the point and

415
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,820
there is irrigation running and then at

416
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,400
that point the system comes in and

417
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,100
starts sending data to the and it's also

418
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,919
for knowing if there is any issues with

419
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,960
the pipeline because if there is no data

420
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,880
coming in in the period that is supposed

421
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,280
to be running then you know now that

422
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,559
there must be some kind of leakage in

423
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,480
the uh in the power

424
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,080
and actually we are not kind of alone in

425
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,640
this this last month the um the Oak

426
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,380
Ridge National Laboratories they

427
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,140
published this uh this research on

428
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,660
trying to use the water pipelines in the

429
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,700
U.S to generate power

430
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,919
because it's basically a waste of energy

431
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,160
that we are we are generating power to

432
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,380
pump all that weight with all that water

433
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,539
through our pipelines but we could

434
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,539
actually recover some of that uh energy

435
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:16,640
if we can Harvest uh the kinetic power

436
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,280
so the other thing that it can be useful

437
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,440
for and I'm kind of working on it is

438
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,700
just imagine that you could generate a

439
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,200
turbine that will give you around 500

440
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,440
milliamps with just one device

441
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,980
connected in this case for a cutie pie

442
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,480
esp32 picture that is extremely small

443
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,360
and just connect these devices into your

444
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,419
home system for water measurement so you

445
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,160
can actually figure out if you are

446
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,559
taking too long in the shower like my

447
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,039
wife always tells me or if you are

448
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,220
actually saving enough water when you uh

449
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,799
uses your water machine

450
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,900
so that's that that that would be

451
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,700
something interesting so if anybody here

452
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,679
can figure out a way to generate one of

453
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,720
those turbines that creates 500

454
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,120
milliamps that would be great I think my

455
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,700
knowledge kind of stops there

456
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,460
um but but having a community here that

457
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,620
that would be great to try if if anybody

458
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,140
can figure out so that was the liquid

459
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,480
part so what about the solar part this

460
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,460
is going to be a little bit uh a little

461
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,140
bit faster because

462
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,720
um there is not that moving Parts I

463
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,240
actually use four solar panels that

464
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,179
gives you five volts and when there is a

465
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:33,240
really nice sunny day you can see how

466
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,400
the battery starts increasing through a

467
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,860
really nice uh

468
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,740
couple of hours of solar power and it

469
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,440
actually allows you to recharge the

470
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,600
battery and make the system

471
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,039
self-sustained so solar as as we all

472
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,299
know is a very uh known source of energy

473
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,720
to recharge things and then the last

474
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,000
part is the electrical air or wind wind

475
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,580
power and for this I used to you know

476
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,900
from from Amazon to turbines two wind

477
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,200
turbines and connected to blowers for

478
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,960
let me see if it please

479
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,020
all right and connected connected to two

480
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,220
bits bit uh pumped herb torments and

481
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,559
both of them they actually give me

482
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,460
around

483
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,299
um

484
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:28,080
70 milliamps having two

485
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,380
um which it wasn't enough to actually

486
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,600
recharge the battery or run it but there

487
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,080
is uh there is some more uh studies with

488
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,400
wind turbines like Oscar Garcia and alio

489
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,159
for 3D printing vertical wind turbine

490
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,600
that I think they are coming up with on

491
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,140
version soon which it would be allowed

492
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,559
to give that much power but

493
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:55,500
as we are going to be seeing uh

494
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,620
done in the conclusions there is some

495
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,840
withdrawals there so the other thing I

496
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,600
was I was thinking and yeah this one is

497
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,400
not going to play either

498
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,480
so what what happens if we try to use a

499
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,480
standard DC lower

500
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,880
um connected to our cars when we are

501
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,460
driving we are generating a lot of air

502
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,539
friction through the car structure so I

503
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,360
kind of took that DC blower and too bad

504
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,400
that the video is not playing but I was

505
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,500
driving taking adhesive lower through

506
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,059
the window and trying to figure out how

507
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,120
much power would it get I actually was

508
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,059
able to get around 40 to 47 milliamps at

509
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,940
65 miles per hour and that's where a

510
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,880
little that's with a little DC blower so

511
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,280
if you can imagine if you put that fin

512
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,740
on the top of your truck or the bottom

513
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,559
of the car on the sides of the doors you

514
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,900
could actually be harvesting that wind

515
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,640
that is passing through your through

516
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,400
your car structure and you know I don't

517
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,260
know recharge something or connected to

518
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,440
a GPS system that could allow you to

519
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,980
have independent battery

520
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,419
tracking location

521
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,880
all right so uh

522
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,280
nice

523
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,280
so in conclusion

524
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,980
water flowing might not be a constant

525
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,860
flow but it's a schedule flow what that

526
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,039
what does that means do you you cannot

527
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,340
be pumping water 24 7 for an irrigation

528
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,900
system because you will be killing the

529
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,960
crops but you can actually know exactly

530
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,760
when you are going to be recharging the

531
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,500
the battery or when you're going to be

532
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,840
getting data because it's unscheduled

533
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,100
schedule a schedule point

534
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,039
solar solar is weather dependent if you

535
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:48,059
have a very nice day with no clouds then

536
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,220
your system might be working pretty

537
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,860
pretty well and you might be getting

538
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,140
data out of it but this is extremely

539
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,320
linky to how how well your day is going

540
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,659
to be and if you can actually move the

541
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,900
panels to follow the the Sun and then

542
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,780
wind is actually in my opinion kind of

543
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,780
the weakest for having a very scheduled

544
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,340
amount of data coming out from your

545
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,440
system because you cannot control the

546
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,780
wind you cannot know if you're gonna

547
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,340
have a wind enough uh day to

548
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,919
uh generate that much data I have to

549
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,960
drive 65 miles per hour to get 40

550
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,260
milliamps so that would be basically a

551
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,760
hurricane kind of thing if we've tried

552
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,460
to put it over our homes

553
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,820
um so as as you can see it depends on on

554
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,640
what kind of uh energy but I I do feel

555
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,480
that that uh harvesting that flow of

556
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,940
water through the pipes it's a good it's

557
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,299
a good start to try to figure out things

558
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:52,140
um so the the QR code here is is the uh

559
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,419
the hackster page that I have with some

560
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,580
other projects if you want to to go and

561
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,159
check uh the liquid electricity is up

562
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,860
and running the solar and the wind it's

563
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,520
it's coming in the next week to be there

564
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,520
and I I hope that you find this talk uh

565
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,280
inspiring uh the way I I found it when I

566
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,460
was making the whole system and that we

567
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,919
can save at least one gallon of water

568
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,500
from from our irrigation systems that

569
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,020
would care would help a lot our planet

570
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,240
at this point so thank you very much and

571
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,090
if there is any questions I'm here

572
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,480
[Applause]
