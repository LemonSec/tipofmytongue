1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,649
[Music]

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,100
all right so yeah um first couple

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,359
questions for you guys how many people

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,220
here have made a circuit board

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,439
nice how many people have messed up a

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,060
circuit board

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,320
wheat me too

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,359
um so yeah this is going to be basically

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,719
me showing all my mistakes and I'll try

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,579
to you know not further cement my

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,640
imposter syndrome here but I want to you

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,559
know show that everyone makes mistakes

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,480
and hopefully you guys can learn

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,860
something from mine and not make the

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,960
same ones

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,460
so my most recent giant flub was the the

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,600
Defcon badge this year

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,039
so for those of you who went to Defcon

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,739
I'm sure you saw signs and everyone told

20
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,239
you not to do certain things with your

21
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,939
badge because it will blow up

22
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,460
so there was

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,200
yeah

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,299
um the audio amplifier on it was very

25
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,240
fragile it was a tiny thing it's 1.5

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,240
millimeters square with nine pins

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,259
underneath it or nine uh it was a BGA

28
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:26,040
and it has a tendency to destroy itself

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,659
and we found this out way too late so

30
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:31,979
this is

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,439
one of the the big lessons with all of

32
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,060
these things I'm going to show you is

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,159
time time is your enemy

34
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,320
and when you don't have enough of it bad

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,460
things happen

36
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,740
so with all chip shortages and

37
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,820
everything that's been happening in the

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,280
last couple years we made prototypes and

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,600
they worked great and then things

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,460
changed and we couldn't get those chips

41
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,140
and then the way we were going to use

42
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,380
the badge changed so initially we were

43
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,060
going to use the audio cable as a

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,820
lanyard that was the plan and so the

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,680
initial prototype worked that way and

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,140
everything was great and we decided not

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,360
to do that anymore it wasn't strong

48
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,220
enough to hold up the badge right and it

49
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,538
would fall off and so we're like okay

50
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,940
we're not going to do that and then we

51
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,040
ended up not being able to get the

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,500
amplifier we were going to use and so

53
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,920
last minute change re-spin the board ran

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,200
a prototype and it worked fine

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,660
everything was great except I didn't

56
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,220
test plugging the lanyard in to itself

57
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,400
so this is another really big lesson is

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,099
regression testing right make sure you

59
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,560
test everything everything that worked

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,879
on the first one make sure the second

61
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,620
one does it too because

62
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,959
you run into problems like this

63
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,260
and so you may have seen

64
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,200
things like this we put stickers on the

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,080
bags for the badges we had instructions

66
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,519
in the badge the first time you turned

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,000
it on do not do this stuff we had signs

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,220
made that were all over the registration

69
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,560
area to not don't do these things

70
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,720
because your badge will break right

71
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,260
and we're like okay cool right we got it

72
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,200
solved and a few people will you know

73
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,739
make this mistake but it'll be fine and

74
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,360
then badges started coming in broken

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,340
like a lot of them

76
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,340
and

77
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,720
so we we realized a couple things one

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,860
when these broke on my test bench right

79
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,099
they looked like the image on the left

80
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,019
the board was a little scorched right a

81
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,760
little bit of burn marks I could replace

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,739
the chip it was fine

83
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,019
what ended up happening is people didn't

84
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,640
know what was going on Smoke's coming

85
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,379
out of their badge and they just said oh

86
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,540
it's smoking not not turned it off Don't

87
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,440
Unplug things and so that's what happens

88
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,040
and that is burned through traces

89
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,080
halfway through the board we saw some

90
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,060
crazy things and so that is not

91
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,040
repairable you can't just put a new chip

92
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,260
on there and so we ended up having to

93
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,879
come up with a work around people wait

94
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,140
people could

95
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,720
solder some bridges and cut some things

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,819
and make it work

97
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:09,840
um

98
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,879
and the other thing we found out was

99
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,720
that

100
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,459
not many people were actually creating

101
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,440
loops with the audio cable there was

102
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,959
another problem one that we didn't know

103
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,279
about

104
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,040
and it was this

105
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,180
the lanyard was the perfect size to wrap

106
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,560
around that audio jack and short it out

107
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,060
yeah

108
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,400
and we didn't see the lanyards until we

109
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,440
got on site

110
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,139
so yeah then we had this and people you

111
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,720
know just tape over that and don't make

112
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,310
a loop and you'll be fine mostly

113
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,900
[Music]

114
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,240
so yeah many lessons were learned on

115
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,240
that Badge of what not to do

116
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,780
um

117
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,180
so as a

118
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,520
another entry in the not enough time

119
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,740
category I'm going to show you guys a

120
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,139
picture that has not been public before

121
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,139
this was one of our plans

122
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,740
yeah so if any of you played the

123
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,600
challenge with the phones this was

124
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,340
actually our initial plan

125
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,759
we I 3D printed a custom acoustic

126
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,860
coupler for this and

127
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,840
in the end we couldn't make it work

128
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,120
because the little speakers were so

129
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,820
tinny and they would vibrate at random

130
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,400
frequencies depending on how

131
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,680
precisely they were placed in there and

132
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,780
the cover was placed on it that we

133
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,280
couldn't make it reliable enough to work

134
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,979
and so we ended up changing things last

135
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,900
minute with software to make it so you

136
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,900
just entered in numbers on the badge but

137
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,099
this was the plan

138
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,500
so last week was Saint Khan another

139
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,280
conference I do the badge for and this

140
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,699
one was also very last minute and we ran

141
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,460
into some interesting problems

142
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,919
and you're going to love this

143
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,539
the lanyards did stuff again

144
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,160
so

145
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,479
yeah when

146
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,560
here on the right side

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,300
um Saint Khan does a thing called mini

148
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,720
badges they're kind of like saos and we

149
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,580
do these little extender boards on the

150
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,900
badge and they're always a little bit

151
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,460
different design right sometimes they're

152
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,319
hanging off the bottom this time we did

153
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,139
them off the side and

154
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,580
the lanyards are totally fine with all

155
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,900
the prototypes and everything because

156
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,600
well I'm not sticking the lanyard on the

157
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,400
on the connections

158
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,699
but this is what happened and so we had

159
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,160
a few issues not the least of which is

160
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,220
that is shorting battery voltage to a

161
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,340
3.3 volt i2c connection

162
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,440
and

163
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,020
right there in the middle of the board

164
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,620
is a light sensor that runs on i2c it

165
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,979
doesn't like battery voltage

166
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,880
so I ended up coming up with a firmware

167
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,440
hack during the middle of the conference

168
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,660
to ignore the light sensor and I was

169
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,240
reflashing a dozen or so Badges of

170
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,800
people that had shorted theirs out and

171
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,720
it didn't work anymore

172
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,259
the other fun thing these boards were

173
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,120
half thickness they were 0.8 millimeters

174
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,580
and we did that because the whole plan

175
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,560
was you know it's a clue notebook type

176
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,539
look and so we wanted the thin boards

177
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,039
and everything well they're a little

178
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,639
more fragile and someone managed to just

179
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,400
rip their entire side piece off their

180
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,520
board just ripped it right off it was

181
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,419
super impressive

182
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,639
so along with the

183
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,319
the more fragile

184
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,900
uh thin circuit boards I learned some

185
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,160
other lessons

186
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,560
this is one of the connections for

187
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,759
down here right here this pen over here

188
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,460
and so I had a couple people

189
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,520
mess up soldering their little header

190
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,919
onto that port to the point where they

191
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,900
broke this via

192
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,620
and this red Trace is the 3.3 volts from

193
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,819
the microcontroller and everything

194
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,680
coming through here and then from there

195
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,660
it branches off up into the LEDs and

196
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,460
everything else that needs power

197
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,860
and so they just broke that

198
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,319
so no connection for power up to the

199
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,080
rest of the board so that was fun to fix

200
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,580
so lesson learned here

201
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,640
don't use a via like this right if this

202
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,659
is something that people are going to

203
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,620
touch

204
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,599
run the connections to a separate via

205
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,520
stub it off for this

206
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,779
anything that people can break they will

207
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,200
similar issue up on the top side this

208
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,480
ground via happens to be the one that

209
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,920
connects to that light sensor in the

210
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,760
middle

211
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,220
and so someone ripped this one right off

212
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,440
and no more power

213
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,760
so

214
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,899
yeah super great

215
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,680
so last year's Defcon badge

216
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,600
yeah that one was fun

217
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,440
um we had some weird issues with it the

218
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,600
the little connectors where you connect

219
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,100
boards together

220
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,519
I got the first panel from the assembly

221
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,760
house and you can kind of see it here

222
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,680
these connectors are hanging off the

223
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,120
edge of the board

224
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,399
just a little but enough that they're

225
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,980
hanging down luckily the connectors had

226
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,899
enough play but it was okay

227
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,959
but this was really surprising because I

228
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,000
followed the data sheet perfectly right

229
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,380
they should have been where they were

230
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,620
where they should have been the little

231
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,779
side pieces here

232
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,339
they

233
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,240
the edge of the connector got pushed off

234
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,580
the edge of the board Just a Little by

235
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,980
the connections in the back so even

236
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,620
though it was placed properly by the

237
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,180
pick and place right where it should be

238
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,180
the surface tension of the connections

239
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,860
on the back of the connector just pushed

240
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,060
it off the edge of the board just a

241
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,959
little

242
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,360
and there was nothing I could do at that

243
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,700
point right the assembly house had 10

244
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,680
000 plus boards and

245
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,880
there's no fixing that

246
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,200
another issue we had with those for

247
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,640
anyone who took theirs apart there are

248
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,500
these little spring pins that connected

249
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,540
the top and bottom boards

250
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,640
and as you can see up at the top those

251
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,680
ones are shorter

252
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,279
so this was shipping damage

253
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,040
these spring pins were four millimeters

254
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,980
tall and we needed it the distance

255
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,720
between the boards was like 3.7

256
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,260
millimeters like it was super close and

257
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,820
when they're squished like that they

258
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,720
don't work

259
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,279
so we hand fixed a lot of those

260
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,360
for the first

261
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,240
package of them that came and then our

262
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,100
assembly house came up with a super

263
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,019
great solution

264
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:56,760
these were what the panels looked like

265
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,640
and these are little rubber feet little

266
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,680
sticky ones and so they would stick

267
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,420
those on the

268
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,180
little pieces in between all the boards

269
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,000
and just like 20 of those on each panel

270
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
so that they would be separated from

271
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
each other in the box so that they would

272
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,060
not come damaged

273
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,699
this is crazy and lots of extra work

274
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,700
car hacking Village badge from a few

275
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,700
years ago this one was a lot of fun

276
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,899
so

277
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,480
with this one what we had we ended up

278
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,880
doing was getting a pick and place

279
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,860
machine ourselves and assembling them

280
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,959
ourselves because we're insane

281
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,120
and

282
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,060
essentially assembly was too expensive

283
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,519
to fit the budget and we decided we

284
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,200
could do it because it was only you know

285
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,899
like 250 of them wasn't a crazy number

286
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,480
and we're like okay we have barely

287
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,680
enough time to get these out before

288
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,079
Defcon and everything and the panels

289
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,959
showed up like this

290
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,940
they put white silk screen on those

291
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,899
boards

292
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,140
and so I you know talked to the the

293
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,700
board house I'm like what is the deal

294
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,920
and they're like oh my gosh

295
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,959
um can you use them like that

296
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,600
no no I can't

297
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,959
so this was three weeks before Defcon

298
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,800
so they remade them and a week and a

299
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,220
half later we got them and we did we

300
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,380
assembled 250 of these in a weekend

301
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,120
so that we could get them shipped out to

302
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,100
people before Defcon started

303
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,540
it was insane

304
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,779
in 2019 Saint con badge this may be my

305
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,000
favorite badge that I've ever made

306
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,220
it was awesome and insane and

307
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,300
one of the issues we had was

308
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,380
miscommunication with the assembly house

309
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,120
in China and these LEDs got put on

310
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,220
backwards

311
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,440
I don't know how many of them they put

312
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,500
on backwards but I do know it caused a

313
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,959
huge delay and

314
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,820
to their credit they flipped them

315
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,040
because again don't know how many I hope

316
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,040
it wasn't all of them but

317
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,040
these boards showed up the morning of

318
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,579
the conference

319
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,720
so yeah that was a horrible horrible day

320
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,740
um

321
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,800
and we ran into some other issues so

322
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,839
those boards are meant to connect to

323
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,519
each other on the side

324
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,320
you can kind of see the little side

325
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,899
connectors on there

326
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,060
and the top panels

327
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,820
for doing assembly they put these rails

328
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,779
on them

329
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,760
and then you've got these little mouse

330
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,100
bites sticking out the side well you get

331
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,720
two boards side by side and now there's

332
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,620
a gap

333
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,899
and so the connections were kind of

334
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,920
flaky and we talked about it and decided

335
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,660
we don't have enough time to fix it so

336
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,760
that's how it is and it worked okay but

337
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,060
yeah not not the greatest thing ever so

338
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,320
take that into account if you're making

339
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,940
boards with mouse bites that need to fit

340
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,779
together

341
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,060
you know push them into the board a

342
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,820
little or sand them off if you're not

343
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,660
doing too many of them

344
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,700
so

345
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,000
this was

346
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,500
dc-801 I don't even remember what Defcon

347
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,079
23 I think

348
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,959
and I helped design this badge my buddy

349
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,100
decaf

350
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,500
I had helped him with uh b-sides and

351
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,180
Open West badge earlier that year and he

352
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,740
comes to me he's like hey

353
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,899
we need to make this badge for Defcon

354
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:40,440
it's in a month can you help me

355
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,160
and so I very quickly threw together a

356
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,019
board design and we sent it off to be

357
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,420
assembled we didn't get a prototype we

358
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,100
didn't do anything because there was

359
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,720
Zero time

360
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,000
and they came back and there was a

361
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,199
problem

362
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,440
and we put we cut traces and put a

363
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,959
couple botch wires on a few hundred of

364
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
these

365
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,519
so that was a fun weekend

366
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,160
so

367
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,060
Lessons Learned time time is everything

368
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,440
okay it can be amazing it can kill you

369
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,540
um things will go wrong they just will

370
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,760
you need a backup plan

371
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,000
lanyards chaotic evil just you can't

372
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,040
plan for that

373
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,920
um yeah people will break badges in ways

374
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,000
you didn't even know they could be

375
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,899
broken

376
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:38,360
and then test and test and Test please

377
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,699
that's what I've got

378
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,959
foreign
