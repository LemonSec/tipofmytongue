1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,780
hello

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,520
um so hello I'm Sophie Wong and like he

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,100
said I'm a designer and a maker and I

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,580
love to make wearable technology but the

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,320
kind of wearable technology I like to

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,000
make I call artistic wearable technology

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,859
and I sort of make that distinction

8
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,380
because I know when I say wearable

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,140
technology a lot of people think of

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,840
consumer wearable technology like smart

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,239
watches and working VR headsets and I

12
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,360
don't really make work like that I make

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,480
work like this I like to put LEDs into

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,800
costumes and fashion pieces

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,860
in creative ways to sort of Imagine

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,719
maybe what the future might look like

17
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,159
like I like to use technology as a

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,000
creative tool in my process so I do a

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,979
lot of digital fabrication techniques

20
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,380
like I use my 3D printer and use my

21
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,840
laser cutter a lot and I like to

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,360
incorporate technology into the finished

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,580
pieces as well so I put a lot of lights

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,159
into things because that's a very

25
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,939
visually expressive use of Technology it

26
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,700
looks great in photography and video and

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,860
sometimes I do incorporate like a

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,080
functional aspect to that technology so

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,900
this is a skirt that has lights in it

30
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,060
but there's also a temperature sensor in

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,759
there so the lights will change color

32
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,900
according to the ambient temperature

33
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,100
and I just really like to dream about

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,700
what the future looks like and uh sort

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,700
of create costumes and fashion pieces

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,720
that kind of reflect my Visions

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,040
um

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
and recently I've been working a lot

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,799
with 3D printing on fabric which is a

40
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,380
really cool technique and if you were at

41
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,179
Super conference the last time it was in

42
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,340
person in 2019 I actually had this

43
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,780
jacket with me

44
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,959
um so it's an LED jacket and

45
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,720
um all of those hexagons on the back of

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,980
it are 3D printed directly onto fabric

47
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,200
so here's

48
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,840
um sort of a closer look at those

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,080
diffuser panels they're just pla printed

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,920
directly onto mesh Fabric and this is a

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,599
super cool technique

52
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,940
um that I I just really got into when I

53
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,220
found out about it and so another

54
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,080
project that I had with me last time was

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,599
this 3D printed dress so this is an

56
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,239
entire dress made with this 3D printing

57
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,640
on fabric technique and it was in

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,680
progress when I was here last time and I

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,680
actually did complete it so I want to

60
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
talk to you about how I finish this

61
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,239
dress and then I'm really excited to

62
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,000
show you what I've done after that and

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,300
where I want to go next but first let me

64
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,480
back up and just explain this technique

65
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,580
of 3D printing on fabric because it's a

66
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,200
really cool technique if you've never

67
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,720
seen it before or heard of it before

68
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,360
it's also not a technique that I

69
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,700
invented by any means there were a lot

70
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,440
of other people in the maker Community

71
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,040
working with this technique and sharing

72
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,959
their process and that's how I learned

73
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,940
about it and in fact the person I

74
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,620
learned about it from is here today is

75
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,080
David Shorey and if you want to learn

76
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,060
more about this technique which I

77
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,159
guarantee you will want to you should

78
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,019
definitely look up his work because it's

79
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,840
amazing and that's where I found out

80
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,500
about it so here's how it works you need

81
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,319
to start with a model like this which is

82
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:49,860
um

83
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,959
it's a 3D model where all of these

84
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,239
hexagonal shapes are individual bodies

85
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,040
so they're disconnected and they're not

86
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,799
touching each other

87
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,440
and you take that to your 3D printer and

88
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,120
you start printing your model you print

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,840
one layer and then you pause that print

90
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,959
and insert a layer of mesh fabric so you

91
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,360
want like an open mesh Fabric and this

92
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,299
is nylon tool that I'm printing on a

93
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,940
nylon mesh and then you resume the rest

94
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,519
of your print and that fabric gets

95
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,620
sandwiched between the first two layers

96
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,380
of your print so then when you remove

97
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,620
the print you are connecting those

98
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,820
individual bodies together and they they

99
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,780
become this flexible panel with whatever

100
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,180
your 3D printed shapes are attached to

101
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,120
this panel so here's another example

102
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,040
of what your model might look like so

103
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,060
these are all individual bodies and then

104
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,000
here's what it looks like when it's

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,759
printed so it retains this really cool

106
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,360
flexible property and you can sort of

107
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,419
manipulate and control the behavior of

108
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,820
this material purely through the shapes

109
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,680
that you're introducing to it on the

110
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,580
surface it's super fascinating and like

111
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,740
I said you really need to go and do a

112
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,080
search and look up David Shorey look up

113
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,440
so printed on Instagram and see what

114
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,540
other people are doing because

115
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,340
everyone's doing different things and

116
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,740
whatever shape you're introducing to the

117
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,660
material produces different results and

118
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,979
it's fascinating

119
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,259
so I wanted to learn a lot about this

120
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,759
technique so I went really deep with

121
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,000
experiments and I basically just tried a

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,820
lot of different shapes and models and I

123
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,400
varied the different I varied the shapes

124
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,220
that I was printing and also the widths

125
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,620
between all the shapes the depth the

126
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,180
amount of material I was putting on

127
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,880
there and it kind of just generated a

128
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,419
Swatch library for myself of ideas and

129
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,780
shapes and and behaviors and

130
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,880
um as I worked through all of these

131
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,699
prints on a small scale I started to

132
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,740
wonder if I could actually make an

133
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,259
entire garment like could I scale this

134
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,620
up to an entire wearable

135
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,100
full body garment and so I challenged

136
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,400
myself to myself to make a dress

137
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,580
and so this is the complete address and

138
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,500
now I'll show you how I got from those

139
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,500
samples to a fully completed wearable

140
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,940
dress

141
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,759
so I started with some visual

142
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,840
inspiration and some ideas about what

143
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,940
this dress might look like but I did not

144
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,220
spend very much time in this design

145
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,520
phase because I really wanted to get to

146
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,580
the actual creation process because I

147
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,860
knew that simply scaling it up and just

148
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,860
making it big was going to expose a lot

149
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,020
of challenges I wasn't encountering in

150
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,639
the small scale

151
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,919
so I kind of had a general idea of what

152
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,720
I wanted it to look like

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,819
and then I drafted a bodice which is how

154
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,819
I would make any dress out of fabric but

155
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,160
keeping in mind my output size so my 3D

156
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,800
printer is only capable of printing like

157
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,500
a panel around 10 by 10 inches if I

158
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,139
allow room to tape that panel to the bed

159
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,600
so I had to compose the whole dress out

160
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,580
of pieces that were small enough to come

161
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,520
out of my 3D printer and

162
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,160
um I used that swatch sample library

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,120
that I had generated to select

164
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,220
patterns and shapes that would lend

165
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,380
themselves to my design

166
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,180
and then when I knew what I wanted to

167
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,880
make I cut up my mock-up I literally cut

168
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,460
the muslin apart scanned it into my

169
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,340
computer and then digitized it in

170
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,800
illustrator and then I take those

171
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,880
pattern pieces into Fusion 360 and 3D

172
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,300
model my shapes so I spent a lot of time

173
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,819
in Fusion 360 figuring out how to model

174
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,259
all of this and I created like so many

175
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,440
bodies that my file almost like exploded

176
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,759
my computer

177
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,120
and so this is like a quarter of the

178
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,400
designed file and then here's what those

179
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,979
pieces look like when they're printed

180
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,400
out and just draped over my dress form

181
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,440
so I started generating these pieces and

182
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,300
I knew I had to figure out how I was

183
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,720
going to attach these pieces together to

184
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
create the dress

185
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,160
so I realized that I could actually use

186
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,360
another tool I could use my 3D pen to

187
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,759
weld the pieces together on the back

188
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,458
side so I'm just overlapping the pieces

189
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,099
on the front and then just welding them

190
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,260
together on the back so you get a really

191
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,099
seamless join that retains the

192
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,360
flexibility across that joint and you

193
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,940
know you can't tell where I've joined

194
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,820
the pieces together because I'm kind of

195
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,880
hiding it in plain sight in the surface

196
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,720
design that I'm creating

197
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,560
so on the

198
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,220
so on the left side this is my uh my

199
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,459
lining layer so I had to kind of deal

200
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,279
with the fact that I was creating giant

201
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,519
pieces of this 3D printed material I was

202
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,500
building up a lot of weight it's like

203
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,100
three and a half spools of filament

204
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,940
and I also was creating like a giant

205
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,839
walking snag Hazard it's like five

206
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,740
million Pokey points of plastic and they

207
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,300
all want to jab into your body when

208
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,220
you're wearing this so I had to keep it

209
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,519
off of my skin and then I also have to

210
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,440
deal with the fact that this mesh that

211
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm printing on is transparent so

212
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,040
there's an opacity issue you have to

213
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,620
deal with so this silk lining layer

214
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,740
solves all of those problems it adds

215
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,959
some stability to the pieces and some

216
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,260
strength and it creates some comfort

217
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,420
it's a comfort layer so nothing is

218
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,279
poking into my skin

219
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,019
and then it also is a functional design

220
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,779
element for maintenance and for cleaning

221
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:12,240
so I created this 3D printed shell in an

222
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,760
entire piece it's actually two pieces

223
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,440
because I kept the top and the bottom

224
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,360
separate but they can be completely

225
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,180
removed from this lining layer so that

226
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,000
when I need to do if I need to clean it

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
if I need to launder it I can remove it

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,580
and just launder the part that is

229
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,320
touching my skin

230
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,600
and do any maintenance I need to do to

231
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,519
this 3D printed portion and then

232
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,720
reassemble it back together

233
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,820
I also had to figure out how to put a

234
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,760
zipper into this thing which wait for it

235
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,399
wait for it

236
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,860
totally worked

237
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,820
um

238
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,260
thank you

239
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,399
um

240
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,560
yeah I'll accept that Applause because I

241
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,079
had to do that many times to get that

242
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,899
actually to line up and work

243
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,880
um but that's just hand sewing an

244
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,760
invisible zipper into a dress and then

245
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,380
on this side this is just kind of a

246
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,360
nerdy detail for my sewing friends out

247
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,100
there

248
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,019
I didn't catch the seam allowances of

249
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:17,040
the 3D printed layer in the seams of the

250
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,360
lining layer which is how you

251
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,459
traditionally would connect two layers

252
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,560
of a garment together but I wanted to

253
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,600
make sure that that 3D printed layer was

254
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,399
separate so I could remove it without

255
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,000
having to deconstruct the lining

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,399
um

257
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,740
so um it drapes really well on the body

258
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,200
and people ask me what it feels like

259
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,180
when you wear this and it kind of feels

260
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,540
like wearing like a heavy sequined gown

261
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,079
or like a chain mail because it's rigid

262
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,019
but it also drapes extremely well and

263
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,880
the weight of it just makes it kind of

264
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,380
hug to your body so it's it's pretty

265
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,600
neat I mean

266
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,120
um it feels a little bit like armor but

267
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,240
like if an evening dress was armor

268
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,779
um so here's a look at some of the

269
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,500
pieces that make up the skirt and here's

270
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,480
the skirt really getting assembled so

271
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,940
I'm making gigantic pieces of this

272
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,680
material

273
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,540
um and I'm doing a lot of those join

274
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,880
those joins so assembling it after

275
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,740
printing it was actually more work and

276
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,920
took more time than actually printing it

277
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,120
and so

278
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,600
um on gosh my dyslexia this is so hard

279
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,459
on the left

280
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,620
um it's almost complete but you can see

281
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,600
I left that that join in the middle

282
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,660
there so um in the complete dress on the

283
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,540
right it's you can still see that it's

284
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,220
separated and that's so that it could

285
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,260
split up the weight of the Garment so

286
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,660
the the weight is not all hanging from

287
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,060
the shoulders the weight of the skirt is

288
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,040
hanging from the waist and the weight of

289
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,660
the top is on the shoulder so that just

290
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,480
divides it up a little bit so I got to

291
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,160
the end I finished this dress and I was

292
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,079
like yes that's cool I finished this

293
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:05,100
dress but what do I do next like what do

294
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,440
I do with all of the stuff that I

295
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,260
learned from doing this and like do I

296
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,560
make another 3D printed dress which

297
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,079
maybe like makes sense to normal people

298
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,720
but I just don't like to make the same

299
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,839
thing twice like I I hate doing that and

300
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,820
it also got to this point of finishing

301
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,220
this dress during the pandemic when I

302
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,700
was already kind of like creatively

303
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,519
blocked and I kind of didn't know what I

304
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,860
wanted to do next with all of this

305
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,959
information

306
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,519
um because I looked at this dress and I

307
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,720
thought like

308
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,120
this is this entire thing was an

309
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,420
experiment and an exploration to see if

310
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,639
I could do this so it's just an

311
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,820
exploration of a technique and I feel

312
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,940
successful I feel like I completed it

313
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,220
but I wish there that I had spent more

314
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,700
time in the design phase and how am I

315
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,320
going to take what I've learned because

316
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,079
I love this technique but how am I going

317
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,339
to take what I learned about this

318
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,040
technique and apply it to projects in a

319
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,920
way where the projects are about more

320
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,920
than just how I made them

321
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,740
so like I said like the pandemic was

322
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,899
sort of like an introspective time for

323
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,240
me and I I had to like sit down and kind

324
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,060
of organize my thoughts around design

325
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,920
and making in general so I

326
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,139
thought long and hard about it and I was

327
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,480
like I need to figure out how I'm gonna

328
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,920
go beyond this technique and

329
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,660
I think it's because my background is in

330
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,420
graphic design I came up with a graphic

331
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,660
to illustrate my personal design

332
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,839
philosophy and um it starts out like

333
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,079
this it's like a triangle or a pyramid

334
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:55,560
and the first layer is tools it's the

335
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,920
widest layer because I love tools and I

336
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,500
want to learn about all the tools that I

337
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,199
can so I can use them when I need them

338
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,920
so tools this is where I put like my 3D

339
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,440
printer my laser cutter all the way to

340
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,800
like a bandsaw or even a hammer they're

341
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,540
really powerful and they're Force

342
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,060
multipliers but they don't do anything

343
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,079
on their own a tool by itself is just an

344
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,300
inert object like a hammer is just an

345
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,600
object but if you take a hammer and you

346
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,660
hammer a nail into a piece of wood

347
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,079
that's technique so you need technique

348
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:36,120
to make a tool really useful so the next

349
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,920
layer is technique

350
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,800
and I love techniques too I want to

351
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
learn a lot of techniques as well

352
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,000
because I want to be able to use them so

353
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,800
techniques are really powerful this is

354
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,860
where I put 3D printing on fabric this

355
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,240
is how I use my 3D printer and I love

356
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,360
techniques but I don't want to get stuck

357
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,699
on this layer so I want to go beyond it

358
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:05,240
so the next layer is concept and concept

359
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:11,000
is the core idea behind my project so

360
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,760
you know I think my 3D printed dress was

361
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,100
a great deep dive into tools and

362
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,440
techniques but now I want to go beyond I

363
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,180
want to take that and I want to apply it

364
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,380
to telling a story or communicating a

365
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,399
message or solving a problem and in my

366
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,760
design education my design professors

367
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,279
actually taught us to be sort of tool

368
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,279
and technique agnostic that you know

369
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,600
tools come and go and so don't rely too

370
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,339
heavily on a specific tool because

371
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,839
you're always going to want to learn how

372
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,339
to use new tools as they come out

373
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,620
software is a perfect example of this

374
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,839
we're always going to be learning new

375
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,220
software

376
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,899
and then technique as well like

377
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,880
technique maybe lasts a little bit

378
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,680
longer than a tool but it becomes a

379
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,800
trend eventually and then it dies too so

380
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,199
you want to be able to absorb and use

381
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,020
new techniques too so

382
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,900
don't Focus too much on that either the

383
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,140
concept endures so if you have a great

384
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,400
idea or great concept then it transcends

385
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,140
the tools and techniques that you used

386
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,900
to make your project so my design

387
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,599
professors were like make concept the

388
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,299
point of your work and I agree with them

389
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,460
a little bit like I I do think Concepts

390
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,679
very important and that if you can apply

391
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,200
tools and techniques to Concepts that's

392
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,020
what makes it really powerful but I also

393
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,780
don't think that concept is the end I

394
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,400
think there's something Beyond concept

395
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,660
and that's impact because it doesn't

396
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,299
matter if I have a great concept that

397
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,660
makes sense to me if my viewer doesn't

398
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,200
get it then that concept is useless so

399
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,720
true design success for me is when I can

400
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,380
use tools techniques and apply them to

401
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,000
Concepts

402
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,360
to achieve impact so that I can put my

403
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,100
project down in front of someone and

404
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,039
then get it they're like oh awesome it's

405
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,160
a whatever my concept was and I don't

406
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,679
have to explain to them how I made it or

407
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,620
or how it works for them to understand

408
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,059
why I think it's interesting so I still

409
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,799
think that tools techniques and concept

410
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,020
are really important but I want to just

411
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,500
remember that I want to design for

412
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,679
impact

413
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,600
and I really tried hard to come up with

414
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,080
a cool acronym for this but it doesn't

415
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,919
exist so I just call it Sophie's pyramid

416
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,460
of power

417
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,900
and just organizing it into this kind of

418
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,480
hierarchy just helps keep me on track it

419
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,160
gives me some goals to reach for in my

420
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,260
projects and I know I'm not going to hit

421
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,440
all the way to impact on every single

422
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,620
project like I think like I said my my

423
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,020
deep dive into the technique to make

424
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,120
that 3D printed dress like sometimes

425
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,160
some of my projects will purely be so I

426
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,039
can learn a technique or a tool but when

427
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,200
I want to go beyond technique this will

428
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,440
be my strategy to get there so here's my

429
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,419
little cheat sheet of what all the

430
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,960
layers mean and then I I was working on

431
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,020
this slide deck right before Halloween

432
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,679
so I also turned it into a candy corn so

433
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,660
it's a candy corn of power

434
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,380
so the next few projects are more

435
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,860
attempts of just me trying to go beyond

436
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,419
technique with this 3D printing on

437
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:48,059
fabric Thing and complete some projects

438
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,460
but try to keep in mind my candy porn

439
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,760
candy corn of power oh that's a scary

440
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,679
thing to say

441
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,419
um

442
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,039
and I think they kind of achieve like

443
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,960
varying degrees of that because this is

444
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,419
a journey I'm on and you know

445
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,600
it's uh it's a work in progress so the

446
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,820
this project is a headpiece and

447
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,320
conceptually I wanted this to be

448
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,840
inspired by sort of like a 20s like a

449
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,140
1920s hairstyle because I thought that

450
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,240
this technique creates such great

451
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,760
draping properties I thought that would

452
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,980
be a good application for it on the body

453
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,400
and so I wanted to kind of achieve sort

454
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,520
of um a hair like quality so it's kind

455
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,580
of like a wig like a 3D printed wig

456
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,100
but it's the same process that I use to

457
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,720
create the dress and that's the great

458
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
thing about doing a deep dive into a

459
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,919
technique I worked out all of these

460
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,220
steps so I'm scanning my patterns into

461
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,980
my computer and just refining the shapes

462
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,799
and sizes over several rounds of design

463
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,620
and I intentionally spent a little more

464
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,740
time in this phase to try to visualize

465
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,720
what I was creating and just checking

466
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,059
against my concept to see if I was on

467
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,919
track to

468
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,100
um to create the impact that I wanted

469
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,740
and I did print tests like I always do

470
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,500
and this was like five million

471
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,200
retractions on my 3D printer and it

472
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,380
almost did not survive

473
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,960
um but you know sometimes you spend all

474
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,660
that time making a mock-up this is why

475
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,720
you do these mock-ups and I I put all of

476
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,539
these together on my head form and I was

477
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:30,900
like uh I I hate it like I didn't like

478
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,320
it but I knew I didn't like it because I

479
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,780
had a really strong Concept in my mind

480
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,299
and I was like this is not hitting it so

481
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,940
I went back and I redesigned and I

482
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,400
discovered this um Quantum pla from

483
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,740
matter hackers it's that dichromatic

484
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,860
filament so it's literally the filament

485
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,380
is split in half and half of it is pink

486
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,260
and half of it is gold and it's really

487
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,679
cool stuff like it depends on the angle

488
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,780
that you're looking at it it has this

489
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,659
color changing property so I saw this

490
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,419
and I was like this would be great I

491
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,940
think this will really accentuate the

492
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,039
kinds of shapes that I want to create in

493
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,720
this piece

494
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,059
so um but I also wanted to remember that

495
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,100
I'm making something wearable for the

496
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,780
head and I'm thinking of it like a wig

497
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,299
so I wanted to apply this color changing

498
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,480
property in a symmetrical way so I tried

499
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,380
to

500
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,720
um apply it sort of symmetrically

501
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,120
working out from the center of the head

502
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,919
outwards

503
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,840
and here's a look at one of the 3D

504
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,760
models so this is just one little piece

505
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,340
that goes over your ear

506
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,500
and here it is in the slicer and I don't

507
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,820
know if you can see that but it took

508
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,159
nine hours just to print this one little

509
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,700
piece and

510
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,900
when it was done you could see like that

511
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,200
color changing property is it's really

512
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,880
cool

513
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,280
so you know this is a material I would

514
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,299
put materials on the same layer as tools

515
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,580
and this is all the pieces that make up

516
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,240
the whole headpiece so uh this was about

517
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,600
60 to 70 hours of printing

518
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,340
but everything prints flat because I'm

519
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,080
designing everything flat and then when

520
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,900
I assemble it it wraps around the head

521
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,880
like that and then I'm using the same

522
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,380
technique of connecting all the pieces

523
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,480
together with my 3D pen keeping them

524
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,039
separate from the lining layer

525
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,080
underneath and so on the right there I'm

526
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,900
just hand sewing it together

527
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,140
and here's the finished piece

528
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:37,740
um

529
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,179
yeah I

530
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,460
I do think this might be an example of a

531
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,620
project that kind of only makes sense to

532
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,900
me a grant that it's a little bit weird

533
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,600
but I think that I'm on the right track

534
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,080
in terms of Designing for concept and I

535
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,700
think that when I style this up in a

536
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,620
photo shoot like I think the impact will

537
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,120
be there

538
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,059
so the next piece is a necklace and I

539
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,539
wanted to get a more dimensional

540
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:05,100
application of the 3D printing so I made

541
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,380
it much deeper than what I was printing

542
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,419
in the other projects and I also really

543
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,240
wanted to incorporate lighting into this

544
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,820
piece but conceptually I wanted this to

545
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,640
be inspired by the Japanese artist yayoi

546
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,159
kusama who does a lot of work with Point

547
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,679
lights and she makes these really

548
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,780
beautiful experiential installations

549
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,659
with just hovering points of light and

550
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:29,640
so I wanted to do something inspired by

551
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,820
that that wraps around the body so I

552
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,120
made a necklace and so this was a new

553
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,299
tool for me this is digital pattern

554
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,179
making software so I thought that this

555
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,460
piece because it's small and I because I

556
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,620
had worked out the rest of my techniques

557
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,600
I thought that this would be a great way

558
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,299
to kind of get my feet wet with some

559
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,340
digital pattern making

560
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,919
but then I still print it out and put it

561
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,440
on my Maca on my dress form to make a

562
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,840
physical mock-up because I'm just I

563
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,580
really need to see these things in the

564
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,580
physical world in 3D space so this is me

565
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,559
figuring out where the lights were going

566
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,640
to go

567
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,100
and then I use my same process to just

568
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,780
kind of scan that information back into

569
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,600
my computer and create

570
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,120
um uh like just the footprints of where

571
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,100
I wanted to extrude and then I print

572
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,520
that out on just paper and check it so

573
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,679
it can make sure that I'm on the right

574
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,120
track

575
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,940
and here's what the stls look like so

576
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,220
they're very deep

577
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,260
and this is the necklace in my slicer so

578
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,740
this I could print in one go it takes up

579
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,340
the entire bed of my 3D printer and this

580
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,419
is like two and a half days of printing

581
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,620
um and it weighs like 350 grams so it's

582
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,559
heavy but um but I love that I don't

583
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,240
have to do any of that assembly after

584
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,120
the fact with my 3D pen

585
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,460
here I am removing it from the bed which

586
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,980
is a pretty delicate process but I did

587
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,100
manage to get it off without damaging

588
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,640
that mesh material underneath

589
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,700
and then here's the complete piece and

590
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,520
it has this amazing like jiggly quality

591
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,880
that you I had no idea would happen

592
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,140
um you sometimes you just can't predict

593
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,360
these things but I do have this necklace

594
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,799
with me so if you want to see it come

595
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,840
and find me and you can you can Jiggle

596
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
It

597
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,919
uh and then I also added that Silk

598
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,299
lining again

599
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:37,200
um and this time it also is housing the

600
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,360
circuit so these are the programmable

601
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,320
LEDs that I added into this piece

602
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,840
and this is really cool so when you use

603
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,419
digital software to create your patterns

604
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,940
and you can create every layer with the

605
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,179
same file it lines up perfectly so

606
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,460
that's just a really satisfying and

607
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,840
efficient

608
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,799
um benefit to uh working in this digital

609
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,559
workflow so that's the finished piece on

610
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,679
on the on the right and um I feel like

611
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,480
I'm getting closer to the top of my

612
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,640
pyramid here because I can look at this

613
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,799
piece and I can see how I'm going to

614
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,980
style it what it would be useful for and

615
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,020
what kind of outfit or costume this

616
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,299
could go with

617
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,100
so this is the last piece I'm going to

618
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,600
share and I have this piece with me as

619
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,940
well this is a glove that I made with

620
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,700
the 3D printing on fabric technique but

621
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,700
I really wanted to use the 3D printing

622
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,900
on fabric in service of a strong concept

623
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,440
so I decided that this piece was going

624
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,799
to be the first piece of a spacesuit so

625
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,640
I'm designing a glove that I can expand

626
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,080
out to create an entire spacesuit

627
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,659
and so rather than cover the entire

628
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,779
glove with 3D printed fabric I thought

629
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:01,020
about where it could apply it on this

630
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,880
piece where it would make the most sense

631
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,419
so I kept it on the flatter part of the

632
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,520
arm so it doesn't go past the knuckles

633
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,820
and then the fingers are actually just

634
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,840
3D printed TPU so it's flexible filament

635
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,940
so the fingers retain the most

636
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,580
flexibility and then the rest of the

637
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,940
glove is is soft enough for your wrist

638
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,400
movement and your arm movement

639
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,559
I know it looks kind of like a Nintendo

640
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,580
Power Glove but think spacesuit

641
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,400
so this is a mock-up of the of my idea

642
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,279
for creating that outer glove so that

643
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,679
muslin areas where I wanted to put the

644
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,140
3D printed Fabric and my idea was just

645
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,620
to slip it over an existing glove and to

646
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,600
keep that layer separate so that if I

647
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,340
want to resize this for a different

648
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,039
person that has a different size hand I

649
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,679
can just switch out that glove from

650
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,659
underneath

651
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:00,120
so this is just piecing together ideas

652
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,100
and mocking up ideas with physical

653
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,340
materials and I wanted to see if I could

654
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,539
use these flexible tiny silicone-coated

655
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,720
LED strands to make this glove light up

656
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,500
so I wanted to fit them between the

657
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,220
layer the um the spaces between my 3D

658
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,220
printed shapes

659
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,460
and I always do a lot of print tests

660
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,640
when I'm developing my idea so this is

661
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,679
an example of one of those tests and I'm

662
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,679
printing directly on a mirror and that's

663
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,520
giving me a really shiny flat surface

664
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,059
coming off the bed so the white

665
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,640
um the white shapes they kind of look

666
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,059
like ceramic tiles which I think is

667
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:51,419
um evocative of space materials you know

668
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,320
the outside of us of the Space Shuttle

669
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,659
and then it's my usual workflow of going

670
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,220
back and forth between the digital world

671
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,779
and the physical world and kind of

672
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:03,779
refining the shapes and doing several

673
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,179
rounds of printing and drawing and

674
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,520
scanning and then Printing and drawing

675
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,899
and scanning

676
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,720
so by the time I sit down to make my 3D

677
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,620
model I know exactly what I want to make

678
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,020
and it's um so this model came together

679
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,799
really quickly this is about 750 bodies

680
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,140
this this was actually no problem for

681
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,960
Fusion 360 because now I'm working on a

682
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,860
smaller

683
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,240
amount of surface area

684
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,260
and it's the same technique of

685
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,880
connecting the pieces together with the

686
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,220
3D pen but this time I realized that I

687
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,140
wanted to use the same color as my

688
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,659
backing material so if I get any you

689
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,880
know over

690
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,700
Schmutz you can't see it because it just

691
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,799
Blends in with that layer

692
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,820
um

693
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,620
and here you can see that it's really

694
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,000
flexible so it's it's a very soft and

695
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,799
malleable kind of layer out there and

696
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,559
here is some of my tedious hand sewing

697
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,020
that I had to do to connect it to the

698
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,600
glove but again I I like connecting

699
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,340
these layers together with hand sewing

700
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,440
instead of Something Like Glue because

701
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,080
hand sewing is really easy to remove and

702
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,240
it's non-destructive and it's really

703
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,940
quick to put back in

704
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,159
and that's the complete outer glove

705
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,120
before I put any lining into it so I had

706
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,340
to make that vinyl under layer from

707
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,120
scratch as well

708
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,659
um and then for the fingers like I said

709
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,520
I just wanted to print some flat shapes

710
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,039
in TPU so

711
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,500
um I traced the finger shapes and then

712
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,600
just created those shapes in illustrator

713
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,419
actually extruded them in fusion 360.

714
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:52,399
and then this is the finished glove so

715
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,080
uh here you can see it all assembled

716
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,120
together and like I said you can come

717
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,919
and find me and hold it and see how it's

718
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,440
actually very light as well

719
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,500
um and it does light up and then on the

720
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,940
other side you can see how flexible

721
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,600
those fingers are they just um

722
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,880
my plan was to glue them into place and

723
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,240
then sew them down for real stability

724
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,159
but I didn't even have to do that

725
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:20,279
because my glue held so well so don't

726
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,919
sleep on super 77 because it's good

727
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,100
stuff but wear your respirator

728
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,080
so what I really want to do is make a

729
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,480
spacesuit out of this glove because I

730
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,059
feel like I'm getting to the the impact

731
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,760
part of my pyramid because when I show

732
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,799
people that glove they ask me like is

733
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,720
this part of a spacesuit and I'm like

734
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,020
yes it's working like it's coming across

735
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,360
and I'm definitely going to make that

736
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,700
into a spacesuit because I love making

737
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,740
spacesuits this is one that I made a

738
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,419
while back and this is an original

739
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,240
design and you know this is what I

740
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,279
really want to do I want to make things

741
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,679
that tell stories and I want to use

742
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:01,679
tools and techniques that serve that

743
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,779
story so

744
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,039
um actually something crazy happened

745
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,440
during the pandemic a filmmaker reached

746
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,720
out to me and asked me if they could use

747
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,140
my my spacesuit and one of their music

748
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,720
videos and I was like yeah that sounds

749
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,960
amazing so I sent this spacesuit off to

750
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,880
his filmmaker

751
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,360
um who took it to the Badlands in North

752
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,620
Dakota and shot this amazing sci-fi

753
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,919
Space video like spacesuit video using

754
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,260
my spacesuit and if you like science

755
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,080
fiction you should totally find this

756
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,320
video it's um King Of Misery by this

757
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,860
rock band called Saul and

758
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,640
um this is like a cool sci-fi story with

759
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,559
like a Twist at the end and it just

760
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,960
trips me out I can't believe this is my

761
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,860
spacesuit from my brain but I feel like

762
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,299
that is really design success for me

763
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:03,480
because I made a spacesuit out of my own

764
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,120
mind and this filmmaker said yeah that

765
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,219
makes sense to me I want to use that to

766
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,800
tell my creative story so that's a dream

767
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,760
come true for me and just like a sign

768
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,940
that I'm on the right path I think so

769
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,580
actually after this video he was like I

770
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,260
want to make another video can you make

771
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,219
me a suit so um this is another video

772
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,619
that I did as a suit for it's not a

773
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,619
spacesuit this video is about

774
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,379
um a maker kid who's getting bullied and

775
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:37,739
he creates his own Iron Man robot suit

776
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,280
to like protect himself from his bully

777
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,580
so I built a suit using that concept and

778
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,080
that idea

779
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,899
um and sent it off and they made this

780
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:51,780
video which is just like another like

781
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,719
crazy I just can't believe that happened

782
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,940
um but I got to use my design brain to

783
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,060
bring that story to life which is just

784
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,160
amazing

785
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,960
um and so yeah this is what I really

786
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,260
want to do I want to do work that tells

787
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,240
stories

788
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,700
so check this one out too this is first

789
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,579
train by Mayday Parade

790
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,079
um so if you want to know more about my

791
