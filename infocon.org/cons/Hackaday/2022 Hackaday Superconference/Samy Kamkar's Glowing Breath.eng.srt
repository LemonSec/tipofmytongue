1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:08,250
[Music]

2
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:15,960
thanks uh great to see everyone I love

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,400
hack a day let's see if I can figure

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,279
this out all right cool

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,760
so when I was 10 years old my mom spent

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,859
everything she had to get me this

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,800
computer it's the best day of my life uh

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,939
immediately because she was going to

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,340
University I was able to dial up into

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,380
the university get on the internet and

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,760
immediately I did what anyone would do

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,980
and I searched for The X-Files

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,320
and I want to chat with people about the

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,600
X-File so I found something called IRC

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,239
Internet relay chat I downloaded MRC

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,640
yeah you guys know IRC

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,980
I download IRC I went into a chat room

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,840
and I said who wants to chat about the

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,079
X-Files and someone immediately said get

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,879
out

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,820
so whoa uh we don't we can try to chat

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,500
about something else like what's your

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,660
favorite TV show and they said you have

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,400
10 seconds to get out

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,619
and I was so confused by this and I

26
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,479
remember like should I be worried about

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:10,920
this person

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,420
um and I remember my mom told me you

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,400
know don't ever give out your name and

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,840
don't talk to you know strangers on the

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,580
internet I saw this tweet recently don't

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,080
get in strangers cars and don't meet

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,640
people from the internet today we

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,200
literally summon strangers from the

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,360
Internet and get their cars

36
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,799
and I was thinking well back then I

37
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,060
didn't actually give this person any

38
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,920
info so they can't do anything to me I'm

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,259
invincible so I said no

40
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,299
10 seconds later the brand new computer

41
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,220
that my mom spent everything on

42
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,079
did this

43
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,119
I got a blue screen of death this is

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,960
1995 running Windows 95 and I freaked

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,900
out I pulled all the wires out

46
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,560
I turned off I I pulled them away I

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,299
waited 20 30 minutes I figured the

48
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,920
longer you wait the better it'll be

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,320
it'll it'll heal and I plugged

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,939
everything back in unfortunately

51
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,520
everything came back up but with the

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,780
adrenaline just rushing through my veins

53
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,579
I thought that was the coolest thing

54
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,100
ever how do I how do I do that I don't

55
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,200
do that uh after a couple of certain

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
weeks of searching I found this win nuke

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,300
95 written by this author uh Mr burnt

58
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,680
bogus of the Dem

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,480
and I thought this was so cool and all

60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,700
of a sudden I have this super power I

61
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,040
can do all sorts of crazy things and

62
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,379
Windows 95 Service Pack 2 came out and

63
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,120
my superpower was gone now I'm not

64
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,200
malicious I don't want to like crash

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,400
people's computers but there's something

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,900
pretty intoxicating about being able to

67
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,220
control some type of system that you're

68
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,300
not supposed to be able to right

69
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,260
something you're not supposed to have

70
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,239
access to I figured could I make win

71
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,700
nuke 96 could I make the next version

72
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,140
and that's when I got into reverse

73
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,400
engineering understanding memory

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,080
manipulation reading things like frack

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,580
and 2600.

76
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,980
and I've then spent the rest of my life

77
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,840
trying to figure out how to do that how

78
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
can I exploit systems and how can I

79
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,319
patch them and how can I exploit that

80
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,360
and that brings us to hack a day where

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,220
I've learned so much from all of you

82
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,920
um in fact it was oh actually uh I threw

83
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,900
the badge in the my x-ray machine last

84
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,760
night thanks Sam for the recommendation

85
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,739
on the X-ray machine so this is the hack

86
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,239
a Day badge from uh that you're all

87
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,760
wearing and it was a few years ago 2019

88
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,879
I was talking to Sam zuluf Adam zaluf

89
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,560
what a coincidence last names and the

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,599
same domains weird

91
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,400
um and also Alex Whitmore who's doing a

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,860
talk right now in fact actually you can

93
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,900
kind of hear in the other room if

94
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,000
everyone cheers so let's cheer for Alex

95
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,440
and then afterwards I'll just tell him

96
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,700
that was for you let's go yeah go Alex

97
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,018
yeah all right

98
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,099
she's gonna ask why were you guys

99
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,099
cheering it was for you

100
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,440
what oh my God hi Alex

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,920
[Laughter]

102
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,060
oh well I hope you enjoyed that that was

103
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,540
all for you

104
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,159
okay so we're

105
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,720
um I

106
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,920
we're just chatting about different

107
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,599
projects that we're working on and one

108
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,459
of the the concepts I had I have many

109
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,920
Concepts very few finished projects and

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
one was this thing someone handed me and

111
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,299
they said this was a USB condom or like

112
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,120
neuterer so what this thing does is this

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,319
is a device

114
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,640
that you plug let's say you want to

115
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,900
charge your phone in the airport you

116
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,879
don't trust the airport charger so you

117
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,040
plug your phone into this with a USB

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,220
with USB and it cuts off the data lines

119
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,779
and only allows power so you're only

120
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,699
charging like okay that's a good idea

121
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,500
but how do I know that this opaque

122
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,060
device actually is not containing

123
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,440
something else like a chip that's doing

124
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,000
something crazy so that'd be a good idea

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,280
if I made transparent ones and I gave

126
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,020
those out to people but that's not that

127
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,060
very very fun really what I want to do

128
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,380
is I want to make a transparent one

129
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,000
where there's two wires for power two

130
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,919
wires for data you see the data lines

131
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,320
stop because they're copper fully

132
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,240
transparent and then I use indium tin

133
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,280
oxide a transparent conductor to

134
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,220
continue the traces for the data

135
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,740
and because USB is actually high speed

136
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,560
when you have a high speed line and you

137
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,380
put another let's say just wire coming

138
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,360
out zigzagging you now have an antenna

139
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,919
so you'd actually have a fully

140
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,720
transparent USB neuter that's really

141
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,360
just radiating all the information but

142
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,380
um so I thought that would be cool so I

143
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,900
got this stuff from Ito um on plastic

144
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,540
sheet pet from at a fruit I tried

145
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,340
cutting I tried making a couple versions

146
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,900
it was just super obvious that there was

147
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,699
something really really fishy so I

148
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,800
thought okay how do they make a Ito like

149
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,240
I don't know how can I just make it

150
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,620
myself can I make it at home and then I

151
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,180
can make a really nice version

152
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,400
um so I Googled how to make Ito and I

153
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,680
was like why why is Google tell us how

154
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,300
fast the search is like we know you're

155
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,740
the best Google like no one's saying

156
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,280
let's Bing it we say we Google it so and

157
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,320
then I realized oh applied science that

158
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,320
guy is Amazing Ben krasno um he has

159
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,120
everything you know a lot of these

160
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,340
things I search is usually just him

161
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,720
um coming up with how to do this stuff

162
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,400
at home so pretty incredible here's a

163
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,680
talk at 6 pm today I'm excited for and I

164
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,060
watched this video and and he has this

165
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,800
thing called the vacuum chamber and a

166
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,720
vacuum pump where he's sucking air out

167
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,100
so I'm like okay I gotta get one of

168
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,320
those I go on eBay I get this thing this

169
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,479
is a dual stage rotary vein we'll figure

170
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,280
out what that means later I had no idea

171
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,479
I just

172
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,039
got what he got

173
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,080
and I turned it on and I started having

174
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,639
oil just going everywhere in my kitchen

175
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,800
like what is this so I look up what I

176
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,560
need I need this oil Mist filter so

177
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,979
okay Amazon 157 so I just use a toilet

178
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,620
paper roll which this was actually early

179
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,080
covid so the going price of a toilet

180
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,680
paper was about 157 if you recall and

181
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm now trying to figure out how does

182
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,639
all this vacuum stuff work I see all all

183
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,919
these videos on Sam Zulu's Channel I

184
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,360
started recently watching this guy Nick

185
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,800
pool I know he's here and I've been

186
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,180
watching his channel recently really

187
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,780
amazing stuff there as well and I also

188
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,340
continue watching Ben's videos and he

189
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,600
does something really cool he makes

190
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,699
freeze-dried ice cream like with a

191
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,319
vacuum chamber I'm thinking okay some of

192
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,819
my projects will take me a long time

193
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,460
will take months years whatever

194
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,560
so I try doing that so I actually get

195
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,479
like a vacuum chamber I mean do I have

196
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,740
like a

197
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,539
um so I have my vacuum pump going into

198
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,220
this four line trap that's just a stop

199
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,419
let's say water and things from getting

200
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,280
back and then I have a cryo trap this is

201
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,380
like propylene glycol it's just it's the

202
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,120
stuff that you get in those packs of

203
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,940
cold when you get something in the mail

204
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,419
um and then that chamber has ice cream

205
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,800
um and I'm heating it a little bit and

206
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,060
what's really interesting about this is

207
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,400
all right so we know water water

208
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,319
generally boils at zero degrees Celsius

209
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,419
and generally freezes I'm sorry freezes

210
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,400
at zero degrees Celsius and generally

211
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,620
boils at 100 Celsius but that's only

212
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,720
true in atmosphere and what that means

213
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,580
is really this is called a phase diagram

214
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,039
so really there's water and how it when

215
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,539
it becomes a solid when it is a little

216
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:34,979
liquid and gas but there's also pressure

217
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,900
so if you change the pressure you can do

218
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,220
some cool stuff so you can actually go

219
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,319
solid turn it to ice and then you can

220
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,240
lower the pressure and then get down to

221
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,099
a gas and that's called sublimation so

222
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,900
you can turn a solid into a gas without

223
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,180
ever going into water or liquid if

224
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,860
you've ever seen dry ice you see it just

225
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,440
gassing off right that's sublimation so

226
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,759
that's one way that you can actually

227
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,560
make freeze dried ice cream I thought

228
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,419
that'd be really cool and you may hear

229
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,099
different things like atmosphere or tour

230
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,539
but normally it's really easy to figure

231
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:01,860
out all this pressure stuff all you have

232
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,360
to remember is one atmosphere is equal

233
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,419
to 1.0132 bar which is equal to 33.895

234
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,880
feet of water which is equal to 29.9213

235
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,580
inches of mercury particular 406.7825

236
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,099
inches of water which is equal to

237
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:16,380
101.325 kilopascals

238
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,919
um which is equal to 14.695 psi which is

239
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,000
760 torr or millimeters Mercury and

240
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,259
1.0332 kilograms four squared

241
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,360
centimeters unfortunately everybody uses

242
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,680
all of these different things so it's

243
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,000
really hard to calculate but just

244
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,339
memorize that you'll be good

245
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,339
um

246
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,299
so fortunately I made some type of

247
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,679
freeze-dried thing it looks gross it was

248
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,140
absolutely amazing super super rich

249
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,640
unfortunately in that process I then

250
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,620
destroyed my vacuum my vacuum pump so

251
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,880
now there's all this water I'm like okay

252
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,260
I need to open this up figure out how

253
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,540
this works and they have security screws

254
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,940
on this on the vacuum pump like they're

255
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,080
trying to prevent people from opening

256
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,779
the vacuum pump around the same time my

257
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,980
friend Stan had said hey I have this um

258
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,600
uh Mill that I'm giving away if anybody

259
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,040
wants it's just in the back of my trunk

260
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,860
hardly used like new uh unfortunately

261
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,180
that's a mill

262
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,580
so like yeah I could use a mill so I

263
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,839
take it home and I try a couple

264
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,700
different methods and evapor rust is

265
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,720
absolutely amazing I don't work for

266
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,940
evapor rust but that thing like I put

267
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,500
stuff in evapor Rust I took it out the

268
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,360
day later there's nothing

269
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,580
um really beautiful uh did a great job

270
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,740
and this is now the mill unfortunately I

271
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,240
was left with a couple of Fasteners I

272
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,519
still don't know where those go

273
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,800
but then I use the mill I have a small

274
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,740
lathe the grizzly g0765 took a piece of

275
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,880
Steel

276
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,560
um cut a little bit and just tried to

277
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,120
cut into that security screw and

278
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,920
fortunately I was able to just generate

279
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,839
something to actually open that thing so

280
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,820
I opened it up I cleaned it out and

281
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,380
that's when I learned what a rotary vein

282
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,519
is which I think is kind of interesting

283
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,200
here we can actually see what's

284
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,880
happening so I'm just manually holding

285
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,500
this with a drill those two white things

286
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,660
are the veins and rotors need rotation

287
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,519
what's happening is like if you were to

288
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,500
take something and push a balloon you're

289
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,240
gonna push that air out well it's like

290
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,279
pushing air out and while that other

291
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,380
side is expanding it's just like if you

292
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,360
were to breathe in you're expanding and

293
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,580
that air will just go go into your body

294
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,399
for example then I start getting closer

295
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,220
and closer to sputtering so this is my

296
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,440
attempt at a magnetron sputter so I'm

297
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,600
now copying more of Ben's videos and

298
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,880
other things and now I have high voltage

299
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,500
I'm using a microwave oven Transformer

300
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,360
I'm using Auto Transformer from the wall

301
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,100
so I take 140 volts and I control that

302
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,140
zero to 120. then I go into a microwave

303
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,820
oven Transformer which upset like a

304
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,399
people 70 times I go through a high

305
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,040
voltage diode and then to these two

306
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,320
sides that's a steel plate that's just

307
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,160
some like npt I don't know connectors

308
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,660
and I'm pulling vacuum on this entire

309
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,880
thing up there with high voltage and now

310
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,800
it's spraying metal or spraying

311
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,120
electrons hitting it hard enough that

312
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,380
it's spring metal and sputtering this

313
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,240
this thing unfortunately it's still not

314
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,820
doing Ito indium tin oxide

315
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,560
um I need better vacuum for that but

316
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,560
anyway I go back to all right this USB

317
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,640
thing

318
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,100
see how we're on time all right cool

319
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,060
um

320
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,160
so let's understand first why are there

321
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,720
two data lines with USB and that's

322
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,339
because the USB lines are actually

323
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,140
differential and what that means is that

324
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,360
you have if you have using Arduino you

325
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,100
might set a pin as high which let's say

326
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,980
5 volts or maybe 3.3 depending your VCC

327
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,339
or Ground Zero but really now if there's

328
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:21,899
electrical noise if there's like

329
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,640
interference somewhere then what you

330
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,740
might end up experiencing is a slight

331
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,779
variation might be 4.8 volts but the

332
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,399
Arduino the transistors inside don't

333
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,440
care they'll still see that as one or

334
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,300
high

335
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,399
now the nice thing now if there's a lot

336
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,779
of interference it might actually go low

337
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,579
you might be able to take a floating pin

338
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,680
and go high or a ground pin and go high

339
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,180
so the nice thing about an inverted or

340
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,560
differential signal like in twisted pair

341
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,839
like an Ethernet is you have you have

342
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,300
two voltages offset by something and all

343
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,380
you're looking at is the comparison of

344
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,000
these two voltages and then if there's

345
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,680
interference they both will get

346
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,820
interfered and the difference between

347
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,279
these two is still the same and we can

348
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,600
actually kind of see in returns I

349
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,220
remember a long time ago I was sitting

350
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,140
at my desk and I had these speakers on

351
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,940
my desk I'm not sure if this will work

352
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,140
but it will test real quick

353
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,300
and I remember I got a text message and

354
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,279
the speakers on my computer were making

355
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,390
noise I'm like wait why is that

356
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,940
[Music]

357
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,500
time to hear that

358
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,839
um so these are not connected to

359
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,180
anything so that's called interference

360
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,339
anyone from the FCC here

361
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,200
just curious

362
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,180
uh so that's interference I thought

363
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,560
that's that's actually pretty amazing

364
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,899
that you can produce sound on a speaker

365
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,339
that's not even connected to anything or

366
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,660
if it disconnected anything you're not

367
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,640
actually you're not actually touching it

368
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,079
you're literally wirelessly emanating

369
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,640
sound into this thing you're not using

370
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,160
sound you're using RF I thought that is

371
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,660
so cool like what else can I inject

372
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,540
sound or noise or information onto and

373
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,680
thought about keyboards those really

374
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,820
interesting keyboard so I started taking

375
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,860
a look at some general wireless

376
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,540
keyboards at first

377
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,040
a few years ago several years ago I

378
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,360
created this project called key sweeper

379
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,220
it's basically a stealthy Arduino based

380
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,660
device it looks like a charger it's

381
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,920
actually inside of an Adafruit charger

382
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,620
it has a phono board which talks to GSM

383
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,880
and whenever it's near a wireless

384
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,380
charger it sniffs and decrypts the

385
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,940
keystrokes and then produces an online

386
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,620
interface you can go to and you can

387
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,620
start typing on the keyboard wirelessly

388
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,000
fortunately the FBI released a notice

389
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,100
saying there's this Wireless keystroke

390
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,600
logger this guy is USB device charger

391
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,600
and they have the excellent additional

392
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,040
best practices to prevent a compromise

393
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,959
limit which Outlets are available for

394
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,120
device charging all right so don't let

395
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,160
people plug stuff in know whose Chargers

396
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,779
are currently being used

397
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,760
and immediate removal of an unknown

398
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,440
charger so I think I might make a new

399
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,940
one with a banana like put it inside of

400
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,620
a banana what they don't realize is the

401
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,420
circuit inside can go in anything it

402
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,100
doesn't have to be a charger so soon

403
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,300
it'll be limit which bananas are

404
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,579
available uh no whose bananas are

405
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:45,660
currently being used and immediate

406
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,279
removal of an unknown banana from the

407
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,779
office

408
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,600
uh okay so I thought all right wireless

409
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,040
keyboards that's interesting that makes

410
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,180
sense if you can attack the wireless

411
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,040
communication there's already RF between

412
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,040
your computer or a USB dongle and the

413
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,420
keyboard itself but what about a

414
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,220
physical keyboard inside of a keyboard

415
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,720
you have something called a scan Matrix

416
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,579
basically if you have 100 keys on a

417
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:06,839
keyboard you don't want to have 100 pins

418
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,339
on your microcontroller so it's best

419
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,839
better to use the scan Matrix where you

420
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,120
can actually share pins and the

421
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,380
interesting part about this is that

422
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,180
there's also diodes on every pin that

423
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,000
that prevents key ghosting uh so I

424
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,100
thought okay well in a keyboard if you

425
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,600
actually look at the keyboard the wires

426
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,940
are all different lengths so could I

427
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,740
just measure all the wire lengths and

428
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,300
what is the length of a wire well for

429
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,040
one all wires are conduct are all

430
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,279
conductors are antennas and what is the

431
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,600
wavelength of an antenna or the

432
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,040
frequency it's related to a physical

433
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,680
length of a wire so if you measure all

434
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,060
of those then you actually now know the

435
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,380
wavelength the resonant frequency of

436
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,180
every single key on a keyboard so could

437
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,980
I inject that I'm not sure if that would

438
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,019
work and just to learn a little bit more

439
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,279
about RF

440
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,440
so I started doing this I found it was

441
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,540
not working I got a little bit of luck

442
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,899
on on a mouse but once I got to let's

443
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,699
see where we're at all right cool

444
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:57,839
all right

445
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,399
um once I got to

446
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,019
trying to inject on my keyboard it

447
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,339
wasn't working so like okay I don't

448
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,139
really understand what's happening if I

449
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,600
touch my oscilloscope to the keyboard

450
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,060
itself I now change everything about the

451
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,040
way that I change the impedance and I I

452
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,959
can't measure it that way so I actually

453
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,399
have to really probably just understand

454
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,040
RF better so one thing that I started to

455
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,139
learn was RF this is a highly scientific

456
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,120
chart from XKCD about the

457
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,740
electromagnetic spectrum so radio

458
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,139
frequency RF is just one part of the

459
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,399
electromagnetic spectrum and I think

460
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,360
it's actually really helpful to

461
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,339
understand because visible light the

462
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:30,899
light that we see is also part of

463
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,279
electromagnetic spectrum it's actually

464
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,459
helpful for me to think about basically

465
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:38,399
all radio waves as all radio waves as

466
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,199
light right I can now think of

467
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,959
everything as light and all waves have

468
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,399
the same properties they have reflection

469
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,380
they have absorption refraction

470
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,779
diffraction

471
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:50,100
and as I'm learning about radio waves

472
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,480
they also have very clever names like

473
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,000
low frequency medium frequency high

474
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,639
frequency very high frequency extremely

475
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,320
high frequency I'm sorry ultra high

476
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,420
frequency super high frequency extremely

477
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,920
high frequency

478
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,079
and then far infrared and that's when

479
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,760
you use it infrared and then light

480
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,459
visible light ultraviolet x-rays gamma

481
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,139
rays Etc I don't know if there's

482
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,639
anything after that

483
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,800
but that's pretty interesting

484
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,120
so I'm trying to learn about this and

485
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
okay I want to understand if I want to

486
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,000
understand how a packet works or if I

487
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,959
want to change some networking I

488
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,000
understand how packet works if I

489
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,680
understand ethernet then I need to

490
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,360
understand or CAT5 I'm just doing

491
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,820
voltage so here I need to look up how RF

492
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,440
Works which is how electromagnetism

493
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,180
Works which is how light works so I

494
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,399
start looking up what light is and that

495
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,899
just starts talking about photons on

496
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,360
Wikipedia like hey what's a photon and

497
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,259
then I start reading about this thing

498
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,880
called wave particle duality and this is

499
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,800
just like blowing my mind so apparently

500
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,420
like I always thought of light as these

501
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,920
particles right these little dots that

502
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,380
you can fly and send this is called uh

503
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,579
this right here is called the double

504
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,440
slit experiment so this is a double

505
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,240
slides which is my living room I took a

506
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,699
plain laser green laser I go through

507
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,920
this double slit here I would expect to

508
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,680
see two lines on the end on the other

509
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,720
side of the room instead we see this

510
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,899
like up down up of the high low high low

511
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,640
high low that's called an interference

512
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,699
pattern so literally the laser going

513
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,799
through that two lines creates this

514
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,500
pattern what does that mean and now

515
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,240
another way to thinking about this and

516
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,220
people have done great demonstrations of

517
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,720
using water like if you actually have

518
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,000
water a water wave go through a dam and

519
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,459
you have two slits in that Dam now two

520
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,500
new waves will come out and then they'll

521
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,480
interfere and those waves they have

522
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,520
Peaks and troughs right so now those

523
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,320
Peaks and troughs will interfere their

524
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,299
potassium did a good job of explaining

525
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:34,559
this so here's a video that you can

526
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,640
check out

527
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,799
so now I'm just I'm fascinated by Optics

528
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,780
and that this stuff can actually work so

529
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,220
I start looking online like how do I do

530
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,900
opposite experiments at home I find 3D

531
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,340
like you can find optomechanical

532
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,500
equipment you just 3D print at home and

533
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,020
start building yeah buy buy your lenses

534
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,080
or mirrors from Thor Labs

535
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,640
admin Optics online eBay wherever you

536
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,679
want

537
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,020
um and I'm really curious now about this

538
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,820
Photon thing because there's another

539
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,080
thing with the double slit experiment

540
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,120
with like let's say we have light like

541
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,980
let's say we're sunglasses and let's say

542
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,419
they're The Aviator type or very

543
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,120
reflective and 50 of light goes through

544
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,700
50 of light reflects off

545
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,400
what happens when you send one photon

546
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,799
to your sunglasses does it go through or

547
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,200
does it go or does it reflect that's

548
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,940
that's actually a pretty interesting

549
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,640
question so there's actually a lot of

550
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,140
research that's been happening 30 40

551
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,240
years ago about what happens with single

552
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,919
particles like photons and electrons

553
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,660
what happens when they interfere when

554
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,880
they do one thing and apparently

555
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,980
supposedly they do both they actually

556
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,780
this is called the quantum superposition

557
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,820
now this is blowing my mind even more so

558
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,500
what actually happens is supposedly it

559
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,140
will go through both it will reflect and

560
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,120
it will go through and how do you know

561
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,220
that and you know that because according

562
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,260
to papers when you reintroduce them

563
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,240
through another let's say beam splitter

564
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,000
sunglasses you can then learn you'll

565
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,200
learn you'll actually see it on one side

566
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,880
of a beam splitter if one side is

567
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,200
blocked you'll actually end up seeing it

568
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,460
on the other side of the beam splitter

569
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,760
if the actual Photon went that direction

570
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,440
there's papers on this we won't get into

571
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,360
this if you can't unfortunately there's

572
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,860
lots of open papers that you can access

573
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,380
online but there's something called the

574
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,299
elter waveman bomb tester experiment

575
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:13,679
which also was first a thought

576
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,360
experiment around this and said that you

577
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,220
if you created a photosensitive bomb

578
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,380
that would explode when it detected a

579
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,140
photon you can in some cases detect that

580
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,059
there's a bomb there it will explode if

581
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,400
the photon ever gets sent and you can

582
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,260
learn that that is there without ever

583
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,020
having a photon actually hit it this is

584
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,160
pretty amazing because this could mean

585
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,480
that could you do the same thing with

586
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,700
that tray if an x-ray is a photon then

587
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,140
couldn't you Double Split couldn't you

588
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,539
split an x-ray into hit a human with a

589
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,000
superposition the X-ray continues down

590
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,400
another path you re-merge them and then

591
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,140
you now learn information this is called

592
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,820
the witch path information did it go

593
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,559
this way or not so I'm like all right I

594
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,880
have to try to understand some of this

595
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,900
Quantum stuff

596
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,059
um I don't know if I can but I'll try

597
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,799
so I start looking what experiments can

598
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,539
I do at home and I find this book called

599
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:58,860
exploring quantum physics through

600
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,419
Hands-On projects like that sounds

601
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,400
amazing and I look at the authors David

602
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,940
perucci and Shani prucci and I find that

603
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,160
Shanny Shawnee excuse me uh

604
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,960
it did a supercon talk actually there's

605
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,000
a couple super gone talks so I just

606
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,559
tweeted I remember I was like oh my God

607
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,840
you're a biggest fan

608
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,000
um and we started chatting and I got the

609
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,020
book and I just started going through

610
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,640
some of their experiments like this is

611
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,260
actually really cool I really do suggest

612
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,280
this book

613
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,080
um because you can do a ton of stuff at

614
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,340
home and so it's really really

615
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,020
incredible because if people are doing

616
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,580
quantum mechanical experiments 30 years

617
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,260
ago 40 years ago think about how much

618
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,880
technology has progressed since then and

619
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,039
what we're able to do at home

620
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,780
um so now I'm learning about photo tubes

621
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,039
photo tubes are actually super

622
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,020
interesting because they're a they're

623
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,059
extremely simple all it is is you let's

624
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,440
say a piece of glass and you have two

625
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,760
pieces of metal inside and there's a

626
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,280
vacuum and if light of a certain energy

627
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,320
hits it so if you have let's say blue

628
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,820
light or ultraviolet light hit something

629
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,679
like zinc it will then emit electrons

630
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,419
and those electrons will hit the other

631
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,860
piece of metal and then conduct a

632
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,840
current and now you have a current and

633
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,059
if you send let's say red light instead

634
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,980
you get nothing if you send a thousand

635
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,840
times the red light at the same time you

636
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,460
get nothing and that just showed that

637
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,559
light was also at times quantized so we

638
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,000
saw it as a way when we did the double

639
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,320
slit experiment but now we see it as

640
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,360
single particles with a with some amount

641
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,640
of energy so this is like this is

642
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,380
absolutely crazy I want to make one of

643
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,400
these

644
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,620
how do I make a photo tube so it's glass

645
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,720
it's metal well I can just make pieces

646
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,039
of metal like I can take pieces of metal

647
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,900
and cut it or bend it but I don't know

648
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,980
how to mess with glass so I start

649
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,240
googling how do you make how do you make

650
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,340
glass like how do you actually I don't

651
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,740
know make the photo tubes so I find this

652
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,820
book called building scientific

653
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,500
apparatus and amazingly it's on

654
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,360
archive.org for free so you can access

655
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,919
the full book there there's a full

656
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,380
chapter working with glass so this is

657
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,200
very exciting the properties of glass

658
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,659
what you need tubings rods Etc and the

659
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,520
glass doors tools so I get the very

660
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,320
basic tool set so this is a national

661
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,900
torch and then you need a fuel I use

662
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,000
propane you also want oxygen for

663
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,039
borosilicate you want borosilicate glass

664
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,780
like Pyrex and the reason for that is

665
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,659
that you're going to use a lot of heat

666
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:01,740
and you don't want the glass to break

667
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,760
it's like

668
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,740
it's easier to use in some cases and

669
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,140
harder to use in some cases anyway I was

670
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,460
like I'm not going to pay for oxygen

671
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,919
like I breathe oxygen every day

672
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,840
um can I just like take it and

673
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,919
apparently most of the air is actually

674
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,840
nitrogen so I'm like 80 nitrogen maybe

675
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,940
90 oxygen something like that so you can

676
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,919
actually get one of these uh oxygen

677
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,539
concentrators so this if you have

678
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,039
emphysema you might have one of these or

679
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,659
you can find them on Craigslist

680
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:25,740
um and I was looking like can I just

681
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,600
produce the oxygen myself and I found

682
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,640
more more actually people on a Discord

683
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,860
called vacuum hack sores helped me and

684
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,900
said oh this is all you need to do get

685
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,880
an oilless compressor so that you're not

686
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,799
spitting out oil which takes in the air

687
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,419
compresses it and then you put it

688
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,740
through a couple of things you put it

689
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,900
through a silica gel like a desiccant

690
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,760
that gets rid of the humidity then you

691
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,840
put it through a couple of particulate

692
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,280
filters just to get rid of any dust or

693
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,419
anything and then you put it through

694
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,460
something called the molecular sieve and

695
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,659
this is actually the same thing as the

696
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,039
silica gel that you might find in your

697
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,020
vitamin packets right that's silica gel

698
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,640
how does that work it's really just

699
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,500
these balls of silica and they have

700
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,880
holes in them on the outside kind of

701
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,340
like a golf ball and those holes are the

702
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,919
size of water molecules so it's really

703
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,640
adsorbing a d not absorbing but

704
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,260
adsorbing and you can do that you can

705
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,820
get other things called other sieves

706
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,220
like zeolite and there's various kinds

707
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,720
that will actually collect or absorb

708
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,159
different gases so you can say I want to

709
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,440
get I want to collect nitrogen I want to

710
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,179
adsorb nitrogen so the oxygen then

711
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:22,860
continues to go out and then you can put

712
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,240
that in a buffer tank and then you can

713
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,799
compress that further if you want and

714
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,539
spit it out too whatever you want so you

715
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,020
just make oxygen at home or nitrogen

716
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,580
so now I have everything and I have made

717
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,580
fire it's absolutely amazing uh so

718
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,539
now I'm continuing and I'm trying to

719
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,220
make I'm just trying this stuff at home

720
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,720
I'm trying to make these different

721
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,900
connections and like teas and ring seals

722
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,000
and every time I make something like I

723
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,200
kind of kind of got it kind of got it

724
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,880
half an hour goes by and I hear it break

725
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,220
my kitchen like okay what am I doing

726
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,840
wrong and I try it again and I try it

727
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,600
again it just keeps breaking so then I'm

728
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,700
like okay well maybe I maybe I need to

729
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,820
go take a class or something and uh

730
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,940
uh after after literally weeks every

731
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,440
weekend I would just spend trying to

732
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,299
make some glass I just went chapter by

733
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,700
chapter by chapter in this book and the

734
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,320
second to last chapter says annealing

735
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,059
even when a seal is carefully blown out

736
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,320
to give it a uniform wall thickness

737
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,580
harmful stresses or inevitably frozen

738
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,740
into the glass work glass must be

739
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,120
annealed by heating to a temperature

740
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,679
above the annealing point so I learned I

741
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,480
was doing it wrong the whole time I need

742
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,000
to anneal so I continued now I tried

743
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,860
annealing and I still found that a lot

744
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,360
of things that I was doing weren't

745
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,299
working so uh I then found a local class

746
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,419
on on lampworking and glassblowing um in

747
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:39,179
La so I went to this class unfortunately

748
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,679
they're doing soft glass I had trouble

749
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,360
finding anyone who would teach how to do

750
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,179
borosilicate or scientific glass so I

751
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,559
went to this class anyway I learned a

752
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,419
few things but my stuff at home still

753
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,039
didn't work so I can you just search

754
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,080
online scientific glass blowing borrow

755
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,760
silica glass blowing can I find anyone

756
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,320
who's doing this kind of thing that I

757
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,580
could just pay to teach me for a few

758
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,020
hours right it's the same thing as a

759
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,240
class I found this guy on Instagram he

760
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,860
has a lot of beautiful glass work he

761
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,679
also had like a lot of oregano or basil

762
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,960
or something in a lot of his images I

763
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,860
think he likes uh yeah not sure but uh I

764
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,120
asked him as like you know you can't

765
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,500
really come to my shop

766
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,240
um I just started messaging more and

767
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,220
more people on Instagram on Google on

768
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,299
YouTube

769
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:19,620
um then I just went to LinkedIn I

770
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,299
searched scientific glass blower and I

771
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:22,679
just started messaging literally copying

772
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,700
and pasting my message to everyone

773
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,140
people didn't respond um some people

774
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,179
like you can't come to my work and I

775
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:31,860
can't like teach you right I have a job

776
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,860
like the scientific Glasper and finally

777
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,600
I get someone who responds this person

778
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,580
works at Sigma Aldrich owned by Merck I

779
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,080
mean legit company it's been assigned of

780
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,820
a glassware for a long time and she says

781
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,140
oh I see that you're in L.A we're

782
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,659
located in Milwaukee Wisconsin this is

783
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:46,679
something that you're thinking you would

784
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,299
travel here for

785
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,700
it's time to check in

786
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,100
and the great thing is that tickets to

787
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,480
Wisconsin in the middle of winter are

788
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,940
super cheap I think I think they paid me

789
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,320
actually

790
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,539
and I arrived I was very excited to uh

791
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,340
get to this place and now here's the

792
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,360
thing she's I think she was very

793
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,679
suspicious she was like okay well is

794
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,240
this kind of legit like you're gonna

795
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,980
have to send me you know six hours up

796
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,720
front pay me pay me after I was like

797
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,460
that seems sounds reasonable so I sent

798
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,440
her the money via Paypal got the ticket

799
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,900
flew out there I show up knocked on you

800
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,400
know if I get an Uber I stayed at a

801
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,039
hotel and I show up and I say knock on

802
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,600
the door old woman comes to the door and

803
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,059
says hi is Katie or Ian there she's like

804
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:28,580
nobody here by that name I'm like what

805
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,720
I checked the address I'm like is this

806
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,159
the address you're like yep that's the

807
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,260
address like oh no

808
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,900
and I call I call Katie I have her phone

809
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,820
number we've never spoken before I've

810
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,940
just given her money on the internet

811
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,919
and like I met this address it was like

812
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,799
oh oh I have the number switch sorry uh

813
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,659
hold on come outside and I see her like

814
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:52,400
10 10 houses down like okay

815
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,380
it was so cold

816
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,480
I was so cold I live in you know I live

817
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,980
here in L.A and I thought okay I'll just

818
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,600
bring four layers and that's just that

819
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,340
doesn't do it like it's the wrong kind

820
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,020
of layers I guess you need a windbreaker

821
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,640
or something I don't know

822
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,580
freezing so I show up at the shop and

823
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,440
I'm like I'm so excited so these two

824
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,880
guys Ian and Katie and they're actually

825
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,320
they're incredible so they're teaching

826
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,539
they've this is Ian's Workshop this is

827
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:18,179
home workshop and he has this glass

828
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,159
lathe um absolutely amazing makes it

829
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,200
really easy just a few pictures of their

830
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,179
lab here

831
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:27,659
uh this is a pretty sweet uh

832
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,539
this is a torch that Ian made so this is

833
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,820
fully fully glass besides the two needle

834
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,860
valves so one needle valve allows you to

835
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,360
put in something like butane and then

836
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,539
one allows it to go go out and then use

837
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:42,179
the Venturi effect to add additional air

838
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,860
through the back and you get this torch

839
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,440
and that's super sweet and this is uh

840
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,500
Katie in her lightsaber and you're the

841
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,360
the blue or the Purple Haze that's

842
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,000
actually basically the geodimian glasses

843
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,059
that you wear to a c much better and it

844
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,980
removes all of the yellow sodium Flair

845
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,600
when you're working so when you're glass

846
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,980
blowing or lampworking you really want

847
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,900
to wear that so hey you can see better

848
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,820
so this is a if you ever want to reach

849
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,720
out to them if you want to fly to

850
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,640
Wisconsin they'll they now teach

851
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,580
personal classes

852
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,720
and while I was out there I realized you

853
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,340
know I was actually I've been talking to

854
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,980
this guy on Twitter um Michael Katz he's

855
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,679
a professor at and I realize oh yeah

856
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,200
he's in Wisconsin so I said hey he's an

857
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,760
Optics Professor he's an Optics lab out

858
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,659
there I'm like can I take you to lunch

859
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,120
he's like yeah you know come by also my

860
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,340
wife is Jennifer you know Dr Jennifer

861
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,080
Troy Professor Jennifer Choi and she has

862
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,120
a Quantum lab I'm like wait I'm gonna go

863
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,120
visit an Optics lab in a Quantum lab

864
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,980
um so I got to go hang out with them and

865
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,440
of course Professor Toby

866
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,320
um and just I blew my mind I I haven't

867
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,539
gone to like a school or university so I

868
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:46,679
haven't seen the types of stuff that

869
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,140
they're doing this is a Magneto Optical

870
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,840
oh man a Mott not a microwave oven

871
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,940
Transformer Magneto Optical trap where

872
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,220
they're actually able to cool down atoms

873
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,820
neutral atoms with a laser and trap it

874
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,600
that blows my mind so I fly home really

875
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,860
and reinvigorated on this like

876
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,140
glassblowing stuff and I'm thinking I

877
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,880
need to do little projects as I'm

878
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,380
working on progressing on larger

879
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,760
projects so I thought it'd be cool maybe

880
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,320
I do a little art project I make like a

881
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,539
little neon sign or something

882
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:16,919
um because I can I think I can do that

883
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,840
now um I think I understand enough about

884
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,659
vacuum and gas and glass blowing and

885
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,159
actually neon signs are really they're

886
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,399
called gas discharge tubes so neon signs

887
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,720
what that means is that there's neon

888
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,760
inside most of the tubes you see don't

889
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,740
actually have neon inside so some are

890
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,380
helium or argon or Krypton or Xenon so

891
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,000
typically the noble gases and sometimes

892
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,340
you can you can add things like mercury

893
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,140
vapor and that will also alter the color

894
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,179
so we can see a couple of the colors

895
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,640
here so that's pretty interesting like

896
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,559
that'd be cool to have a neon sign on my

897
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,059
wall like it could actually just be the

898
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:51,059
the noble gases like argon neon

899
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,860
Etc

900
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,600
and how does that work I was just

901
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,000
curious so the way that's what my

902
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,440
understanding is when you have a neon

903
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,480
tube you have two pieces of metal two of

904
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,799
metal electrodes and then you're putting

905
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,320
High volt high voltage on those um I

906
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,820
assume it'll work with these with both

907
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,679
DC and AC but I think AC will actually

908
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,600
look better and what it's producing is

909
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,100
this huge electric field not huge

910
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,840
electric field like electric field if

911
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,640
there's ever any electron in there that

912
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,320
electron is going to get pushed by that

913
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,240
field or pulled

914
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,399
and if that electron hits a neutral atom

915
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,980
like an atom of neon that neutral atom

916
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,059
is not doing anything it's just hanging

917
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,340
out and if it hits it hard enough well

918
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,899
what will happen is an electron will fly

919
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:30,179
off and if that electron flies off and

920
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,340
hits and then joins another atom that

921
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,659
has already had an electron fly off

922
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:36,600
light is produced that energy base gets

923
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,159
converted to light now you need that

924
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,480
electric field you need the vacuum

925
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,580
because you need enough space for that

926
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,620
electron to actually Traverse so I think

927
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,600
of it like if I'm if I'm in a parallel

928
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,640
parked car and just slam on the throttle

929
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,260
I'm just going to hit the car in front

930
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,960
of me slightly but if I'm on the street

931
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,520
and I have a lot of space and I

932
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,140
accelerate I'm going to gain more and

933
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,940
more speed right force is equal to mass

934
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,559
times acceleration my Mass is the same

935
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,360
but I'm accelerating so I'm going to

936
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,740
have a lot more Force when I finally hit

937
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,000
it and I'm going to eject the person

938
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,799
from that car and they're going to hit

939
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,659
another car and as long as they're a

940
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:07,860
magnetic field and they're wearing like

941
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,240
a steel suit they're they're probably

942
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,740
going to eject someone else and

943
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,380
the whole thing will keep going so I

944
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,820
thought well it'd be really interesting

945
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,320
if I could actually have this on my wall

946
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,000
and not have wires because I don't like

947
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,679
wires so I try to remove any wires on

948
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,779
the walls like you know my TV or Xbox or

949
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,880
whatever wires so I remember that I saw

950
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,380
a fluorescent tube light up a long time

951
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,539
ago and those from a Tesla coil so I got

952
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,039
one of these like little Tesla coils on

953
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,299
Amazon

954
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:32,279
um and I might start googling like how

955
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,840
do these work what's a Tesla coil and

956
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,460
how can I make my own

957
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,440
um and as I'm Googling I actually see I

958
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,360
find out this guy Jay

959
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,500
um who I had the opportunity to meet

960
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,480
last night so check out his channel he's

961
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,399
also doing a talk tomorrow at 11AM so

962
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,899
I'm pretty excited about that so

963
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:47,520
learning a lot about Tesla coils from

964
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,100
him also go on to a Discord for Tesla

965
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,559
coils talking to a bunch of people

966
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,500
um I meet uh this uh someone named Tate

967
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,820
and he we're chatting oh hell no I did

968
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,240
not just get the plasma Tour on let's go

969
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,520
dude oh my God

970
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,399
so Tate's here so he recorded this in my

971
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,840
home he's trying to like he's working on

972
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,600
Tesla coils like crazy Mad stuff like

973
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,320
this

974
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,399
um and he needs equipment I'm like just

975
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,200
come over whenever you want and use my

976
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,220
equipment

977
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,659
um don't destroy my oscilloscope and

978
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:27,059
still scoop still works uh so he's doing

979
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:28,740
crazy stuff so I'm just I'm excited to

980
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,020
just be around that type of energy this

981
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,059
is his channel check it out as you can

982
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,980
see he's doing incredible stuff

983
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,600
um also a shout out and thank you to

984
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,980
Scotty for pushing me to actually do

985
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,960
this talk here because I wasn't going to

986
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,240
but uh we hung out and he convinced me

987
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,720
to so excited uh for his stuff so I

988
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,679
started learning about something called

989
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,539
a Slayer Exciter circuit and this is

990
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:49,740
actually really really interesting this

991
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,539
is a the simplistic circuit so that's

992
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:52,679
very helpful for me I'm not an

993
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,779
electrical engineer

994
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,419
um so this is my Slayer Exciter it's no

995
00:32:57,419 --> 00:32:59,520
different than many others um this is

996
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,960
just a bypass capacitor that's a store

997
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,779
energy so we can ignore that for now and

998
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,039
just understand like briefly what's

999
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,020
happening basically VCC that's our

1000
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,940
voltage there are 10 I put in say 12

1001
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,640
volts 12 volts uh

1002
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,919
can go through this resistor R2 and then

1003
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,360
go through the base of that transistor

1004
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,299
that's an npn and npn transistors is a

1005
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,279
switch right it turns on or off so going

1006
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,960
voltage going to the base turns it on

1007
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,059
which allows voltage or I'm sorry

1008
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,460
current to go from BCC from our battery

1009
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,399
or whatever through that inductor L3 now

1010
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:30,840
whenever you have current when you have

1011
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,039
a Charged particle moving through

1012
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:34,860
something it creates a perpendicular

1013
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,600
magnetic field so now there's a

1014
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,980
perpendicular magnetic field like going

1015
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,260
around this inductor inductor is just a

1016
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,120
coil like this

1017
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,760
so now that that happens the same thing

1018
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,480
it reverse happens with L4 L4 now says I

1019
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,220
feel this magnetic field and produces a

1020
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,360
current

1021
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,860
um and that current actually then shuts

1022
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,340
off the base and which then turns off L3

1023
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,260
which then turns off that field and now

1024
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,820
you get this oscillator this natural

1025
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,980
oscillator which is really really cool I

1026
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,419
thought okay maybe I can put like a

1027
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:04,980
Tesla coil in my wall and then I can

1028
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,299
light up the neon sign and I won't have

1029
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:07,740
electrodes in the neon sign it'll just

1030
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,199
be like they'll just be lit and then I

1031
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,839
asked uh Sam someone I work with

1032
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,580
um hey do you know of like any way that

1033
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,260
can do a flat Tesla coil and he's going

1034
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,418
to link me to this thank you Sam that's

1035
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:20,280
him hard at work

1036
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,739
uh so I get this so we'll find this flat

1037
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,060
test like one that makes a lot of sense

1038
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,859
so this is called the pancake coil where

1039
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:28,260
you essentially have your primary coil

1040
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,418
on the outside here

1041
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:32,280
um and the secondary which is here I

1042
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,560
have about 140 turns to one um so what

1043
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,239
that means is if I put one volt in I'm

1044
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,980
going to about approximately 140 volts

1045
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,679
on the out on the outside I used Eagle I

1046
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,199
found a ulp to create spiral coils it

1047
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,940
only got up to 100 turns so you just go

1048
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,379
into the code and you literally make it

1049
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,599
200 and now you can go higher I tried

1050
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,520
producing them at home I tried ferric

1051
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,800
chloride I use like spray paint on pcbs

1052
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,739
and that wasn't working and it's around

1053
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,240
this time that I'm messing with this

1054
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,760
project that uh crash space had a

1055
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,339
wearable Wednesday with our favorite Liz

1056
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:05,460
here she's also doing a talk today 5 p.m

1057
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,859
here excited for that actually that's

1058
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,119
wearable Wednesday is where I met

1059
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,480
Deborah geek mom projects and she's a

1060
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,560
machine I don't know if you've seen her

1061
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,660
Twitter it's just so many so many

1062
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,520
amazing projects um she is absolutely a

1063
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,040
machine like literally uses a cybernetic

1064
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,200
organ ISM with living tissue over metal

1065
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,020
endoskeleton uh so I was like it would

1066
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,220
be cool to have some type of a wearable

1067
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,079
thing for wearable Wednesday so thought

1068
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,579
okay instead of you know I could put

1069
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,740
that PCB inside I don't know I could

1070
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,359
like have a have a Tesla coil with me

1071
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,460
but could I make it on a flex circuit

1072
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,140
what is a flex circuit well a flexor

1073
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,940
could have just capped on tape

1074
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,000
um not Capcom tape but capped on tape

1075
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,339
and kept on tape with copper that's

1076
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,859
that's all really Flex circuit is and I

1077
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:48,180
started messing around can I make this

1078
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,980
at home I started Googling like what is

1079
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,480
like actually what is tapped on tape

1080
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,520
it's a polyamide tape and this website

1081
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,960
says that the polymer tape has a strong

1082
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,880
taste and a sour smell

1083
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,760
the polymy tape is likely to be fake

1084
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,800
so that's how you know if you have fake

1085
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,700
polymide tape by The Taste thank you

1086
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,579
hopeflightcn.com

1087
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,920
so I tried a couple things but finally I

1088
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,079
went to pcbgo.com I sent them my board

1089
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,000
they sent me this

1090
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,900
um actually I think I have one

1091
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,900
so this is now I think as far as I know

1092
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,180
the first flexible wearable uh Tesla

1093
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,320
coil

1094
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,099
um

1095
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,099
then I now need to make like an actual

1096
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,900
ampule or something to actually carry a

1097
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,240
gas so I've now been improving my vacuum

1098
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,980
setup I'm using all these npt gauges but

1099
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,140
I have a ton of leaks and then I've now

1100
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,240
switched to KF so MPT these are just

1101
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,040
like things you use for pipe fittings

1102
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,500
um KF is quick flange it's just a it's a

1103
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,660
better higher vacuum connector for all

1104
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,460
all these connections basically this is

1105
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,500
a scroll pump I got rid of the the oil

1106
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,240
pump uh I just didn't like dealing with

1107
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,760
all this oil uh so now scroll pump I go

1108
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,859
through a valve I can turn on or shut

1109
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:00,540
off the vacuum it goes through this like

1110
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,420
four-way T this cross I can bring it to

1111
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,980
Atmosphere I have a valve that's now

1112
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,780
going to that balloon that's my breath

1113
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,300
so just blow into the balloon put my

1114
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,740
breath in there I have desiccant there

1115
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,140
to remove humidity from my breath and

1116
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,720
that way I can now pump my breath I can

1117
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,119
pull vacuum from a piece of glass at the

1118
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:21,240
bottom here the mks-91p that's just a

1119
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,800
pro it's a pressure gauge the pressure

1120
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,720
sensor and then I just break out cereal

1121
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,160
and I have a little analog voltmeter on

1122
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,079
there so I can see the voltage so I can

1123
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,480
basically pump down pull out all of the

1124
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,839
air from this glass tube then I can turn

1125
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,060
off the vacuum or actually prevent

1126
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,040
anything else from being pulled out and

1127
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,960
then I can open up that needle valve and

1128
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,060
allow my breath to go into this and I

1129
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,260
can control the pressure because there's

1130
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,400
a needle valve and I'm monitoring the

1131
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,079
pressure there and then I can use the

1132
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,700
Tesla coil near it to see will it light

1133
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,940
up and once I do that

1134
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,960
here's the full setup and so I have

1135
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,520
basically I have a scroll pump I have

1136
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,460
the book right next to me I have very

1137
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,380
little space to cook eggs anymore but

1138
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,560
that's okay who needs a kitchen this was

1139
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,560
the first successful actual ampoule and

1140
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,780
uh I think because I had put my breath

1141
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,640
in there Sam insisted that I had blew

1142
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,599
myself

1143
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,280
I'm not sure that's entirely true but

1144
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,680
yeah that's what he says and uh that's

1145
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,599
actually let's let's see if this thing

1146
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,960
works

1147
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,680
don't mind the Giant heatsink in my

1148
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,700
pocket

1149
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,619
um so here we have like the actual uh

1150
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,720
ampule as you can see

1151
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,099
and here's like a different one

1152
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:39,770
not too hard to see on the uh

1153
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,110
[Applause]

1154
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,680
right no batteries nothing else just

1155
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,960
piece of glass different uh different

1156
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,960
gases will produce different um

1157
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,579
and I know you'll really want to see

1158
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,740
what's down there

1159
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,920
so that's all you need a little coil

1160
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,040
and uh just some quick things

1161
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,300
um here I take a little clear camera I

1162
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,500
was just curious to see like what it

1163
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,000
looked like um you can actually see this

1164
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,640
torb oil or donut shape it pretty what's

1165
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,020
interesting to me is that it really only

1166
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,000
lights up at the edges

1167
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,500
um so you can kind of see like in the

1168
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,960
center it will not but down here it will

1169
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,980
um I thought that was pretty interesting

1170
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,760
and also uh this is just while making it

1171
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,980
so here another you can kind of see the

1172
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,140
shape a little bit of that field which

1173
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,359
is which I think is kind of cool just

1174
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,980
the rest of the components used I just

1175
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,960
took three lithium cells the 18650

1176
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,220
batteries put a battery management

1177
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,660
circuit on it because I kept putting

1178
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,099
lithium cells without battery management

1179
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:36,540
circuits and I'd wear it for a couple

1180
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,220
hours the voltage would go down to like

1181
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,140
2.5 volts and then I'd destroy the

1182
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,579
battery just kept doing that because I

1183
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,140
was lazy

1184
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,820
um I use a voltage regulator as a buck

1185
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,640
regulator

1186
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,960
and that basically takes my voltage

1187
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,760
let's say you have three cells you'll be

1188
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,440
at I don't know 12.6 volts or something

1189
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,180
like that that brings it down to

1190
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,980
something like I bring it to town to

1191
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,540
about 10 volts because I unfortunately I

1192
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,280
have to have this giant heat aluminum

1193
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,440
heat sink with a transistor on top so

1194
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,700
that's in my pocket and it's just

1195
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,540
getting hotter and hotter and hotter

1196
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,280
and that's uh that's the rest of it it's

1197
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,020
just a Slayer Exciter with these three

1198
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,000
components and thank you so much for

1199
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,240
coming

1200
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,790
all right

1201
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:23,989
