1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,390
awesome thanks thank you everybody and

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,550
thanks hackaday for having me out this

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,170
cannot believe this is my first Super

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,080
Con I've never like actually made it out

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,280
here everyone's like you got to go to

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,770
super cons so I'm finally here I'm very

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,090
excited to see what everybody else is

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,100
working on but before I can do that I

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,460
have to give my talk so so without any

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,430
further ado let's talk about my stuff

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,949
yeah boggling the board house let's make

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,520
weird stuff out of pcbs a quick aside a

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,620
little introduction this is my twitter

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,219
bio why write a bio slide when I worked

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,820
so hard on Twitter 3 3 big takeaways

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,190
from this one I'm an electrical engineer

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,800
for sparkfun I've been there for nine

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,140
years in March that's crazy

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,640
- I wear Berets on ironically three I

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,850
like to make weird stuff and so today

21
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,989
we're gonna talk about making weird

22
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,449
stuff pretty much exclusively out of

23
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,690
pcbs and it turns out the cornerstone of

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,510
this knowledge is actually drawing weird

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,760
shapes in your eda if you're not

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,770
familiar with the term UDA electronic

27
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,960
design automation it's you know your

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,000
your your eagle your kicad Altium if

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,890
you're nasty and yeah so it's basically

30
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,880
whatever you use for your schematic

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,290
capture and your board layout we're

32
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,430
gonna be talking mostly about board

33
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,320
layout I'm gonna be referencing Eagle a

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,450
lot because it's what I use at spark

35
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,280
funds so it's what I end up using for

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,320
most of my personal projects although a

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,299
lot of this knowledge is pretty general

38
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,640
you can use it in kicad or whatever else

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,360
you're working with so what do I mean by

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,979
weird shapes well basically anything

41
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,720
other than a rectangle right so the

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,490
drawing tools in your EDA are basically

43
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,460
made to draw rectangles and if you want

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,409
anything else in there you pretty much

45
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,090
have to use an external tool to pull in

46
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,799
some art from somewhere else and there

47
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,390
are three really popular ways you can do

48
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,100
that the first is to use a tool called

49
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,920
SVG to eagle which is very useful if you

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,380
happen to have vector graphics the

51
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,840
second is a tool called Buzzard which is

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,000
useful if you have bitmap graphics and

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,619
then the third way is to just not use

54
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,010
either of those and it

55
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,290
draw it which I don't suggest at all

56
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,500
except for in like very few specialized

57
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,530
cases so the first thing is we GT Eagle

58
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,510
this is by this is a tool written by

59
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,360
Gordon Williams it is a free open-source

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,170
tool

61
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,079
I believe it's under the MIT license it

62
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,150
might be under the GPL anyway free and

63
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,870
open source tool you might know Gordon

64
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,879
Williams as the developer behind Esper

65
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,040
we know also quick shout out I think

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,420
he's got a Kickstarter going on right

67
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,359
now for an open hackable wearable a

68
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:46,720
watch Smart Watch it's called bangle

69
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,989
so maybe check that out anyway SPG Eagle

70
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:52,720
does what it says on the box takes a

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,180
vector graphics file and jams it into

72
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,579
Eagle and it brings it in as an actual

73
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,159
polygon object so where do you get an

74
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,599
SVG well vector graphics drawing

75
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,480
programs are abundant I'm talking Adobe

76
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,549
Illustrator I'm talking Inkscape free

77
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:12,790
and open source under the GPL CorelDraw

78
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,900
I guess you can also get a vector

79
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,370
graphics out of the most popular CAD

80
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,730
programs so you can export like a DXF

81
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,340
out of your favorite cad suite and then

82
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,810
bring it into something like Inkscape

83
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,810
and export it as an SVG and get that

84
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,239
onto your board basically you take your

85
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:32,949
thing in the drawing program you bring

86
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,480
it in SVG deagle it's a little web

87
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,489
interface you can run it right on github

88
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:38,139
do or you can download it and run

89
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,449
locally if you're into that and it

90
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:42,010
exports an equal script you run the

91
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,419
script an eagle and you get your shape

92
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:46,510
on your board any layer that you want so

93
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,430
if you're going to use this tool I

94
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,730
highly recommend this video this is you

95
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,590
can find this on YouTube it's 20 minutes

96
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,449
long it's gonna take you end to end

97
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:57,549
through the process of using that tool

98
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:02,650
to get graphics into Eagle and yeah

99
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,389
there are a few gotchas so best

100
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,000
practices all in this video

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,519
big shout out at tall dark and weird oh

102
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,699
and Twitter smash that like button

103
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:16,839
subscribe advantages and disadvantages

104
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,418
right so advantages small file sizes are

105
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,430
always good right vector graphics are

106
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,479
pretty small compared to something like

107
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,820
a bitmap accurate dimensions if you draw

108
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,440
something five millimeters in an SVG

109
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,510
it's gonna be five millimeters when you

110
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,240
bring it into Eagle so for mechanical

111
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,510
design this is very important also

112
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,099
creating filled polygons and pores so

113
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:37,870
especially in your copper layer where

114
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,210
eagle is gonna treat any polygon like a

115
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,360
like a poor like a ground poor you want

116
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,550
eagle to recognize it as a polygon and

117
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,490
not just as like a big bitmap of a bunch

118
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,900
of straight lines or something because

119
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,029
then it will respect your design rules

120
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:53,830
with respect to things like thermals and

121
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,400
isolations disadvantages it has to be a

122
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,750
vector drawing so if you're just like

123
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,729
scanning the internet looking for like

124
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,860
some clipart you can steal and put on a

125
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,950
board you're gonna be limited to two you

126
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,240
know you're gonna have to find something

127
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,340
that's an SVG there's a little bit of

128
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,690
fiddling that's required to get things

129
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,870
to work nicely in SVG to Eagle and then

130
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,400
finally moving imported items is a

131
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,200
little bit of a pain so because they do

132
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,150
come in as actual polygons if you like

133
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,250
drag select them and you don't get all

134
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,840
of the points you end up like stretching

135
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,979
your thing and moving it all over the

136
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,110
place and if you've ever tried to select

137
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,909
something on a particular layer in Eagle

138
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:29,620
you know it's a little bit painful

139
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,469
sometimes the one way around this is

140
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:34,900
that you can just run this script and

141
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,820
then copy your polygon into the

142
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,560
footprint editor into the library editor

143
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,060
and make a footprint out of it and then

144
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,860
you can just sort of like click and drag

145
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,520
it the second way you might do this is

146
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,659
to use something called Buzzard

147
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:50,219
I wrote Buzzard for smart fun and it is

148
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:54,010
open source MIT license and it is

149
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,349
designed for PCB painting so it does

150
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:59,110
really well with bitmaps or basically

151
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,139
any image format and this is kind of

152
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:03,520
what the workflow looks like so this is

153
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,539
my selfie PCB a selfie in the top corner

154
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:09,849
there you bring that in to you just open

155
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,949
it in the little web interface again

156
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:14,740
it's on github IO so you can just run in

157
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,500
your browser and then you can select a

158
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,900
different black and white threshold for

159
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,349
each layer on your PCB so it lets you

160
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,110
preview the copper layer the solder mask

161
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,659
and the silkscreen all together and then

162
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,750
you can export that as an eagle library

163
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,060
file and that library has a single

164
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,660
component

165
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,040
that's a footprint that combines all

166
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,660
those layers together so it makes it

167
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,310
really easy to deal with because like a

168
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,810
lot of the time you add art at the end

169
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,610
of a PCB project because it gets in the

170
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,710
way of everything else with this it's a

171
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,970
little bit easier to deal with because

172
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,370
you have like one origin on that

173
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,870
footprint right where you're not gonna

174
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,190
accidentally select it when you're

175
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,480
moving stuff around advantages of this

176
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,820
basically any image format so it's all

177
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,940
built on JavaScript so anything that you

178
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,280
can pull into a canvas object in html5

179
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,850
so any like web friendly image format

180
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,820
it'll open and turn into a rasterized

181
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,580
image it lets you preview and generate

182
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,870
all three of those layers at the same

183
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,070
time so you can kind of get a feel for

184
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,540
what's gonna look like before you pull

185
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,370
it into evil and then finally it exports

186
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,200
it like I said as a library footprint so

187
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,210
it's all like one thing all mashed

188
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,810
together

189
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,110
I'm disadvantages big file sizes so like

190
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,420
big file sizes in Eagle right is like a

191
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,360
few megabytes so no big deal except when

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,470
you go to actually generate your

193
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,910
Gerber's so you're gonna need those

194
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,830
Gerber's for the fab house to make your

195
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,410
boards and i have found that if you have

196
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,110
a bunch of these rasterized images which

197
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,760
are just made up of I mean my thing is

198
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,040
just exporting like a thousands

199
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,890
horizontal lines is what it's doing and

200
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,250
they're all grouped together but when

201
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,020
the cam processor goes to actually make

202
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,550
those into Gerber's it it a cam job that

203
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,980
might normally take like 30 seconds can

204
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,470
take upwards of five minutes but you're

205
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,150
doing that once over the life of a board

206
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,150
hopefully so you know it's not the end

207
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,580
of the world finally fixed import

208
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,730
resolutions so no matter what the size

209
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,669
of your source file or your output is

210
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:17,980
it's gonna scan a fixed number of lines

211
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,930
out of that file so if your source is

212
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,330
very small or your outputs very large it

213
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,000
can get kind of steppy and I'm working

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,890
on that right now kind of smooth that

215
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,890
out and do a either a dynamic resolution

216
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,380
thing or maybe just make a high-res

217
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,849
version of Buzzard that people can use

218
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:36,280
and what we're talking about Buzzard I

219
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,349
just want to plug the label maker so it

220
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,270
also has a label maker that I built that

221
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,190
we use for all of our pins on our boards

222
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,169
at Sparkfun and you just put in like

223
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,010
comma separated text

224
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,040
and it makes this little like field of

225
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,449
bubbles that you can click on and edit

226
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:52,279
independently and you can change the

227
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,889
font and the size and the shape and then

228
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:56,750
export it as a library that has all of

229
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,209
those footprints in it so you can put

230
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:00,800
them on your board it's really handy for

231
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,050
labeling pin headers and stuff like that

232
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,519
LEDs and you put Unicode characters in

233
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,699
it so like a little little like Skull

234
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:13,790
and Bones or a little like anything you

235
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,820
want like emojis like it's it's pretty

236
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,490
sweet so alright and the third method is

237
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,649
not really a method at all it's not a

238
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:24,290
trick it's just draw it draw it just

239
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,050
draw it and it turns out like there are

240
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,310
some things that are really easy to draw

241
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,560
like space invaders it's all 90-degree

242
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,649
angles and Eagle love's 90-degree angles

243
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:35,449
on a grid are you kidding it can't

244
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:39,110
believe its luck so that's so that's I

245
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,160
mean that's just that right

246
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,350
advantages/disadvantages it works in any

247
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,560
like if you can make a footprint you can

248
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,649
make a space invader no external tools

249
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:50,680
required great for pixel art

250
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,089
disadvantages EDA tools are not drawing

251
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:55,160
tools I think that's probably gonna

252
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,750
change a little bit in the coming years

253
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,639
with badge life being such a big thing

254
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,709
like fingers crossed we might get like

255
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:03,920
Bezier curves in an EDA which sounds

256
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,610
wild but I think we could do it if we

257
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,420
work together okay also you have to draw

258
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,839
a thing which isn't my strong suit so

259
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,690
it's not the best method maybe for some

260
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,480
people but anyway so anyway we've got

261
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,410
weird shapes good now what well you put

262
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,519
those weird shapes into different layers

263
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,529
in your PCB and now you can kind of

264
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,089
stack the PCBs together fit them

265
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:30,769
together and make things in three

266
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:32,779
dimensions now the easiest way to do

267
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,850
this is with sort of like joinery like

268
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,839
if you imagine you're doing like a

269
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,459
woodworking project except you're using

270
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:40,880
fiberglass and the way that I like to do

271
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,889
this a lot is with this sort of like tab

272
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,199
and slot construction right like sort of

273
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:47,839
like a cross lap joint if you're into

274
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,980
woodworking which looks like this so

275
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,860
this is a little PCB that I made you

276
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,420
snap all these pieces apart you put them

277
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,580
together throw

278
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,350
we'll fill its otters on there and

279
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,550
you've got like a little robot guy and

280
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,840
it's it's like a fun little kit it takes

281
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,820
like five minutes to put together

282
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,710
I sold a handful of these at Maker Faire

283
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,490
San Mateo like kids love these things

284
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,350
and I love them too I keep them on my

285
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,890
desk so the in theory this is like a

286
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,330
really simple thing to do right you just

287
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,370
make a slot that's the same width as the

288
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,290
thickness of your PCB and then sort of

289
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,090
like half the depth that you want the

290
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,420
two parts to join and Mechanical

291
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,800
Engineers will know this but electrical

292
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,630
engineers often don't know this it

293
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,250
doesn't work that way because it turns

294
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,800
out if you specify those two slots to be

295
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,500
exactly the size you want they're just

296
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,670
making these things with an end mill

297
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,380
right like an end mill has to go in

298
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,500
there and make that cut and they like

299
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,420
exist in the world and have dimensions

300
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,240
so if they're like bringing that round

301
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,010
in mill into a corner it doesn't

302
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,420
actually get into the corner and you end

303
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,130
up with something like this where you

304
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,290
like this is beautiful this is what I

305
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,760
designed and this is supposed to work

306
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,920
and then know you got this round corner

307
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,240
and now this isn't gonna fit all the way

308
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,970
in there so the way you fix that as you

309
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,270
put Mickey Mouse ears on it and this

310
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,800
works really well and you can draw those

311
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,270
Mickey Mouse ears in the dimension layer

312
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,760
if you feel like it but I've found

313
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,520
actually what works best is just throw

314
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,360
some drill hits on there so make your

315
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,040
slots exactly the size you want them to

316
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,220
be and then throw you know like 20 or 40

317
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,740
mil drill hits on there and they'll do

318
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,120
the drill hits before they do the mill

319
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,530
and you end up with that nice corner

320
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,540
relief that lets everything slot

321
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,940
together the way that it's supposed to

322
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,990
so once you've got things fitting

323
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,790
together how do you actually fasten them

324
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,440
well solder works really well for this

325
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,890
so there's one thing that you're gonna

326
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,720
run into though with with soldering

327
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,780
and-and-and it's lifting pads so a fill

328
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,910
it fill it soldering is a lot like

329
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,590
Phillip welding so what's a Phillip well

330
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,120
it's not fillet it looks like fillet

331
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,370
it's not fillet it's full it it just

332
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,620
means a rounded corner and when you fill

333
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,790
it solder something together you're

334
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,530
basically taking two surfaces at an

335
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,510
angle and you're filling in that corner

336
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,590
with solder to connect them and when you

337
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,440
go to design a joint like this there are

338
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,570
a couple ways you can do it and this on

339
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,440
the left is kind of

340
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,850
like what your first approach might be

341
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,400
just a little island of copper on bare

342
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,350
PCB you put them next to each other and

343
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,850
you solder and write like that works

344
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,530
great except two things one the strength

345
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,970
of the solder joint is not your limiting

346
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,410
factor here it's actually the strength

347
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,140
of the glue that's holding the copper to

348
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,240
the PCB because you're gonna rip that

349
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,190
pad up and second of all you're gonna

350
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,890
get it like way wicked hot when you pour

351
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,180
all that solder on there to make that

352
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,860
joint and it's gonna delaminate from the

353
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,250
board so how might you fix that well you

354
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,110
could make the copper layer much larger

355
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,820
and then just cover everything that you

356
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,160
don't want to solder with solder mask

357
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,710
and that works great except that now you

358
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,180
have this huge heatsink that makes it

359
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,460
very hard to solder and also maybe I

360
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,890
don't want solder mask there like yeah

361
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,300
that's what solder mask is literally

362
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,610
made for but maybe I want to use it to

363
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,200
draw like a cool shape on the board and

364
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,220
I don't want to have all the solder mask

365
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,210
all over the place so it turns out what

366
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,340
you can do is you can go back to the

367
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,130
like simple method and you can just sort

368
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,230
of do this galaxy brain method over here

369
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,720
where you drop a via in the middle of

370
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,760
the pad and then that via basically acts

371
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,010
like a rivet that holds like goes

372
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,390
through the board and holds it on the

373
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,460
other side and so now you're not gonna

374
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,070
lift the pad when you heat it up and

375
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,330
it's actually kind of acting like a

376
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,720
mechanical fastener and it doesn't take

377
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,290
very much real estate all right so

378
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,610
you've got all these little tiny bits

379
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,500
and pieces you know one project might

380
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,730
have like 40 different little shapes

381
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,920
that you have to connect together

382
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,510
you can hand somebody a bag of like 40

383
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,060
different little PCBs if you want to

384
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,260
they're not always psyched about it so

385
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,630
what you might do is give them all on a

386
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,420
nice little frame right like like this

387
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,240
like plastic model-making kits right so

388
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,060
if you do like Gunpla or like any kind

389
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,680
of plastic model building you might be

390
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,140
familiar with sprues sprues are what

391
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,960
happens when you injection mold things

392
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,460
it's all the channels that the plastic

393
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,720
had to get through to get to your parts

394
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,250
and then you just take that whole thing

395
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,540
and hand it to somebody and they can

396
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,430
snap out the parts on their own and give

397
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,990
them a little bit of sand good together

398
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,680
so we are not injection molding anything

399
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,830
but we can pretend right so this is what

400
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,290
I did with my robot I just

401
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,269
drew a panel with little sprues on there

402
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:26,560
that connect all of the things together

403
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,680
and then when you want to separate them

404
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,940
everywhere that there's a separation you

405
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,370
just put Mouse bites and mouse bites are

406
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,050
little tiny holes all drilled right next

407
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,000
to each other

408
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,769
these are what I usually use they're 20

409
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:41,410
mil diameter holes spaced 40 mils apart

410
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,170
they snap really easily by hand at sort

411
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,910
of that half what we generally call like

412
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,319
a half thickness PCB point eight

413
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:50,230
millimeter they do snap by hand at one

414
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,600
point six millimeter as well but it

415
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,430
helps to have pliers if you want a nice

416
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,829
clean break and you can sand down the

417
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:59,170
edges that are left over and the thing

418
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,089
that you might think is like well is the

419
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:02,470
board house gonna care that I have like

420
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,209
a whole bunch of holes drilled in this

421
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:05,769
thing really close together and I was

422
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:12,399
like they might so I did this it's not

423
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,079
what it looks like so this whole thing

424
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,079
is actually it was a lot of work for a

425
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,139
really dumb pun it's a it's it's sheets

426
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:25,329
of not LSD but LEDs so what I did is I

427
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,649
each of these little squares has a

428
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:28,420
little oh six a three pad on the back

429
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,639
for a resistor and an LED and then on

430
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,310
the front I replicated the infamous

431
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,490
orange sunshine artwork and then drilled

432
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,529
I think it's like a thousand and ninety

433
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,949
six holes in each board board house

434
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:43,449
didn't care at all they didn't bat an

435
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:45,519
eye right like apparently there are tons

436
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,959
of designs out there that have just a

437
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,870
ton of vias especially if you use the

438
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,720
auto router and they don't so they're

439
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,389
used to it they don't care so this is

440
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,370
the mouse bites is a great way to do

441
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,440
that okay so we've done weird shapes in

442
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,290
the let's see we've done weird shapes in

443
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,720
the dimension layer we've done weird

444
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,369
shapes in the copper layer let's play

445
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:11,349
with the mask layer okay so PCBs are

446
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,569
made out of fiberglass and most of them

447
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,909
unless you order those really sexy after

448
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,659
dark PCBs from OSH Park is clear

449
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:21,909
fiberglass and so it works really well

450
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:24,209
as an LED diffuser and so if you just

451
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,400
draw your your favorite shapes in the T

452
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,809
stop and B stop layers

453
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:30,790
that's the Eagle nomenclature for the

454
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,570
masks top layers you can shine an LED

455
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,309
through it and you get nice segmented

456
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:37,390
displays

457
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,799
you have to make sure you know there's

458
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,830
no copper under there and then I found

459
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,320
that it also helps to have a sandwich in

460
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,030
between where you're just literally

461
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,429
milling out a little well for the LED to

462
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:49,990
sit in to stop light from leaking

463
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,309
between your segments so that's a seven

464
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:56,380
segment display that I made out of PCBs

465
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,690
it's just Oh 603 LEDs on the bottom with

466
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,549
some resistors and then it's the stack

467
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:02,500
PCBs right on top of each other and

468
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,690
that's cool but like I can buy a seven

469
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,340
segment display and it's cheaper than

470
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,440
doing this but you can make anything you

471
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,100
want so this is my space invaders badge

472
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,340
this is three layers of PCB with space

473
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,470
invaders and little bullets all on the

474
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,140
top layer and underneath are just

475
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,910
addressable LEDs I'm using the APA one a

476
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,799
two twenty twenty little tiny

477
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,220
addressable LEDs and what's running this

478
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,350
is just a it's just an 18 mega 32 you

479
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,390
for it doesn't take a lot of processing

480
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,860
power if you have the addressable as

481
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,730
writes because you're not like

482
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,980
maintaining a matrix of LEDs and having

483
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,740
to keep them on long enough to see them

484
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,929
so this is a cool thing you can do turns

485
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:45,850
out actually back in the day when

486
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,070
nintendo was prototyping The Game and

487
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,480
Watch games if you guys remember game

488
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,890
and watch they were like this little LCD

489
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,880
like fixed segment display games kind of

490
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,669
like the tiger electronic games when

491
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,630
they were prototyping those they

492
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,520
actually cut all of the segments out of

493
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,410
like smoked acrylic and backlit them

494
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,470
with like little grain of wheat bulbs

495
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,540
little incandescent bulbs because it was

496
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,910
cheaper to do that than it was to like

497
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,429
have a prototype LCD made every time

498
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:14,530
that they wanted to test the gameplay so

499
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,240
there were all these like models like

500
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,070
desktop size models of all the Game &

501
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,720
Watch games and so like if you think

502
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,520
about it you could do any of your

503
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,809
favorite game and watch games in the

504
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:27,250
style another thing that I did on that

505
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,620
project was bendy tap buttons so this is

506
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,320
like my new favorite thing if you cut

507
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,110
like a long finger into a piece of

508
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,299
fiberglass it has a little bit of flex

509
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,890
to it especially if you're doing like a

510
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,840
half thickness PCB like point eight

511
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,530
millimeter and then you can bend it down

512
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,750
into like a button so this is a little

513
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,990
no clone that I made that has the reset

514
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,680
button as a little finger in the top

515
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,960
sandwich of this PCB and then underneath

516
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,030
that I actually just soldered like an

517
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,610
existing push-button module this is nice

518
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,960
because you don't need a lot of travel

519
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,400
so you don't need to really push down on

520
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,260
that fibreglass too hard and really flex

521
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,730
it you're just pushing down hard enough

522
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,320
to hit that button and you get the nice

523
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,480
tactile feedback that's built into that

524
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,120
button module but if you want to be

525
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,660
really cheap you could just do this this

526
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,910
is what I did on the Space Invaders

527
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:27,450
sorry the cosmic aggressors badge and so

528
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,610
what I've done is on that top layer it's

529
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,350
all just a ground plane and it's

530
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,730
connected to the ground on the bottom

531
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,380
layer through the headers that I'm using

532
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,580
as rivets to hold the whole thing

533
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,250
together and then I just put a little

534
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,080
bit of solder blob on the bottom and

535
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,450
when you flex those they touch and then

536
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,060
I'm just using the internal pull ups on

537
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,580
the processor and I know when the pin

538
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,350
goes low that you've pressed the button

539
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:54,000
luckily in space in cosmic aggressor you

540
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,070
don't actually move that fast so I'm

541
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,690
pulling that button once every like I

542
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,180
don't know tens of milliseconds so I'm

543
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,800
not doing any fancy deep bouncing or

544
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,870
anything right this is a really noisy

545
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,550
switch like if you hook this up to a

546
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,410
scope and like pushed it like you're

547
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,600
like grinding solder into itself so it's

548
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,010
like noise doesn't matter for this so

549
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,510
okay so you can make contacts for

550
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,860
switches can you make contacts for

551
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,260
wipers sure why not

552
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,320
so this is a rotary encoder made out of

553
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,380
PCBs there's three layers the bottom

554
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,590
layer has a little surface mount pogo

555
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,070
pins and they contact the encoder track

556
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,830
on the middle PCB and then the top one

557
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,630
just retains it mechanically through

558
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,210
those standoffs and as while I was at it

559
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,740
I threw some addressable LEDs on the

560
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,930
underside of it and then I addressed

561
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,240
those through the metal in the standoffs

562
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,340
and yeah you can hook this up to Arduino

563
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,050
run the encoder library and worse works

564
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,890
like a charm actually

565
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,990
it's a little difficult like if you've

566
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,760
never designed a rotary encoder it turns

567
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,420
out like drawing segments of circles to

568
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,940
be like the right distance apart is kind

569
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,470
of a pain in the ass I think I did like

570
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,000
four revs of this before I got one that

571
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,220
worked and what you're gonna do is

572
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,720
you're gonna be like oh I'm super clever

573
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,130
I figured I had to do this with only

574
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,900
like two contacts or three and you're

575
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,450
not using you're gonna rediscover why

576
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,780
they're built the way they are so so

577
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,580
yeah this this is totally a possibility

578
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,680
is it economical not on its own probably

579
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,360
like you're not gonna do this instead of

580
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,510
go buy a rotary encoder but you might do

581
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,160
this if you want to make a fancy badge

582
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,210
or if you have like a larger like PCB

583
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,950
monstrosity that you want to build an

584
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,360
encoder into you'd totally do this so

585
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,340
stacking boards all of this has to do

586
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,500
with stacking boards so aside from the

587
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,000
kits that I talked about at the

588
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,110
beginning where you're kind of putting

589
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,140
boards at perpendicular to each other

590
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,100
everything else that I'm doing is just

591
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,930
stacking boards directly on top of each

592
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,790
other and not only does this allow you

593
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,460
to get like nice topographic curves out

594
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,990
of things kind of the same way you would

595
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,000
if you were like stacking laser-cut

596
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,570
acrylic

597
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,570
if you you know you're thinking kind of

598
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,040
in the same way when you're doing that

599
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,380
kind of design but it also allows you to

600
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,820
have like cavities and channels in

601
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,690
between the boards

602
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,980
so on the Space Invader cosmic aggressor

603
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,670
board you have three layers and three

604
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,900
layers are actually doing two different

605
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,150
things in different sections of the

606
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,430
board on the top section with the LEDs

607
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,560
this is the stack up right so these are

608
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,900
the footprints for the APA 102's these

609
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,790
are little drill hits that act as light

610
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,070
wells to hold the LEDs and keep them

611
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,800
from shining on each other and then the

612
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,240
top layer is just the nice little like

613
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,130
mask and that's cool and then you can

614
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,110
take out that Center layer later in the

615
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:50,550
board right and it makes this nice like

616
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,590
section this chasm where you have room

617
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,600
to bend these two sections together and

618
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,320
that's how you make your switches so you

619
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,790
know if you if you go through and sort

620
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,560
of like layout where you want these

621
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,210
different features to be you can get a

622
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,620
lot of functionality out of just these

623
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,420
this handful of boards stacked on top of

624
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,390
each other

625
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,220
so it's pretty much all I have time to

626
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,670
talk about I think but I want to like

627
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,710
spare a thought for the the poor

628
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,620
engineer who's on the business end of

629
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,679
your Gerber's because they're gonna have

630
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,690
to figure out what the hell you were

631
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,490
thinking when you decide to put like a

632
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,440
thousand holes in something or like put

633
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,030
a bunch of V scores on one end of a

634
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,340
board or like whatever it is you're

635
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,059
doing and so these are some lessons I've

636
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:37,549
learned through like really long email

637
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:39,860
exchanges over the time difference

638
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,960
between here and the fab house in China

639
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,260
and one thing is like just check up on

640
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,970
what they can do before you ask them to

641
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,740
do something and just assume they can do

642
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,020
it look at things like their drill sizes

643
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,669
a lot of the time you can specify any

644
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:53,870
drill size that you want and they'll

645
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,210
just pick whatever is closest out of

646
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,600
their catalogue so if you need something

647
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,100
various with a tight mechanical

648
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,080
tolerance check and see what drill sizes

649
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,410
they actually have and specify those

650
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,640
look at things like the minimum spacing

651
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,490
so like the minimum sort of distance

652
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,900
that things can be from each other

653
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,460
before they start to bleed together and

654
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,500
that's for basically any layer right

655
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,840
like the copper layer the silkscreen the

656
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,400
mask they're all gonna have different

657
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,600
they're all put on with different

658
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,220
processes so they're all gonna have sort

659
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,250
of different tolerances minimum slot

660
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:25,730
width

661
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,419
I'll you know again the end mill is has

662
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:30,830
dimension in three dimensions right like

663
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,840
it is a size so you can't make an

664
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,540
infinitely thin slot in a PCB it's gonna

665
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,960
be a minimum thickness label your V

666
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,760
score lines oh yeah

667
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,410
leave notes and leave them in a layer

668
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,799
that the engineer will see because you

669
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,780
can put a ton of notes like super nice

670
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,760
notes in your like some random layer in

671
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,919
Eagle right and then you export it to

672
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:56,200
Gerber's and those notes are just

673
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,760
they're just in Eagle now and you send

674
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,200
the Gerber's to the production engineer

675
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,150
and he doesn't get any clue as to what

676
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,220
you're trying to do so I found that

677
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,660
leaving notes in the copper layer works

678
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,309
great like outside the dimension of your

679
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:08,570
badge obviously because they'll just

680
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,919
throw them in there

681
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,710
but yeah in the copper layer I'll put

682
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,390
things like this is a V score line I

683
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,490
need this routed out you know stuff like

684
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,390
that

685
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,240
oh yeah and if two pours don't connect

686
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,530
so there's a lot of situations where

687
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,320
you'll just have a copper like a like a

688
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,120
ground plane and then you're gonna put

689
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,060
mouse bites in there and what the

690
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,680
production engineer will see is these

691
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,320
two pours that we're supposed to be

692
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,160
connected and look like they're going to

693
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,230
be connected but they know because they

694
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,760
are a production engineer that when you

695
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,620
drill all those holes that as the drill

696
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,240
goes through it tears the copper layer

697
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,950
and you don't actually get an electrical

698
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,570
connection there and they're gonna warn

699
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,830
you about that because they don't want

700
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,320
you to ask for a refund so then you have

701
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,870
to email and explain to them it would be

702
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,310
cool if it works but if it doesn't work

703
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,960
it's not a big deal like that's not

704
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,550
something they hear very often it's like

705
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,080
I just want to see if it works and if it

706
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,190
doesn't work I'm not gonna return the

707
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,890
boards or anything so you have to like

708
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,930
convince them like no I fine do whatever

709
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,140
you want we'll see it's an experiment so

710
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,810
a lot of the time now I'll just like put

711
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,270
a little keep out around things like

712
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,950
that so that it's very obvious that I

713
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,210
don't intend for those things to connect

714
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,010
yeah I think that's everything I've got

715
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,260
finally the here's a QR code you can

716
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,650
take a picture of if you're into that it

717
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,070
points to this URL I promise this is the

718
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,070
this is the github repository where I've

719
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,520
put up all of these slides and at some

720
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,200
point this weekend I'm also going to add

721
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,930
an eagle library that's full of like

722
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,180
little design features that you can add

723
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,810
to your boards and also examples links

724
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,850
to like all the resources I talked about

725
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,800
and examples of all of these things in

726
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,660
different projects that I've done so

727
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,610
keep an eye on that repo it'll get

728
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,430
updated over the next few days hopefully

729
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:05,880
I'm gonna try so does this help I'm just

730
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,290
gonna yeah there you go yes that's

731
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,540
everything I've got I got I think like

732
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,160
three minutes or something so if anybody

733
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,360
has questions I can probably take like a

734
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,570
few questions two or three questions yes

735
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:32,669
how do you keep out yeah yep mm-hmm so

736
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:36,700
so if you a lot of what you're gonna be

737
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,960
doing the the question was like how do

738
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,610
you handle the like I keep out for the

739
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,590
copper on the edge of the board when

740
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,730
you're doing like those bendy tab

741
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,179
buttons and like board houses generally

742
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:47,500
don't care how close to the edge you get

743
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,289
with the copper pour but so what you're

744
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:51,580
gonna end up doing a lot when you're

745
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,620
doing this kind of thing is going in and

746
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,850
finding a balance between like

747
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,610
explicitly telling your design tool that

748
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,289
this is a keep out like using something

749
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:01,299
like to keep out layer in Eagle and then

750
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:04,120
also adjusting your general design rules

751
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,200
to like make your spacings very small so

752
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,789
generally I'll go into my design rules

753
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,980
and I'll just turn off like isolate and

754
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,830
make it zero mil so that everything just

755
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,269
runs up straight up against each other

756
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:18,190
and then I'll go in and explicitly like

757
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:23,490
mark where I want keep outs to be yes

758
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,420
yeah yeah yeah for sure I definitely

759
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,260
want to do that I dug into the Chi CAD

760
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,800
style like the library files a while

761
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,120
back for a different project I was like

762
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,560
oh this is really isn't that different

763
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,350
so compatibility wise it shouldn't be

764
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,030
like a heavy lift but I just don't have

765
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,460
a ton of time so I'm gonna work on it

766
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,350
but if anyone else wants to work on it

767
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,960
you're welcome to of course and send me

768
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,560
a pull request but yes I do a plan to

769
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,200
eventually have add functionality

770
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,270
there because I do use Chi CAD on

771
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,560
occasion especially if I want to make a

772
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,100
very large PCB Autodesk in their

773
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,620
infinite wisdom has put a size limit on

774
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,930
how big of a PCB you can make an Eagle

775
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:15,020
standard any other questions yes so

776
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,550
there are a couple ways you can go about

777
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,990
attaching multiple layers when they're

778
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,370
stacked directly against each other you

779
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,820
can either use SMD pads and then Castle

780
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,180
ated connectors so Castle ation if

781
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,530
you're not familiar with that is

782
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,030
basically you make a plated through hole

783
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,560
and then you mill half of it away

784
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,510
and you end up with like a plated edge

785
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,000
and the cool thing about Castle ations

786
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,590
is they don't cost extra the way that

787
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,630
edge plating does so a lot of board

788
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,070
houses will have a thing where it's like

789
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,200
oh you can get edge plating and so you

790
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,820
just specify like where along the edge

791
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,200
of the board you want the copper to go

792
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,490
and it costs a lot more but if you just

793
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,490
put a like a really big diameter like

794
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,320
plated through-hole and then tell them

795
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,540
the mil most of it away you end up with

796
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,370
like a little concavity that's plated

797
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,280
over the edge so that's one way you can

798
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,900
do it you have that on the top layer and

799
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,950
then on the bottom layer you have a

800
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,990
landing pad for it and you just sort of

801
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,000
put solder in there another way to do it

802
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,620
is to just put drill hits all the way

803
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,600
through all of your boards and this is

804
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,170
what I did for the space invaders badge

805
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,830
cosmic aggressor badge let's do it every

806
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,250
time I just have plated through holes on

807
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,130
every layer and then I put a I just take

808
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,990
up a single pin header and I put it

809
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,580
through and solder it on one end and

810
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,800
then smoosh all the boards together and

811
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,150
solder it on the other end and clip it

812
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,400
off like a little rivet and

813
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,200
just sandwiches everything together and

814
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,940
the nice thing about that is it's really

815
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,650
simple to just take a soldering iron and

816
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,090
touch it real quick and peel that top

817
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,559
board back off and take everything apart

818
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,360
for repair I think I nake one more

819
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,540
question

820
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,070
not super nicely like so ideally

821
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,270
actually what you want is you don't

822
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,740
really want the solder to flow all the

823
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,210
way down the rivet because then like

824
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,130
what you would really want us to tack it

825
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,380
on both sides and then the middle layers

826
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,970
are floating so that when you take if

827
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,550
you need to take it apart for whatever

828
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,350
reason like you spilled a diet coke on

829
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,340
it just hypothetically then then it's

830
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,530
easy to just wick away that solder from

831
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,820
the top and take all that your layers

832
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,590
apart if you want this order to wick

833
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,600
down in there like you can just flux the

834
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,990
heck out of it and that will work all

835
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,429
right thank you I think that's all the

836
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:27,230
time I got

837
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:31,960
[Applause]
