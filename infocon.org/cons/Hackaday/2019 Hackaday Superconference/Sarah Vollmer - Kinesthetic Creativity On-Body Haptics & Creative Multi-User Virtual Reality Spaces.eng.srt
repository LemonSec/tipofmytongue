1
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,570
okay so our next speaker is a software

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,429
engineer who fuses her work with

3
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,650
painting coding and VR to create

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,920
artistic escapes that envision the

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,020
future of how we could how the world

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,910
could be her talk today is going to be

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,550
focusing on a novel application for

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,519
on-body haptics so please welcome to the

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,260
hackaday a super conference stage sarah

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:42,059
Bulmer okay so one little correction not

11
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,940
a software engineer just learned how to

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,030
do that so what I'm here to talk about

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,809
is sort start off with an adventure in

14
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:53,309
sensory perception and how to sort of

15
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,110
combine different senses and sort of

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,660
authoritative I guess performances that

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,910
we do and so we're looking at connecting

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,949
haptics maybe to light sound body

19
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,559
sensing all types of these these ways of

20
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,810
kind of communicating different sort of

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,810
experiences in a performative context so

22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,700
what I mean by that is let's say we've

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,110
got maybe four or five of us that want

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,890
to put on a show

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,750
and we would do it in terms of having

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,820
body sensing or biosensing maybe on our

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,170
hearts and we'd have that connected to

28
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,700
someone else and they would be able to

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,259
feel what the other person's feeling or

30
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,119
maybe the lights or something dictating

31
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,189
what's happening on your body if the

32
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,049
body just you're tracking that sort of

33
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,990
thing as well and so because of this

34
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,240
then way they're doing performances we

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,619
got to really switch the gear around

36
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,659
pretty easily so I really give it to you

37
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,310
you give it to them and if there's a

38
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,229
flow of people coming through so what

39
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,150
happens as we kind of we wanted to wear

40
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,350
wearables I need to put some kind of

41
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,290
haptics into the systems but because of

42
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,420
that they tend to be like the specific

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,549
to one person and then we can transfer

44
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,409
them easily so I was thinking about what

45
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,899
I could do and one of the things I was

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,520
looking at was maybe we can have some

47
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,350
kind of modular you know pieces I could

48
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,380
transfer around and so the first thing I

49
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,140
came up with which was a great fun as I

50
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,159
thought that maybe I could connect

51
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,229
things with a lilypad arduino because

52
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,330
then we could wear them on ourselves but

53
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,669
that involved a lot of so

54
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,530
and I wasn't good so that was not there

55
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,060
but then I end up with five with his

56
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,130
left over so at five of those I need to

57
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,270
connect into something so I connected

58
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,580
them with a Bluetooth obviously HCF iho

59
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,700
6s okay so we got modules there and that

60
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,100
was cool but they they kind of fell

61
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,170
apart but they did work the one time and

62
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,030
so after that I'm thinking what else can

63
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,310
we do with these so I then started

64
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,220
looking into what else was there and I

65
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,150
realized first thing I want to do

66
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,440
obviously was come up with a new way to

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,950
connect things so how about it so we'll

68
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,430
talk about later

69
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,070
those are circuit boards PCBs we got

70
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,489
them set and so this here is what have

71
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,430
now got called the octopus here and if

72
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,500
we got eight different haptic centers on

73
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,950
here and so what how it works is we've

74
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,560
got one main module here okay

75
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,950
connect it through to eight of these

76
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,540
other sensors know you could have eight

77
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,550
three two one it doesn't matter that's

78
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,140
kind of the point so what I can do then

79
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,390
is you can easily you can easily pull

80
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,070
them on and off switch them around and

81
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,030
give them to other people

82
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,459
and so the point of that was that we can

83
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,410
either wrap them in an arm wrap around a

84
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,660
leg rabbet on your back neck etc it's

85
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,590
sort of transfer these systems um this

86
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,530
guy so all of this actually is online so

87
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,049
you can grab that if you want to um I

88
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,430
don't know can I play the movie or

89
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,320
tonight is there a movie I can put on

90
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:54,250
now yeah where we can just gonna do that

91
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,739
cool okay so um so what I just there's I

92
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:03,040
put together a couple things here so

93
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,870
taking this now into live performance

94
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,900
fine but I work in saw a VR do you like

95
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,959
building a world building in VR maybe

96
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,540
like last happier just started there and

97
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,339
so I'm interested in sort of your

98
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,470
sensory perception within VR okay so

99
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,510
looking at what's real it was not real

100
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,240
virtual obviously versus reality virtual

101
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,000
reality

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,040
and how can you transfer that sort of

103
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,990
information when you're in these worlds

104
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,220
and whether or not you know it's done

105
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,740
through sight which is obvious in VR but

106
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,300
how can you transfer other senses right

107
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,610
so haptics smell sound to these types of

108
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,160
things and so I've taken some of these

109
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,710
systems put them into there there's a

110
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,630
giant module with gloves and haptic

111
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,370
feedback that way and all kinds of parts

112
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,740
your body going through this and we're

113
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,860
in a position now to sort of expand to a

114
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,280
new idea and that's sort of doing a like

115
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,270
a silicone I guess I guess printed

116
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,800
silicone sort of knobs from your fingers

117
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,590
but in that context I'm looking at well

118
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,300
let's see you know everything else is

119
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,310
sort of big and clunky and so I was

120
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,210
talking with an artist friend of mine

121
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,370
and we're looking at perhaps starting

122
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,130
with the concept of aesthetics first and

123
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,730
so looking at the things like rings and

124
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,530
bracelets and instead of you know

125
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,510
starting with these giant electronics on

126
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,790
you know making them work that way and

127
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,810
like well maybe there's a way I could

128
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,660
force them into these smaller sort of

129
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,930
pieces and so that is in the process

130
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,450
we're halfway there but I've got just a

131
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,550
quick little clip here of sort of seeing

132
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,770
some of this in action within the VR

133
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,530
spaces I guess I'm so just hit this guy

134
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,550
think hmm so this here is just showing

135
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,020
yes so this is just streaming we're

136
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,350
getting the connection going from the

137
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,060
other so this is our lab there on my

138
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,150
work University or student there and so

139
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,380
this is the bounce here that I was

140
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,290
talking about just now so I just go

141
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,930
backwards a bit here I'm as you can see

142
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,500
here what we're doing is just

143
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,200
transferring obviously content so I'm

144
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,430
gonna can't say that clearly but it's

145
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,720
just looking at YouTube others so we're

146
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,460
doing through open sound control which

147
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,500
is just the way of sending signals that

148
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,520
you can allocate to each one and here he

149
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,500
goes we check it cleared out feeling it

150
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,770
make sure it's working belts on cool and

151
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,590
so in VR though I need to find a way

152
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,990
obviously to activate the boats so here

153
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,250
whatever so I've set up and HTC vive in

154
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,110
the sense and what I've got is the HTC

155
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,180
vive sort of camera fries they trigger

156
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,800
you know by just by sight for that one

157
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,240
to see whether or not I've got the

158
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,830
haptics on and what it can generate from

159
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,740
that and so when they camera

160
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,990
gets near the HTC vive trackers so

161
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,220
that's what I considered the hands here

162
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,160
when you're in VR when you notice those

163
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,449
when it knows is that that it triggers

164
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:46,310
the haptic response and so that was just

165
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,690
you know one way to sort of go about

166
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,970
that also we're thinking of you know

167
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,490
putting it in place around your body so

168
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,169
maybe you're in a world and a creature

169
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,729
comes up or something happens to you and

170
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,169
you can sort of sense that within your

171
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:04,639
the space you're in and coming in cool

172
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,220
you still going all right this is it

173
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,810
yeah so I think this is no this is not

174
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,069
the VR when I'll be our worlds were in

175
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:15,139
some just gonna let that one run here no

176
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:18,199
others know you're not but so it's kind

177
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,639
of just an interesting space to be in

178
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,639
and so here our hands I've tracked out

179
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,620
so these are gestures strictly to

180
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,539
someone's hands so when they're in this

181
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:27,830
space their their whole hand is now

182
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,020
mapped out that's coming through and

183
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,940
I've now connected both there's haptic

184
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,099
gloves and then haptic components to

185
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,639
them also you can see the one-to-one

186
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,530
ratio and so within that space there you

187
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,750
can kind of play around grab things they

188
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,310
haptic sort of with sense different

189
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,409
parts of your body we've got it in the

190
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,180
sense that you can also have your

191
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,759
gestures sort of trigger haptics on

192
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,469
other people um so that's sort of a

193
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:52,940
component as well as looking at world

194
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,830
building but in a collaborative sort of

195
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,780
co-creative spaces and that way you've

196
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,080
got multiple people in there so we're

197
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,810
also creating with you one example we've

198
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,990
been working on in the lab as well is um

199
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,669
modular synthesizers but in VR and then

200
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:08,990
morph multiple people can be playing at

201
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,969
the same time and so looking at you know

202
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:12,199
obviously you're trying to grab for your

203
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,360
articulated gestures with that so what

204
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,860
can we do to improve that so obviously

205
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,740
using hands maybe haptic feedback etc

206
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,449
that's was playing here I was wrapped up

207
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:23,180
quickly then so this hand here is my own

208
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,130
but what this started off was was our

209
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,870
new idea that we're thinking of with the

210
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,880
Rings and stuff so we're like there's my

211
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,819
new prototype here's on my hand and

212
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:33,770
where we're at is looking at it this way

213
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,140
so that's the content of talking about

214
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,270
in terms of having like a bracelet first

215
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,429
around your rings and wrist here and

216
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,289
sensors and things on your fingers and

217
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,880
so the warned constraint though is

218
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,860
obviously to have it all in this very

219
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,839
small aesthetic sort of pleasing let's

220
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,040
say wait and see if you could it could

221
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,890
be done

222
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,500
so I'm in the process right now sort of

223
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,910
figuring out this printing out some

224
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,140
different materials

225
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,420
firstly I'm 3d printed like silicone and

226
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,830
that sort of thing and seeing if that

227
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,149
would fit it would be easy to transfer

228
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:02,250
between people I'm also looking at

229
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,110
within the pads themselves so just also

230
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,360
sensing things hunched that way also

231
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,190
tough pressure in them so maybe being

232
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,350
I'll to inject some kind of an air or

233
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,930
liquid maybe that works that way and

234
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,220
also having some kind of electrical

235
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,690
sense as well so beyond it kind of zap

236
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,300
things that part your around your body

237
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,070
and so we're going with that and that's

238
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,510
kind of where I'm going and that's about

239
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,710
what I've got today

240
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,999
