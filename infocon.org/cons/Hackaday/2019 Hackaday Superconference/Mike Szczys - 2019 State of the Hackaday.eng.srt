hello gun I've been really lucky to work

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:13,799
years

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,859
he's an orchestra musician in a symphony

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,890
by night he finds time somehow to work

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,240
on the production of the conference

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,100

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,160
years he is also the editor-in-chief of

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,769
hackaday let's welcome to the hackaday

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:37,290
super conference stage Mike's dish oh my

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:37,890

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,290
super Khan number five how is that

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,450
possible so first of all thank you for

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,579
being here I know Sunday morning is a

16
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,110
hard time to get out of bed because I

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,820
had to do it myself and I said oh my god

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,510
I got to give a long long talk today but

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,710
this is the most exciting time of year

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,899
because so many people that I love

21
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,399
seeing a love hanging around with and

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,859
and inspired by end up at the Super Con

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,030
and it's really special to be seeing

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,769
behind the scenes what happens we have a

25
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,530
wonderful staff of people there isn't

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,470
necessarily one central command but

27
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,760
there's a lot of people who know what

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,380
they're doing and when problems come up

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,030
they know how to solve them and have

30
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,820
made this every year even better than

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,710
the last I'm going to just give a round

32
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,420
of applause for everyone that has helped

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,100
organize and run super Khan this year I

34
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,890
[Applause]

35
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,579
have two identical-looking controllers I

36
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:37,170
think this is this one all right so I

37
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,210
have the pleasure of talking about

38
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,579
hackaday a lot and has anyone here ever

39
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,159
found themselves struggling to explain

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,340
to someone what a kadai is like it's a

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,930
weird thing right so I often go for

42
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,790
hackaday being a tech news website

43
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,070
because I'm really invested in the

44
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,180
writing that we do I'm editor-in-chief

45
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,880
of hackaday comm but it's so much more

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,560
than that and sometimes we talk about

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,229
hackaday being like a global virtual

48
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,360
hacker space so a place that you can go

49
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,098
and meet with a lot of other technical

50
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,020
people that are doing things that are

51
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,489
the same as what you're doing and doing

52
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,720
things that inspire you

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,970
helped you learn other things you could

54
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,930
look at as a project hosting website you

55
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,770
could look at it as a place that we go

56
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,990
and congregate around on different ideas

57
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,960
I really like to think of it as like

58
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,240
through the ask hackaday articles if you

59
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,100
need to know like collectively what do

60
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,480
we think about something like what are

61
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,800
the different ways to look at this that

62
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,300
I'm just not seeing what are the common

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,250
ways that people overcome it I think

64
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,750
that's a really interesting thing to tap

65
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,260
into oops oh I just gave away that I

66
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,680
give away the reveal slide so looking at

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,660
the ability of people to build really

68
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,640
high-end things I think can be really

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,380
inspiring and then going and seeing that

70
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,120
they're having the same problems that

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,590
you are and they were walking the same

72
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,030
path and that these things don't just

73
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,400
magic themselves into existence I think

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,410
it's you know the social media culture

75
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,240
it's really easy to look and see like

76
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,130
amazing project after amazing project

77
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,440
after amazing project and not see all of

78
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,540
the stuff that went in in behind that

79
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,480
and so I really like being within the

80
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,709
hackaday community and telling that

81
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,390
story like oh this thing totally didn't

82
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,340
work and I wasted all my time on it I

83
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,989
had to spin boards five times it was a

84
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,280
lot of money and the project came in

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,230
five months late and oh that totally

86
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,510
happens and so looking into this and

87
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,739
explaining about hackaday is I think

88
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,690
Elliott Williams has the best quote

89
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,370
which is that hackaday is the common

90
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,709
link in the collective brain so whenever

91
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:36,150
there's something that needs to be done

92
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,400
and you need to find a way to get over

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,950
this problem that you're having

94
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,799
oftentimes you're gonna find people are

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,030
have cross roads that go through

96
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,760
hackaday like you end up finding a new

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,140
part in you're like oh this new parts

98
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,790
awesome but I can't get it working and

99
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,989
you go and you google it and you're like

100
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,030
oh there's a heck of a article on it or

101
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,500
there's a heck of a project on it or

102
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,239
this person that I meant to the super

103
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,640
con wrote about it on their site or they

104
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,080
work for that company and I can actually

105
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,519
have the inside track to it

106
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,500
so I really look at hackaday when you

107
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,870
describe what it is it's a community

108
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,910
that already existed it's the community

109
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,100
that's right here and our role as

110
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,650
hackaday is to not screw that up to

111
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,600
facilitate that and to say let's

112
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,858
celebrate all these people and move them

113
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,440
forward and let's do it in a way that we

114
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,310
can all get behind and that welcomes

115
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,970
more people into it

116
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,530
I think we've done a lot of great things

117
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,970
this year and I wanted to go over a few

118
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,070
of them before I get into the bulk of

119
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,890
the talk possibly the thing I'm the most

120
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,990
excited about is we have a mobile view

121
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,970
that is totally awesome for reading

122
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,270
articles so where before we had the wide

123
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,800
view and you'd have to double tap over

124
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,720
here and it would it would get really

125
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,970
big now we have a responsive view I

126
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,920
spend the majority of my time reading on

127
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,050
the back end editing but whenever I'm

128
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,940
not there I'm on my phone as are like

129
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,340
more than 50% of our traffic and boy

130
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,470
having a mobile view now is is an

131
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,180
excellent excellent experience I'm very

132
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,310
happy about that but not just ahead get

133
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,920
a calm we have a mobile app for haka

134
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,840
data i/o as well and this is super cool

135
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,050
because I've actually stopped traveling

136
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,610
with the DSLR at this point because the

137
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,080
camera in my pocket is just so much

138
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,000
better and so I'm sure like all of you

139
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,650
when you're sitting at the bench and

140
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,910
working on something you're snapping

141
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,890
pictures constantly and then you have to

142
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,570
do this dance of like how do I get the

143
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,419
picture from my phone on to my project

144
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:24,820
and it's you know you could use a USB

145
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,950
cable and if to figure out the image

146
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,540
that has the weird name on it and you're

147
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,610
like which image is it or you can do the

148
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,930
other one that I often do that I hate

149
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,790
which is okay this got uploaded to the

150
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,830
cloud right didn't it didn't it and then

151
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,760
you go and look and you're like why

152
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,130
isn't it uploaded the cloud so you can

153
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,010
snap images you can put on captions on

154
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,270
them and upload them directly your

155
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,190
hackaday i/o projects I think the

156
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,229
biggest power of hack at i/o is those

157
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:49,300
project logs so you can document it

158
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,890
along the way because once again I like

159
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,830
to not just see the finished project

160
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,460
definitely check that one out

161
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,760
Oh as my cursor been going crazy the

162
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,699
whole time you're welcome

163
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,949
all right I think I turned the cursor

164
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,289
off ah has anyone here heard the hack in

165
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,159
a podcast whoo so elegant and I did this

166
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:13,949
really foolish thing at in December were

167
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,229
like let's do a Year in Review podcast

168
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:19,889
and it was it got a lot of warm response

169
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,269
and I thank you for everyone that has

170
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:22,949
encouraged us through it we committed to

171
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,319
doing a podcast every single week and

172
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,419
we've done it I think every single week

173
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,969
but two weeks is Elliott here right now

174
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,369
he was here before he's looking around

175
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:32,939
somewhere

176
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:35,039
Elliott spent an amazing amount of time

177
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,629
editing this thing and he has a really

178
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,489
good ear for the audio side of things

179
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:40,469
and so it sounds great because of

180
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:42,539
Elliott's hard work we're publishing

181
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,699
about 300 articles per month it's

182
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,679
difficult to keep up I love doing it but

183
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,269
I understand there are other things in

184
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:50,159
the hackaday in your lives this is a

185
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,809
great way to spend about an hour a week

186
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:55,079
catching up on you know a dozen 16 17

187
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,360
ish articles and just kind of looking we

188
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,729
go over the things that were written

189
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:01,169
about a hackaday but also just the wider

190
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:03,719
hacker sphere what's going on and really

191
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:08,159
love doing that the pac chats are

192
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:09,869
something we do weekly on hackaday i/o

193
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:12,329
and we bring in experts from industry to

194
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:13,860
talk about what we do what they're doing

195
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,599
and I think it's really special because

196
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,429
often times you just don't get this view

197
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:19,769
this under-the-hood view of what people

198
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:21,719
are doing and some of the my favorite

199
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:24,599
ones that Dan Maloney lined up this year

200
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,610
Dana Lewis came in and hosted a hacked

201
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,209
chat she is the one who launched the

202
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:33,929
open sorry its hacking diabetes so it's

203
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:35,909
the open artificial pancreas project

204
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,589
four people are type one diabetes that

205
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:40,050
need a insulin pump and need better

206
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,849
options and more options that might be

207
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,829
available commercially there's a great

208
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,199
one on photography there's one on cube

209
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,439
SATs Quinn dunkey if you know her from a

210
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,699
few of the articles that she's on a

211
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,829
hackaday also has a fantastic channel on

212
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:54,329
machining a youtube channel and

213
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:55,949
machining came in and talked about

214
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:58,019
setting up machines in your shop I know

215
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,059
Dan's always looking for people to host

216
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:02,489
that so if you have ideas or if you are

217
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:04,229
interested in hosting please reach out

218
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:06,449
to him it's I'm gonna give your email

219
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:08,759
address out dan I'm sorry Dan Maloney at

220
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,499
hackaday comm hope they're he's right

221
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:12,059
there he's a great guy I talked to him

222
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,490
on the phone there also we

223
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,139
wonderful contests we have this really

224
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,580
big contest you might have heard of last

225
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,800
night called the hackaday prize which

226
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,740
but what wonderful winners last night

227
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,720
but we we run other projects our other

228
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,729
contests throughout the year and two of

229
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:28,470
them that really caught my eye and did

230
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,990
way better than I thought they would

231
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,399
really amaze me where the circuit

232
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,289
sculpture contest and the beautiful

233
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,479
hardware contest so the beautiful

234
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,309
hardware contest I didn't think it would

235
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,719
be very interesting because the

236
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,610
constraints were so simple it was like

237
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,289
okay take a cool picture of your

238
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,600
hardware like that's just I mean how do

239
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,279
you even start there but of course there

240
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,250
are people who are trying to take

241
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,600
amazing images and so these are three of

242
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,220
the winners from that contest this is

243
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,830
look look at that that's electronic so

244
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,149
this and then these are from the circuit

245
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:58,529
sculpture contest and that's Kelly

246
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:02,310
Heaton and I see Kelly right there and I

247
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,279
mean it's just amazing we take things

248
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,490
that could just be really boring Green

249
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,550
Square circuit boards and turn them into

250
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,589
something that far transcends what their

251
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:15,570
original use was meant to be of the

252
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,029
original design was meant to be and I

253
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,709
really love those so go check out those

254
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:31,079
two contests let's see alright well

255
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,570
let's go to that slide so I would like

256
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,950
to talk a little bit about all of the

257
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,510
editorial we've done this year and all

258
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,089
of the 15 years of hackaday but one

259
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:40,680
thing that keeps striking me is the

260
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,140
amazing growth that we've seen and the

261
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,000
ability to just pursue our mission a lot

262
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,829
more closely over the last six years and

263
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:49,740
that started when supply frame bought

264
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,890
hackaday and started making it a making

265
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,240
real point of supporting the community

266
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,100
so one of the most important things to

267
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,720
me is that supply frame is safeguarded

268
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,149
hackaday editorial independence so we

269
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:03,420
are we have all the freedom that we want

270
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,220
to pursue topics in the way that we

271
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,600
think that they should be pursued and we

272
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,310
don't feel pressure there and that

273
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,540
should not be understated that is

274
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,980
something that is a very special in the

275
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,500
world today but the other thing is they

276
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,270
have had amazing support for the

277
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,490
community from building out the hackaday

278
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,339
i/o website so we have a place virtually

279
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,279
to get together to launching the

280
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,260
hackaday prize and other contests that

281
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,870
try and promote engineering and

282
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,600
making it a priority to have live events

283
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,890
like the hackaday super conference

284
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,770
events all over the world and also by

285
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,540
sponsoring events that supply frame

286
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,760
doesn't produce the also support the

287
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,680
community and I just wanted to take a

288
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,180
moment to say thank you to supply frame

289
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,920
for that everything the hackaday has

290
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,240
been doing the last six years wouldn't

291
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,740
be possible without it so let's give

292
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:56,490
them a round of applause okay so this is

293
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,350
this might get a little long because I

294
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,820
went back and looked at all the articles

295
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,839
we wrote for the last year and it's

296
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,870
amazing so the first thing is if you

297
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,000
haven't been reading the Friday 7 a.m.

298
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,150
Pacific article slot for the last 15

299
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,310
weeks or so you should because Jonathan

300
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,420
Bennett has been throwing down an

301
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,580
amazing series with the weakened

302
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,520
insecurity I think as I don't know what

303
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,529
you want to call this computer people a

304
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,860
lot everyone in our lives looks to us to

305
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,180
explain the things that they're hearing

306
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,550
about and a lot of times it's these

307
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,420
security vulnerabilities and they're

308
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,620
wondering like what is that and the

309
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,330
thing is we need to be informed about

310
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,580
that and it's hard to keep up with this

311
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,290
is a really good consumable way every

312
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,940
week to get like the little overview

313
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,800
like what do you need to know and I mean

314
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,330
Jonathan's also really good at putting

315
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,620
the breadcrumbs in there like if you

316
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,000
need to know deeper about this where do

317
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,810
you go for it

318
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,520
so I think that's excellent take a look

319
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,520
at it our editorial goals this year one

320
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,589
of the biggest ones is to take a look at

321
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,450
what the wider media is covering and

322
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,339
pull out those engineering stories that

323
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,920
aren't being told I it's happened to all

324
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,450
kinds of times this year but I pulled

325
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,560
out one that kind of starts at the

326
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,330
beginning of the year you may have heard

327
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,070
that the media was talking about these

328
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,900
hypersonic weapons and they're saying

329
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,850
hypersonic they're saying scramjet

330
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,140
they're saying all these words and they

331
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,490
weren't really explaining any of it and

332
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,190
Tom Nardi took got onto that one and

333
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,450
wrote a really long article and realized

334
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,430
that all these terms were getting mixed

335
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,930
up and they really didn't have anything

336
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,950
to do with each other

337
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,750
so you wrote this story which is really

338
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,900
about like a projectile launch that it's

339
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,480
put out from from high altitude and can

340
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,600
be guided and is a hypersonic craft but

341
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,459
then also realized that the scramjet is

342
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,050
a completely different thing and it's an

343
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,880
engine style that operates at really

344
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,190
high speeds so high you can't really

345
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,750
have a turbine in there and it's like

346
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,470
the

347
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,770
geometry of how the air path moves makes

348
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,050
it work and so he looked at the history

349
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,480
behind that and and why it's so hard I

350
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,560
thought that was a good engineering

351
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,910
story and then you may have heard of

352
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,620
radiation alarms going off from some

353
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,830
accident in northern Russia and people

354
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,510
are guessing that this is actually a

355
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,390
flying missile that is powered by some

356
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,140
kind of nuclear reactor and again I

357
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,490
think this is yeah this is also Tom so

358
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,810
when Tom started looking at this he

359
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,730
realized this is not a new idea this has

360
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,320
been around a long time and kind of dug

361
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,420
up the story of testing after the Second

362
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,520
World War in the United States and and

363
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,050
how they figured out was probably a bad

364
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,320
idea to have a flying reactor and then

365
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,480
if you think about things like the

366
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,900
Fukushima disaster there's a lot of

367
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,460
question marks that came up about like

368
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,500
how are we monitoring ready radiation

369
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,640
how can we be sure that we're getting

370
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,910
the information about it and so Lou and

371
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,470
des picked up on this and said oh we've

372
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,930
seen all of these air quality monitors

373
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,720
and environmental monitors and radiation

374
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,940
monitors systems being put out on the

375
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,440
Internet networks that people can build

376
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,390
and put their own nodes out and so he

377
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,880
went and looked up all of the networks

378
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,910
that he could and and found that what we

379
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,680
were at least from these networks they

380
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,730
confirmed that what was being reported

381
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,220
that this was not a hazard in places

382
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,900
outside of the immediate area were true

383
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,990
and I think it's just an interesting the

384
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,820
first time at least that I've seen that

385
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,980
these that we've had a problem and these

386
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,780
open source networks have been used to

387
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,250
kind of confirm that the official

388
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,200
information that we're getting is right

389
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,850
and that's that's kind of a powerful

390
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,180
thing I like that of course looking at

391
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,420
things like this car is no longer being

392
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,520
sold how interesting is that well not

393
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,410
very interesting except for the

394
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,820
technology that went into it and the

395
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,740
choices that went into it should have

396
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,770
made it a really popular but I guess

397
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,170
yeah all gasp alternative and Roger

398
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,400
chick dug into that and said what

399
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,110
choices in the design and what choices

400
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,910
in the way that was rolled out and the

401
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,860
time period it was rolled out made this

402
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,160
successful or not successful dan Maloney

403
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,610
has been doing let the $50 ham column so

404
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,200
if you're into amateur radio he's trying

405
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,780
to build inexpensive on things that let

406
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,209
you kind of like level up your skills in

407
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:52,589
amateur radio and while he was working

408
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:55,139
on this this story in Ohio came out the

409
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,119
whole neighborhood couldn't get the key

410
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:59,429
fob to unlock their car to work he's

411
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:01,079
like what's all that so you think about

412
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,209
it okay well there's our you know

413
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,129
somebody's jamming and that's regulated

414
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:06,749
so you should like roll up to their

415
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:08,389
house and slap the handcuffs on right

416
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:11,670
well first of all whose house is it and

417
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,860
the municipality was thinking about like

418
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,259
shutting off power to like one block at

419
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:16,829
a time

420
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:18,629
to try and find out where this problem

421
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:21,119
was and of course the the great story

422
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,470
here is the amateur radio community is

423
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,220
self-policing

424
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,529
so a ham got out and basically did like

425
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,240
a fox hunt to find where this

426
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,670
interference is coming from ended up

427
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,809
knocking on the door of the house and

428
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:32,369
the guys like oh yeah I I built my own

429
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:34,889
home automation system I didn't know

430
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:36,420
that it was a problem and and the ham

431
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,579
goes and says well look this is this is

432
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,829
what's wrong let's pick this fix this

433
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:42,600
together and you know instead of going

434
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,579
to jail you have people who are now you

435
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:47,040
know able to say oh watch out for this

436
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,899
this is an issue and it ends up becoming

437
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,480
a public service rather than you know

438
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,499
chasing after problem children I guess I

439
00:15:55,499 --> 00:15:57,389
don't know if you heard of this guy Elon

440
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,509
Musk but he makes really big claims and

441
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:03,720
he he said I bought this company and

442
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,490
it's gonna let you compete control

443
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,199
everything with your mind and Maya

444
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,790
posture is like whoa whoa whoa whoa

445
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,589
let's let's just unpack that for a

446
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:11,910
minute and she went and looked at the

447
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,970
company and and the technology they have

448
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,589
for brain computer interfaces and said

449
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:18,480
there is novel things here but let's

450
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,129
really talk about a serious time line

451
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:22,079
and you know let's kind of ground to

452
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,970
these claims so that we don't have

453
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,740
unrealistic expectations and I think

454
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,790
controlling those expectations

455
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,100
especially you know wider consumer

456
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,369
electronics market is really important

457
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:35,519
Ted yopo Ted are you here right now I

458
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,160
think Ted's badge hacking this is an

459
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,079
insanely good article this may be my

460
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,049
favorite article of the decade go and

461
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:44,610
look at this actually it's not his next

462
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,939
one might be so if you remember when LED

463
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:49,619
light bulbs came out I was not a huge

464
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:50,850
fan of complex arresting because you

465
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,499
know they feel like warm up and I'm like

466
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:54,720
LED they're on immediately they're great

467
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,220
they're low-power they're wonderful and

468
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,990
they last a hundred thousand hours it

469
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,939
says right on the package and then who

470
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:01,919
here had a light bulb burn out in like

471
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,900
six months or a couple years

472
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,760
like everyone and you're like ah I threw

473
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,380
that package away how am I gonna get

474
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,540
this so he dug into it and said why were

475
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,010
they making those claims what's actually

476
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,290
causing these light bulbs to die why is

477
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,450
it when I put a new light bulb next to

478
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,859
one of my old light bulbs they're not

479
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,240
the same brightness anymore

480
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,880
kind of unpacked some of the marketing

481
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,280
BS that goes into those and and gave us

482
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,420
a dose of reality they're still great

483
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,829
use that use these bulbs don't go back

484
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,410
to incandescent he also did another one

485
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,990
that said I had these 30 year old roles

486
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,940
of SMD parts and I can't get solder to

487
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,440
reflow onto them they just kind of like

488
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,200
jump off the board and did a bunch of

489
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,030
side-by-side testing some of my favorite

490
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,700
things of these types of Ted's articles

491
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,800
and figured out you could sand the oxide

492
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,130
layer off of the solder and get it to

493
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,900
work just by rubbing it on a piece of

494
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,550
paper so as long as you don't have

495
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,130
hundreds in used to populate you can

496
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,250
hand rework and rework them we've been

497
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,840
following stories that are near and dear

498
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,910
to us so a lot of raspberry pie stories

499
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,760
did anybody here have a 3.3 volt rail

500
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,810
died on their Raspberry Pi 3 plus no

501
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,550
nobody that's great so it turns out on

502
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,050
the head on the pin header if you

503
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,400
accidentally saw it or if you

504
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,440
accidentally shorted two pins you'd kill

505
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,690
the 3.3 volt rail and I think the cool

506
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,190
thing about these next few slides is

507
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,140
raspberry PI's been really cool about

508
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,240
acknowledging this and talking about why

509
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,470
the design is wrong and what they're

510
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,780
going to do about it so another one is

511
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,990
they had the Raspberry Pi 4 came out

512
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,180
this year and they said we started

513
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,790
hearing these reports that if you used a

514
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,770
charging cable if you used a really nice

515
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,540
expensive charging cable it wouldn't

516
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,570
work and Maya posture dug into that and

517
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,970
we looked at exactly the USBC spec and

518
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,400
said oh it's these Emaar cables where

519
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,900
they actually have a chip in either end

520
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,610
of the cable and they don't work because

521
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,550
the specification is not right and Roger

522
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,680
change I've done that and said oh you

523
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,420
know what it's not just the Raspberry Pi

524
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,580
like this is a really hard specification

525
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,860
to get into and the reason I'm not I'm

526
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,330
not trying to drag Raspberry Pi through

527
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,860
the mud we love raspberry pi it's really

528
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,540
cool to have inexpensive single board

529
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,990
Linux computers but I think the fact

530
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,660
that USB C is what we're moving towards

531
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,490
and that it's hard to implement so hard

532
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,260
that an established company that has a

533
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,250
lot of products out in the

534
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,040
field is you know fell afoul of it means

535
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,570
we need to tell a better story of like

536
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,570
where are the tested and proven designs

537
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,090
how do you test your equipment to make

538
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,920
sure it's compliant and can we make

539
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,480
these things available so that we don't

540
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,760
just make this mistake over and over and

541
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,320
over again and I think that's one of the

542
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,330
places that a kadhi can really excel is

543
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,640
by highlighting proven designs and

544
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,430
promoting you know sharing your testing

545
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,570
protocols openly I think the space race

546
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,490
is one of the greatest ways to get

547
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,250
people excited about science and so I

548
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,630
like to see that going on again we've

549
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,860
been doing a lot of coverage of that I

550
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,450
hope you're enjoying that I certainly am

551
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,400
it's not the first time we've had a

552
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,170
space race though we had one you know a

553
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,210
half a century ago and there are still a

554
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,580
ton of stories to tell about that I just

555
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,260
pulled this one out we've continued to

556
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,850
do our profiles in science which are

557
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,810
finding you know technologists and

558
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,480
mathematicians and chemists that are

559
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,220
that have moved technology forward this

560
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,050
is a great one about the v2 rocket the

561
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,730
Redstone program which could not have

562
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,520
gotten into orbit without a new

563
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,910
formulation for fuel and it was a person

564
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,790
from my home state of North Dakota grew

565
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,590
up in a tiny town I don't like 25 people

566
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,650
that came up with this formulation we

567
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,910
are really happy to have a ton of deep

568
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,930
experience on hackaday and so every time

569
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,580
a new programming language comes out I'm

570
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,380
like okay who has some experience in

571
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,760
this programming language I can dig into

572
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,840
it and tell me what it's all about

573
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,090
because I you know I'm interested I

574
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,280
don't have the background and so if you

575
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,390
want to use V who's heard of V a few

576
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,710
people but now you can learn a lot more

577
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,600
about it because of Ben James it's not

578
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,780
just that language my Epoque she must

579
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,400
have my number because I've committed

580
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,500
all of the sins on buffer overflows and

581
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,990
C that you could possibly commit I don't

582
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,110
know why that that termination character

583
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,330
in the C string arrays it gets me every

584
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,700
time but if I switched over to Ada it's

585
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,310
so tightly tight typed so tightly typed

586
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,110
that it would never let you do that you

587
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,180
can't buffer all of overflow on it so if

588
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,950
you have problems and C and you want the

589
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,500
compiler to really rein you in Maya will

590
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,540
convince you that ADA is the place to go

591
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,240
and the new C standard has been

592
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,429
formalized do you all know what that

593
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:30,550
means

594
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,160
no I'm sure not so go and check out Sven

595
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,830
Gregory he said hey here's the new

596
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,180
things that are interesting and some of

597
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,010
the things that aren't interesting but

598
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,440
at least you can stay in the know we

599
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,270
have a lot of writers writing every

600
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,220
single month and I really like that

601
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,010
because we have people that are experts

602
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,420
in certain different areas and allows us

603
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,190
to really for them it's just normal

604
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,170
stuff but for us we don't get to look at

605
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,930
it very much and so uh Brian field

606
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,750
actually works on power grid and did a

607
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,000
bunch of articles this year just looking

608
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,560
at like for this this one's like what

609
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,540
are the poles made of what why are they

610
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,530
as tall as they are and how do they

611
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,640
leverage insulators to keep the high

612
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,170
voltage apart what kind of equipment

613
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,060
they used to step up and step down for

614
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,220
those transmissions but also when

615
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,570
current events things happen like there

616
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,200
was a huge power outage in all of

617
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,820
Argentina and also part of Paraguay and

618
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,640
Uruguay and the reporting the official

619
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,050
announcements of what happened coming

620
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,340
out there were like really sparse but

621
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,780
because of his experience he was able to

622
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,730
like fill in all the blanks on it really

623
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,350
tell a comprehensive story once again

624
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,240
something that was reported you know the

625
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,190
wider news but it was reported as there

626
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,960
was a power outage and now there's not

627
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,670
and he actually looked at it and said

628
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,980
this is um you know things like cold

629
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,870
starting facilities like how hard is it

630
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,610
to start up power generation once it

631
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,840
stopped like that's a really interesting

632
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,210
story and we're happy to have him write

633
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,750
about it alright I probably have like 10

634
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,800
more slides on this but I'm going to

635
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,650
move on just for time oh yeah we have

636
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,240
plenty of time don't worry so

637
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,210
PACA Day started in September 5th of

638
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,060
2004 was the first article published on

639
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,820
hackaday and I think it's amazing to

640
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,280
look back we wrote an article and

641
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,760
unfortunately you just cannot cover in

642
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,440
one article all the things that happened

643
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,510
in 15 years so I thought hey state of

644
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,590
the hackaday I'll cover all the things

645
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,230
that happened in 15 years no that's

646
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,930
really hard too so um being someone that

647
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,430
is always jealous when speakers have

648
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,620
really good stats and graphs and stuff I

649
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,510
was like I can pull some stats so I have

650
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,180
I have a fun little sad thing so five

651
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,340
and a half thousand days we wrote almost

652
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,480
35,000 articles we've received over

653
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,310
900,000 comments it's amazing and I'm

654
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,290
always floored how many times we write

655
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,910
something and some will be in the

656
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:43,600
comments that said

657
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,980
I worked on that program I work at that

658
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,690
company or that's what I do in my day

659
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,419
job and gives all kinds of interesting

660
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,549
insight to that I'm going back to my you

661
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:53,080
know the wider hackaday community is

662
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,090
there just waiting for for some way to

663
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,880
cross paths and you know when you know

664
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,110
something you want to share your

665
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,390
knowledge I think that's really cool one

666
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,620
of the things I do hear from people

667
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,780
though is like oh you know back when

668
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,429
hack edebe wrote one article day that

669
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:08,049
was the real hackaday and so I looked

670
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:10,630
into that and I said how long was that

671
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,070
when did we actually write one hack it

672
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,480
because it certainly has not been for a

673
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,909
while so I pulled every single day for

674
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:18,580
15 years and you can see the most we

675
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,220
ever published was 16 in one day and you

676
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,600
know we had a good run here but there's

677
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,370
there's some noise in there so this is

678
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,770
the one baseline we get a little bit

679
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,630
above that so I thought okay if we do

680
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,210
months by year instead we get a little

681
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,760
better thing there and then I say okay

682
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,909
years so we do have a pretty close

683
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,250
baseline there on years and I said all

684
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,070
right well let's actually look at the

685
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,360
number of distinct days so this is 1070

686
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,070
three days out of that five and a half

687
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,990
thousand days we published exactly one

688
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,840
article and you can see this is more

689
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,730
what we're at right now we publish eight

690
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,890
every weekend and we published somewhere

691
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,590
between ten eleven or twelve on the

692
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,880
weekdays and it's kind of the modern

693
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,030
hackaday but still didn't quite mean

694
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,710
much to me as far as the stats go so I

695
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,070
looked at baseball and they have a they

696
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,960
have an on-base percentage right and so

697
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,400
that's really what we need so I put

698
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,260
together the solo hack percentage and

699
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,250
you can see that in 2004 we had a

700
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,770
perfect solo hack percentage every one

701
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,400
of those days September through December

702
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,289
exactly one hack today if per day but by

703
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:29,110
2015 less than half of the days were one

704
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,030
hack day so our solo hack percentage was

705
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,850
very low and by 2009 it's almost almost

706
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,210
gone so we like to write articles I

707
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,419
started reading in 2005 and I read every

708
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:42,460
single word in the hackaday article and

709
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,870
I clicked through and read every single

710
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,130
word in the articles that they were

711
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,860
running and I learned just a ton from

712
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,230
that and yet I was still left wanting

713
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,440
more and so I think if you're into you

714
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,909
know hardware especially but really just

715
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:57,340
the wider technology in general

716
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,720
you'd like to be entertained and you'd

717
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,250
like to find things to write and so

718
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,660
that's why we're running more than one

719
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,540
hackaday is people are interested in new

720
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,020
stuff going and looking at the number of

721
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,720
authors I think it's no surprise that

722
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,460
them as we published more articles we

723
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,560
had more authors at this point we're up

724
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,270
to about 20 to 30 maybe 25 to 30 authors

725
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,640
per month to give us that wide different

726
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,350
background but what was really

727
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,360
interesting to me and Ellie and I

728
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,470
disagree on this I think this is a

729
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,630
really low number but in 15 years

730
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,900
35,000 articles we've only ever had a

731
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,300
hundred and fifty-seven published

732
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,780
authors that's really incredible

733
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,910
and these people generally have better

734
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,890
things to do with their lives they have

735
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,570
really interesting jobs they're doing

736
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:47,740
important things and they make time to

737
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,120
write for hackaday because they also

738
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,620
come from the Hackney community and they

739
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,870
also know what it is to have on this

740
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,400
form of entertainment and this form of

741
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,500
Education and really want to give back

742
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,440
so I just like to recognize these 157

743
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,700
people and give them a big round of

744
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,780
applause

745
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,940
[Applause]

746
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,700
so in looking at our 15 years the thing

747
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,490
that really struck us is the way that

748
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,170
the technology especially the hardware

749
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:18,200
has changed so it used to be a lot more

750
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,420
difficult I'd like to say kids these

751
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,340
days have it so easy except for it's not

752
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,280
just kids we we all benefit from this it

753
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,930
changed so quickly that it didn't take

754
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,540
an entire generation to get to this

755
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,810
point but if you go back to 2008 which

756
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,340
is still not even when we started about

757
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,960
four years later and look at what it

758
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,810
took to build a little robot with Wi-Fi

759
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:43,670
who here owned the wrt54g here hacked on

760
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,410
it at all in some way shape or form

761
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,270
right so if you're someone that hacked

762
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,700
on it you will recognize right here the

763
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,080
serial the DB DB 6 DB 9 DB somethin

764
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,520
connector that breaks out the serial

765
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,440
port that gives you interactivity with

766
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,630
it but you had to have a whole router on

767
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,680
there and then I means you have to power

768
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,910
a whole router and there were just a lot

769
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,860
of problems that went into it you go to

770
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,000
2009 and this is a Arduino form-factor

771
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,440
Wemo board so it's a esp8266 I believe

772
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,900
you get it for a few dollars it's gonna

773
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,460
have the same kind of motor driver of

774
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,930
course motor drivers are easier to get

775
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,350
these days

776
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,600
but look over here you have an entire

777
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,160
user interface that you don't have to

778
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,570
build yourself that your outlet that

779
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,610
every one that you could possibly put

780
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,430
this robot hand into already has and in

781
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,660
this case if you look really close on

782
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,250
the screen it's using the Google

783
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,770
assistant voice commands so we have like

784
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,230
a voice controlled robot over Wi-Fi for

785
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,580
way less than we did when we were

786
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,590
putting a router on it

787
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,950
unbelievable of course isn't just Wi-Fi

788
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,930
that we're interested in people wanted

789
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,640
to put cellular on it and that goes way

790
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,800
back as well but it used to be you had a

791
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,660
whole cell phone so you'd put your whole

792
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,730
cell phone on the robot and then of

793
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,900
course what's the problem with putting a

794
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,370
cell phone in the robot how do you

795
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,350
connect your hardware to it right and

796
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,050
who here really misses the days of USB

797
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,320
on-the-go oh what a horrible standard I

798
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,400
mean there was some good thing I

799
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,350
remember I had the yo-yo board that you

800
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,790
could connect to there like broke it out

801
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,010
and that was okay but it still was just

802
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,620
a fight to get that stuff to happen when

803
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,690
we fast forward to 2019 and carry sharp

804
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,090
glass wrote an article called choosing

805
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,990
the Goldilocks cell module and so it

806
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,780
not just like here's the thing to put

807
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,429
sell on it but it's like here's all of

808
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:27,080
the different choices that you have that

809
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,940
you can buy right now for it's still

810
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,679
pretty inexpensive and get it to work on

811
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:31,370
your device

812
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,410
that's an amazing chasm to come in just

813
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:37,309
11 years this one is an autonomous robot

814
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,940
from 2006 so they did exist before you

815
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,780
know.com 4.0 or whatever rat some of the

816
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,950
things interesting about this look at

817
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,780
all of the batteries I guess it's really

818
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,520
low resolution in there I mean cameras

819
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,380
weren't that good in 2006 either this is

820
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:51,860
crazy

821
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,420
alright so there's just a ton of

822
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,950
double-a batteries on this thing all

823
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,630
over the place and then I'm pretty sure

824
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,260
this is a GPS module I'm not sure this

825
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,050
is maybe Wi-Fi something anyway it's

826
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,090
difficult to do these things this is the

827
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,520
donkey car I saw this at Maker Faire Bay

828
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,960
Area in 2017

829
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,440
it's an autonomous driving vehicle on

830
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,800
powered by Raspberry Pi 3 so like $35

831
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,770
Linux computer right it has this camera

832
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,720
right here which the board is made to

833
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,550
work with the camera this car is

834
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,410
actually looking at the track ahead of

835
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,970
it on the camera and making driving

836
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,830
choices based on that on this little

837
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,929
computer I mean I know you live in the

838
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,280
same future that I do but it's

839
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,990
incredible to think about how far we've

840
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,910
come on these things the other thing is

841
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,800
look at look down here you got rid of

842
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,809
all of those double-a batteries and you

843
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:40,400
just put a tight little lithium pack on

844
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,530
there and so you have to look into it

845
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,860
and say alright that the 18 650 that

846
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,900
cell that we love to use for lithium

847
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,000
batteries these days that I went and

848
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,830
looked it it started being produced in

849
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,140
the 90s and being put into laptop

850
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,700
batteries and so we do see a ton of

851
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,220
projects but they're usually pulling

852
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,840
laptop batteries out and then you have

853
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,520
to be like okay how am I going to not

854
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,740
blow this battery up when I charge it

855
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,440
and how do I charge it and like you

856
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,000
spend half your time on your project

857
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,340
getting the battery to work and you know

858
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,500
now we can just go because of the RC

859
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,870
field and buy a drone battery that you

860
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,030
know has all kinds of power density in

861
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,620
it and you can buy a charger that you're

862
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,090
pretty sure is not going to catch it on

863
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,760
fire and in general be be a lot safer

864
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,320
than I have been around some of those

865
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,360
boosted boards or the the electric

866
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,710
skateboards when somebody punctured

867
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,929
themselves that's some scary stuff watch

868
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,710
out for that alright and who

869
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,460
thought you would have been able to

870
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,130
build your own machine tool like that is

871
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,559
something ten years ago I mean really

872
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,820
ten years ago you would have thought I

873
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,299
can't get into that that's too tough and

874
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:45,250
well I guess more than ten you somewhere

875
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:45,610
in there

876
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,250
so we at RepRap come along I rep rep

877
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,809
really revolutionized that and said you

878
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:51,760
know what let's put motors on stuff and

879
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,470
let's make it possible for people to use

880
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,940
them and build high precision precision

881
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,460
things but still you know you had to

882
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,559
like get into that community and hope

883
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,880
you could convince someone to send you

884
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,830
the original parts or you could do I

885
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,419
think they call them rep straps where

886
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:06,610
you try to like hand make those parts to

887
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,020
the point where they could then print

888
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,029
something better and build build your

889
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:13,510
machine well now I hope you've seen Josh

890
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:17,250
Joshua Vasquez is Jubilee tool changing

891
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:24,850
application we have experienced linear

892
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,620
rails something like this precision

893
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,690
rails right there you have the ability

894
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,960
to get very high power and high

895
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,120
precision motors for incredibly low

896
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,559
price you have good examples on 3d

897
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,679
printed connectors for them and 3d

898
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,210
printed jigs and how to how to build

899
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,490
that it's like not just the hardware

900
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,200
that goes into this but like the entire

901
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,270
ecosystem of how do you build things

902
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,799
that are gonna work well and don't have

903
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,279
backlash in them and don't have flex

904
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,480
it's really amazing to see that it's

905
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,559
come come so far I am looking at where

906
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,940
we're going from here and it's hard to

907
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,370
imagine because these advancements seem

908
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:06,789
to keep keep accelerating but I think

909
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:08,169
the place they're at right now is kind

910
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:10,929
of like I was walking here this morning

911
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:13,029
and talking to someone about robotics

912
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:14,110
they were doing and I said it's it's

913
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,809
kind of like hash include' robot look at

914
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:18,190
that point it really is is getting to

915
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,090
the point where you like have an

916
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,850
existing design and you you wish it and

917
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,200
you wish it to be part of your project

918
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,289
and it can this is one of my favorites

919
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:27,909
you can find on hackaday oh these are

920
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:30,010
time-of-flight sensors so really

921
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,260
inexpensive because of economies of

922
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,539
scale and they've put three of these on

923
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:37,630
this little piece of circular PCB that

924
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,840
spins and created a very low cost but

925
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,480
still totally usable lidar called X

926
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,730
lidar that's incredible

927
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,000
I look at what we're what got us to this

928
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,490
point and it was good ideas so you know

929
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,080
somebody spent a lot of time just making

930
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,680
this AVR chip talk to this existing unit

931
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,750
and you can bet that like getting the

932
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,010
libraries to work on this was

933
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,800
non-trivial but everyone looked at it

934
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,900
that's what I want I want GPS on this I

935
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,540
want a a geocaching box remember those

936
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,460
geocaching that was a good time I want

937
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,710
to do some geocaching and I need GPS on

938
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,840
that and boy I wish I could do this but

939
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,400
that seems like a lot of work and so

940
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,960
someone comes along and says that is a

941
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,219
lot of work maybe we should make that

942
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,989
into a module and you can just slap on

943
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:22,030
top of your microcontroller breakout

944
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,469
board and oh we'll also give you a

945
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:25,179
library that will just work when you use

946
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,420
it and decade of that does align and

947
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,820
brings us really a long way to the point

948
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,850
where we're getting there in software as

949
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,920
well if you think about what Arduino did

950
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,159
Arduino came in and said you know you

951
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,219
shouldn't have to be a tool chain expert

952
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,210
you shouldn't have to be able to write

953
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:46,060
your own make files in order to do

954
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,489
something on a microcontroller and you

955
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:51,370
shouldn't have to be you know a computer

956
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,500
scientist to connect a temperature

957
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,630
sensor up to something and then be able

958
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,450
to echo that out on the serial port and

959
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,820
a lot of people said oh you know this

960
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,710
isn't real embedded systems and you

961
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,990
should be counting cycles but the thing

962
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,590
is it opened up the economy to a lot

963
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,910
more people who wouldn't have gotten

964
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,190
into it and what that does is you

965
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,230
identify people who are going to be

966
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,760
microcontroller experts then maybe

967
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,370
wouldn't have been exposed to it and

968
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,170
they those people come in and are like

969
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,880
oh this library is kind of janky I wish

970
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,230
it was better and then they contribute

971
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,670
back to the open source and so what we

972
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,860
end up is getting like exponential

973
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,840
growth on the ability to build good

974
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,160
products and to make them work for

975
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,080
everyone I think we're getting to

976
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,780
another kind of fast-forward moment with

977
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,820
that and I think it's in the micro

978
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,710
Python and of course the circuit Python

979
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,070
which is based on that lineage because

980
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,810
when Arduino first came in it was

981
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,480
running on like the 880 mega 8 it wasn't

982
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,250
super fast it didn't have a ton of flash

983
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,010
space but then the embedded systems

984
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,680
caught up and now like the teensy 4 was

985
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,410
released as like a 600 megahertz clock

986
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,840
in there like it's amazing and so you

987
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,079
don't

988
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:00,999
notice any kind of like wrapper overhead

989
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:04,180
on that anymore now micro Python it has

990
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,160
a definite speed hit to it but think of

991
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,229
how many more people have been exposed

992
00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:10,299
to Python than have been exposed to C++

993
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:14,619
and so I just took two examples open cm3

994
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:17,170
is like an open source library for the s

995
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,390
am 32 and a lot of other controllers

996
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,579
this is an example that you can't read

997
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,690
at all sorry about that

998
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,799
of using a USB mouse and USB keyboard

999
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:28,930
with those devices and there's like a

1000
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,579
bunch of magic numbers in there so like

1001
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:34,989
GPIO numbers and you know just stuff

1002
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:36,700
that you're like what is this okay I'll

1003
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,160
copy it and make it work and micro

1004
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,539
Python comes along and they're like oh

1005
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:44,829
hey here is CD CHCs and CD chid it's

1006
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:46,660
like one-liners that turn those on to

1007
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,369
turn those off and somebody else is

1008
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:49,930
taking care of all those magic numbers

1009
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,400
under the hood that's really

1010
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,349
transformative because it is like

1011
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:54,940
software include to make your hardware

1012
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,519
work and I think that the future is

1013
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,739
gonna see that just about anyone who

1014
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:02,079
becomes a hardware person and and just

1015
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,339
about any hardware person becomes a

1016
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:04,420
software person I think these are

1017
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,239
benefits for all a microcosm of this is

1018
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,999
the badge that we saw at the Hecate

1019
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:12,039
super conference so it's based on an

1020
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:14,680
FPGA and as you can see the FPGA becomes

1021
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,059
whatever Hardware you want so there's a

1022
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:18,190
couple of risk 5 cores you throw them in

1023
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,749
there you do your risk 5 stuff you don't

1024
00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:21,190
really think about it once it's up and

1025
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,140
running you can make the interface any

1026
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,289
interfaces do you want to work on that

1027
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:28,559
but even beyond this it's only becoming

1028
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,890
I think widely adopted at this point

1029
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,660
outside of just industry that's building

1030
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,519
products that has FPGA is in it because

1031
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:38,469
we have a fully open source tool chain

1032
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:40,749
on that and I think the work that has

1033
00:37:40,749 --> 00:37:42,130
gone in by the people that are

1034
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,690
contributing to those projects cannot be

1035
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,140
understated with vendor tools it's

1036
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,049
difficult to custom hook them into your

1037
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:51,789
own process these so if you want to

1038
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:54,039
script things if you want I mean if you

1039
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,390
want to do anything other than what's

1040
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,640
traditionally been imagined on the FPGA

1041
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,680
it's difficult to do with vendor tools

1042
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,359
when you open it up to the open source

1043
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,219
tools it's your playground you can do

1044
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:04,329
whatever you want get it under the hood

1045
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:05,650
and build that and that's just gonna

1046
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,269
allow people to innovate and I think

1047
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:09,050
we're gonna see these in a ton more

1048
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,110
our products because of it and I'm

1049
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,790
really excited about that you shouldn't

1050
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,190
be locked into whatever your product

1051
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,960
functionality is just because it was

1052
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,940
shipped out the door we have the ability

1053
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,440
now to change things in the field and

1054
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,780
and and that's where we're moving the

1055
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,460
other thing on the hacker new super

1056
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,410
carpets badge is distributed engineering

1057
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,260
team and I was particularly happy to

1058
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,050
hear the axiom team accept their award

1059
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,190
for the hackaday prize last night

1060
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,930
because they said this is the first time

1061
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,610
the three of us have met and I knew I

1062
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,320
had I knew I had this slide in here and

1063
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,090
I'm like I hope I'm not just full of BS

1064
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,330
but this badge team is from all over the

1065
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,640
world and we put together a how could a

1066
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,970
project on hackaday do that had a chat

1067
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,410
room in there and you go and look at

1068
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,090
people getting to know each other and

1069
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,560
working through problems and talking

1070
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,850
about what's going on with all the code

1071
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,040
if you're working in an office with

1072
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,560
other people chances are you're already

1073
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,400
interacting with them virtually you're

1074
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,290
on a slack channel or a discord channel

1075
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,440
and yeah you do see them in person but I

1076
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,900
think the default is I can always get to

1077
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,280
them through the screen in the keyboard

1078
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,150
and so to remove the the close proximity

1079
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,120
physically I think is not as foreign as

1080
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,100
it was five years ago and definitely not

1081
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,250
as it was 10 years ago and so hackaday

1082
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,660
i/o is a great place to work on these

1083
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,240
distributed projects and find people um

1084
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,280
from your own teams but I think just in

1085
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,610
general look outside of who is right

1086
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,050
next to you or who's across the street

1087
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,730
from you because I know my next-door

1088
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,660
neighbor doesn't want to talk about

1089
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,940
watchdog timers but I want to talk about

1090
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,440
watchdog timers and so I'm always

1091
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,150
looking for someone I'll be out back

1092
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,220
after this if your watchdog timer

1093
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,700
aficionado so let's talk about the the

1094
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,800
threats the the the things we have to

1095
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,120
watch out for moving forward into the

1096
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:54,110
future let me just go back if you show

1097
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:57,950
someone this and then you say you should

1098
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:01,520
try build your own electronics - oh boy

1099
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,680
this is not that hard

1100
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,340
that is not easy and so when Arduino

1101
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,170
came out and we're like you can blink an

1102
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,970
LED and someone looks at a blinking LED

1103
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,740
and says I can do that and even if

1104
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,470
they've never you know touched a c-plus

1105
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,760
bus before like they can figure out how

1106
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,920
to do it if you say you could put a risk

1107
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,050
five core on your Gameboy shaped badge

1108
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:21,960
and

1109
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,700
you can make that work that is a much

1110
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,849
bigger hill to climb and so we need to

1111
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:29,099
be very careful that we're not making a

1112
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:32,130
may magic and amazing things look like

1113
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,839
that's the only thing you can do and

1114
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,250
this goes back to my earlier comment and

1115
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,810
social media and always seeing finished

1116
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,660
projects like celebrate people blinking

1117
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,490
an LED celebrate people writing their

1118
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,410
first line of code make sure we're

1119
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,359
telling that story that you can get into

1120
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,280
it and that things like this hack of a

1121
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,849
badge are easy in the way that a lot of

1122
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:53,310
people before us have proved every step

1123
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,230
along the way and what we can do is go

1124
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,510
and gather all that stuff up but it

1125
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,250
doesn't have to be that big of a thing

1126
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,010
for you the first time out of the gate I

1127
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,320
think we really need to normalize the

1128
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,510
the fact that this can be entertainment

1129
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,060
you don't have to do this like oh are

1130
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,349
you doing this in order to get into

1131
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:11,760
college are you doing this to get

1132
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,770
funding for your startup it doesn't have

1133
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,000
to be I'm doing this because I don't

1134
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,830
want to watch the horrible talent show

1135
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,530
at 7 p.m. on broadcast television right

1136
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,910
like I'm getting to the point where I

1137
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,500
can't watch the TV anymore because it

1138
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,300
doesn't entertain me and so I think a

1139
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,339
lot of people argued at that point too

1140
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:27,930
and so let's tell the story that you can

1141
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,150
entertain yourself learns maybe learn

1142
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,280
something the same time but have some

1143
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,300
fun and don't put the pressure on

1144
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,040
yourself that I have to achieve all

1145
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,460
those shiny pictures on Twitter or even

1146
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,990
finish the project like just playing

1147
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,790
with it and figuring out is it the thing

1148
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,130
for me is worth it it's worth your time

1149
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:47,280
and I've said this before and I'm happy

1150
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,190
to say it again as we level up in skills

1151
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,900
and as we learn things and get better at

1152
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,700
things we have a higher and higher

1153
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,830
obligation to pass that on and to share

1154
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,119
that with other people and make sure

1155
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,740
that people feel like they're being

1156
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,960
welcomed and that their each small

1157
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,540
achievement is being celebrated so be

1158
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,950
inclusive with your knowledge pass your

1159
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,050
knowledge on publish it openly and make

1160
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,430
it something that everyone can benefit

1161
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,619
from I think that's what hackaday is all

1162
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:12,540
about and that hasn't changed over the

1163
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,970
15 years except for it's become easier

1164
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,740
to share those things it's become easier

1165
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,420
to get people excited about it it's

1166
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,920
become easier for each and every one of

1167
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,470

1168
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,869

1169

1170
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,300
