1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,600
yeah so this is debugging electronics

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,150
you can't handle the ground truth my

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,919
name is Daniel my handle is tense future

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,860
with the three so disclaimer these are

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,780
my own opinions and I'm not endorsed by

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,130
any manufacturer or supplier I'm gonna

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,670
be talking about some gear and it's

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,320
usually just stuff that I've used over

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,660
the years and has worked for me but

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,660
nobody's really paying me to say this

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,119
so who am i I've got ten years of

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,160
engineering experience I spent four

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,640
years at startups and then the last six

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,829
years have been basically building other

15
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,079
startups so I do product design and

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,870
engineering and you know process design

17
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,079
business design market research stuff

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,940
like that for a company called motivo

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,180
engineering so the last three years I've

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,480
been a senior engineer and now a manager

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,239
for the electrical and software teams so

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,000
I've spent a little bit of time

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,670
mentoring engineers and so this talk is

24
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,420
really prompted by seeing less

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,280
experienced engineers and the pitfalls

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,150
that they usually hit and yeah I'll talk

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,760
about more more about that later the

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,680
commonality between all the places I've

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,450
worked is that we're always on a tight

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,950
budget so it's like there's a sweet spot

31
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,150
of useful hardware at decent prices

32
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,549
before you get the thousands of dollars

33
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,100
equipment that's not gonna offer you as

34
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,939
much value over my career I've probably

35
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,560
worked on between fifty and a hundred

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,240
PCB designs so I've debugged a lot

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,320
caveat here's that I've got no

38
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,060
experience giving talks so this might be

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,460
a train wreck let's see that's my

40
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,259
twitter and you can check out my

41
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,030
soundcloud I do work on music a little

42
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,070
bit here and there

43
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,750
you may recognize me from one of the

44
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,750
hackaday badge life documentaries I

45
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,390
think was last year year before and Sean

46
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,280
and I who's in the front over here we

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,960
made the maneki-neko badge and it was a

48
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,960
little cute badge with some cool artwork

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,060
we got another friend to do and it had a

50
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,469
little servo on it that waved its paw

51
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,770
and blinked its eyes we like to few

52
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,940
people did to who am you you are an

53
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,470
entry level person excited

54
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,850
tinkering with electronics you could be

55
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,110
a new engineer you could be just an

56
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,510
enthusiast and I'm mainly gonna be

57
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,560
focusing on you folks a lot of

58
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,490
intermediate and experienced people get

59
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,720
something out of this too because you

60
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,970
probably forgot a lot of the strategies

61
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,200
if you haven't debugged something in a

62
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,910
while

63
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,040
so what is this I got to go fast

64
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,570
I've got like 60 slides to get through

65
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,090
so this is gonna be very much learning

66
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,460
by firehose I'm gonna be around the

67
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,070
whole rest of the of the day for the con

68
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,180
so come and grab me if you have

69
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,430
questions about something if you see me

70
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,290
wandering around in the back grab me to

71
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,060
help you debug something I'm happy to

72
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,170
help all right how do you debug you get

73
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,280
someone else to do it it's hard it sucks

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,640
thank you for coming to my TED talk just

75
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,780
kidding so why why debug well it's a

76
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,310
necessary evil if you're working on cool

77
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,020
stuff if you're working on challenging

78
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,270
stuff you're gonna make mistakes and so

79
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,700
you need to debug in my opinion the

80
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,990
electrical systems are the hardest to

81
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,270
debug you can't see the electrons you

82
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,180
have to measure them indirectly software

83
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,280
it's easy all the talk all the data is

84
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,750
in one place you just use the right tool

85
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,700
and you can see the data mechanical is

86
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,770
easy you can like feel it and see it and

87
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,470
hear it and smell it and taste it maybe

88
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,690
some combination of those climate

89
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,430
systems a little bit harder maybe I

90
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,390
don't know we haven't figured that one

91
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,260
out and so an electrical basically the

92
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,430
way you do this you have to measure some

93
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,590
some physical property and directly so

94
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,060
that means you need the right tools so

95
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,790
what does this talk for nobody really

96
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,170
teaches debugging the the engineers who

97
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,070
go through school and get their degree

98
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,320
the the experience they have is usually

99
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,269
out of necessity it's like you're doing

100
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,989
a lab or you're doing a project and you

101
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,120
got to make it work and so you start

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,989
testing things almost an art so much of

103
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:08,610
good debugging just comes from doing it

104
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,090
a lot so keep building things and you'll

105
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,959
gain an intuition for how to do it the

106
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,209
Internet is magic and when I say magic

107
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,950
is entertaining but it doesn't do

108
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,770
anything for you you can't copy paste

109
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,660
from Stack Exchange it's not gonna fix

110
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,450
your problem so the power of Google is

111
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,520
limited but sometimes useful so for

112
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,919
specific problems like something with a

113
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,600
specific device that people have run

114
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,789
into left and right you might be able to

115
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,770
find a forum thread or something like

116
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,440
that where people have found a fix most

117
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,450
of the time you're gonna have to read

118
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,789
those stories and gather clues and

119
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:46,620
really internalize how people have

120
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,500
solved problems and then you know absorb

121
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,520
those and treat them like they were

122
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,169
yours and like eventually you'll build

123
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:55,050
up this toolkit or of strategies for

124
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,990
yourself that you can use on your own

125
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,440
projects every problems a unique little

126
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,120
snowflake so I could tell you up here

127
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,280
like Oh on certain type of circuit you

128
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,950
should try this in that well how many

129
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,479
different circuits are there right it's

130
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,000
like infinite permutations of them so

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,090
really the best thing to do is

132
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,340
strategies understand how to use the

133
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,669
right tools and you'll be able to string

134
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:22,110
together measurements and string

135
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,520
together things to test to to come to

136
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,090
your your right answer or your solution

137
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,500
yeah so most strategies just means using

138
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,220
the right tool at the right time like I

139
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,289
said before this talk will be for the

140
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:39,150
beginner mostly but intermediate

141
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,220
intermediate and expert level debuggers

142
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,440
should actually also gain something out

143
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,979
of this beginner intermediate and expert

144
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,070
really correlates to simple to extremely

145
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,140
complex or difficult problems and

146
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,390
usually that means more expensive tools

147
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,729
for the like really crazy stuff if

148
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:59,220
you're doing anything in RF or other

149
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,690
high frequency stuff you're gonna need

150
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,810
you know tools that that can actually

151
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,320
measure those types of things all right

152
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,010
so what are the actual steps general

153
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,950
principle get to ground truth as quickly

154
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,250
as possible you don't want to just keep

155
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,660
trying something over and over and

156
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,390
iterating small things and seeing if it

157
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,400
works the next time like don't change a

158
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,870
variable in your code recompile the

159
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,070
whole thing and try it again it's not

160
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,910
gonna work that way

161
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,389
or at least not as quickly for me the

162
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,580
thing I recommend to most of the people

163
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,910
on my team is just measure it like

164
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,710
measure it as closely as you can

165
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,710
or as accurately as you can and keep

166
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,930
notes if you are in a multi-day debug

167
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,800
extravaganza you will forget what you

168
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,720
did the previous day or the previous

169
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,870
hour even alright so what are the real

170
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,440
steps prerequisite assume nothing check

171
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,050
all your stuff first reproduce and

172
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,810
isolate the problem second measure stuff

173
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,970
that's around that problem three add

174
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,880
people like get more ideas into the

175
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,000
problem and then profit so how do I

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,150
assume nothing check your equipment so

177
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,039
the easy stuff is like power supplies

178
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,630
are they putting out the right voltage

179
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,520
are they current limiting check the

180
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,259
noise on them I would not trust like

181
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,880
cheap bench supplies they put out a ton

182
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,259
of noise and they can affect your

183
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,330
circuit and very crazy in unexpected

184
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,710
ways

185
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,539
checking your multimeter so that's

186
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,550
another common thing everybody's gonna

187
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,229
have on the bench it's hard to like

188
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:35,970
check it you have to send it in and get

189
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,860
a calibrate and that's very expensive so

190
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,210
the cheap way to do that is get another

191
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,039
multimeter and check them against each

192
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,340
other see if they see if they agree on

193
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,860
what you're measuring check your

194
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,990
oscilloscope there are test outputs on

195
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,789
most oscilloscopes that'll give you a

196
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:57,150
little 5 volt square wave and that lets

197
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,620
you check probes to like are you probes

198
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,190
working correctly and then check obvious

199
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,960
things about the power source re the

200
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,909
device you're debugging so power supply

201
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:07,169
is it outputting the correct stuff

202
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:08,669
temperatures are nominal is there

203
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:10,500
anything heating up that's actually one

204
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,820
of my favorite things to look at first

205
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,289
is like is there part of my circuit

206
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:15,630
that's heating up too quickly or is it

207
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,250
heating up to a point that like I wasn't

208
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,909
expecting most stuff should run cool and

209
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:24,229
if it's not then you've got a problem

210
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:27,090
there's stuff like the processor clock

211
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,919
oscillation source like so the crystal

212
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,190
or the RC oscillator

213
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,589
that's an oscilloscope measure

214
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:37,049
over/under shoot on data signals so I've

215
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,809
seen sort of badly coupled or data

216
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,458
signals going between chips where

217
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,749
there's a huge like spike up each edge

218
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:46,800
what does that mean that's there's

219
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,079
problems with your circuit and that

220
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:51,360
could be affecting the device on the

221
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,879
receiving or the sending side causing

222
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,850
all sorts of weird software issues and

223
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,439
then checking that your data package

224
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:00,240
structure is correct so like is the data

225
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
format coming out like you would expect

226
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,529
so we'll go over the test equipment that

227
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:05,970
actually checks these types of things in

228
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,059
a bit so the real step one reproduce and

229
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:10,949
isolate the problem if a bug happens

230
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:14,029
once it is not a bug it is cosmic rays

231
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:16,949
and if you can't find it you can't fix

232
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:19,439
it and is it really broken or did your

233
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:24,389
finger just touch something yeah this

234
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:26,249
one's gonna be difficult to sort of

235
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:27,629
generalize because it's gonna depend on

236
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:29,670
your circuit obvious stuff is like

237
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,699
toggling the power on and off the one I

238
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:35,100
like is for microcontroller type of

239
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,139
stuff writing test code that just like

240
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:39,569
isolates the the part of your code

241
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:41,939
that's causing issues what that lets you

242
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:45,240
do is measure it on your test equipment

243
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,730
faster or more often and sort of try and

244
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,819
see some patterns or gain insights about

245
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:56,490
like probability you've gotta isolate

246
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,319
the problem start removing parts of the

247
00:09:58,319 --> 00:09:59,670
system until the problem goes away

248
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,670
so each circuit board has you know

249
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,559
multiple subsystems this one does video

250
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,449
this one's the micro this is power

251
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:08,399
supply this is your analog front-end

252
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,470
start pulling things out and pumping

253
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,750
test signals as much as you can see to

254
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,750
try and isolate where the problem is and

255
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,639
then start adding things back in until

256
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,709
until you get the desired effect the

257
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:20,879
main thing here is don't fight multiple

258
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,040
problems at once across coupling of

259
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,379
issues is really gonna hurt you in time

260
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,839
time spent figuring out what the what

261
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,579
part of your your design is going re so

262
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:34,490
there that sub circuit and measure

263
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,959
seriously just pull out your D mmm pull

264
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,579
out your oscilloscope and keep good

265
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,879
notes on what you find so touched on

266
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,029
this before for the beginners voltage D

267
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:46,830
mmm digital multi

268
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,950
voltage over time oscilloscope current

269
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,589
under 10 amps DMM I would actually limit

270
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:54,180
that to like seven or eight amps a lot

271
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,950
of DMMs will start on fire by the way

272
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,529
I've done that so try and keep it low

273
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:02,760
current current over ten amps or over

274
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,120
time so current clamp you can or current

275
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,920
probe you can actually just clamp on to

276
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,890
the the wire and hook it up to an

277
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,930
oscilloscope and see what the trace

278
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,790
looks like gray house key coils are kind

279
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,350
of cool they've moved really really fast

280
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,899
so if you're measuring fast AC signals

281
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,089
that's the right tool to use for

282
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:23,339
temperature some kind of thermal sensor

283
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:24,540
we'll talk about the different kinds in

284
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,579
a bit and for data you want a logic

285
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,829
analyzer or side channel data port so

286
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:30,870
I'll talk about what side channel means

287
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,399
in a minute how to add brains so I go

288
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,339
through an escalation series at the

289
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:39,779
individual level

290
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,399
I am reproducing the problem taking

291
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,860
notes googling stuff checking data

292
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,310
sheets app notes errata stuff like that

293
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,589
if I'm totally boggled in like my brains

294
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,120
fried and I can't figure it out bring in

295
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,829
one other person hopefully like the most

296
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,459
expert person you know show it to them

297
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,890
let them ask questions explain what

298
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,050
you've tried but be open to like ideas

299
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,940
that contradict what you think you've

300
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,410
tried and then if that doesn't work

301
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,390
bring in more people so more brains

302
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,829
equals more power but only if you keep

303
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:16,020
good notes so keeping good notes

304
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,000
don't keep stuff in your brain you will

305
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,190
forget stuff you did an hour ago

306
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,570
write it down the the reason I like the

307
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,670
strategy is it kind of like gets my

308
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,740
brain thinking about the patterns that

309
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,390
show up so if you've been debugging

310
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,949
something for multiple hours or multiple

311
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:35,220
days you you have recency bias and

312
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,300
you're only gonna be thinking about the

313
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,949
results that you got in the last few

314
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:40,770
tests if you go through maybe the next

315
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,600
day after you're refreshed and you read

316
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,339
through the like chronology of your

317
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:45,870
notes you're gonna be like oh like

318
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,519
there's a pattern that is occurring here

319
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,620
and I can narrow it down a little bit

320
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,769
better so where do you find some brains

321
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:55,079
sometimes that brain is a duck

322
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,760
there's a concept called rubber ducking

323
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,370
that is used in the software industry

324
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,980
we're basically give it an inanimate

325
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,350
object and you explained your problem to

326
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,959
that object and by verbalizing it it

327
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,459
actually gets your brain to like think

328
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,970
in a different way often and it'll pop

329
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,430
into your head I actually have a really

330
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,380
hard time doing this so I just like have

331
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,779
someone like even non-technical

332
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,699
and I explain it to them so that there's

333
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,490
like eye movement and stuff surprisingly

334
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,470
it works really well

335
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,740
sometimes that brain is another person

336
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,519
look at all these people in the room

337
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,529
everybody is willing to help you debug

338
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:34,199
so go talk to people hackerspaces meetup

339
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,449
design labs conferences college

340
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:40,709
professors local professionals people on

341
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:42,959
Twitter you know reddit

342
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,759
sometimes that person's future you don't

343
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,699
underestimate the power of like a

344
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:50,130
20-minute nap or a quick break or

345
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,490
something like that and yet again if you

346
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,319
if you can find the people with most

347
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:57,899
expertise so let's talk about tools for

348
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,680
a little bit what equipment do i buy so

349
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,350
you can buy a multimeter for ten dollars

350
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,370
you can buy a multimeter for $1,000 does

351
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,779
that mean the thousand dollar one is

352
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,610
worth it well I'm gonna tell you that

353
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,720
there's a best bang for your buck

354
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,389
there's a sweet spot right in the middle

355
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:18,720
for most for most devices start with

356
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,940
stuff that you're gonna do most often so

357
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,139
if you don't have any equipment you're

358
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,670
gonna start with something to measure

359
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,139
voltage something measure current

360
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,269
something measure temperature and maybe

361
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,220
something to measure simple data streams

362
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,920
talk about those so the first thing

363
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,829
digital multimeter slowly reacting

364
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:37,980
voltage so like power supplies is you'll

365
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,029
use this to measure so the the weaksauce

366
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,720
stuff gets something cheap on Amazon

367
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,339
again you can buy multiples and sort of

368
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,260
check them against each other you can

369
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,170
get DMMs for crazy cheap I wouldn't

370
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,060
trust any of the cheap stuff to anything

371
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,920
but volts and ohms not even current

372
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,149
unless you're measuring really small

373
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:58,829
currents their current measurement

374
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:00,540
circuits are typically pretty trashed

375
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,689
right in the middle slot there's a B&K

376
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:06,000
precision in extech I've used their

377
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,130
stuff quite a bit I use a B&K precision

378
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,630
at home

379
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,029
and it cost me like 70 80 bucks that

380
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,430
step up like I'll have that that meter

381
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,459
forever right that step up really helps

382
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:20,220
and then in the high-end fluke tends to

383
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,649
be like the de facto standard for

384
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:24,810
professional use you can get those from

385
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,079
between 150 to 500 look for used they

386
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,730
tend to hold their calibration really

387
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,029
well over time here's all the things

388
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:34,410
that you're looking at for a multimeter

389
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,720
so like I said amps micro amps frequency

390
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,300
is helpful sometimes measuring diodes

391
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,540
help sometimes like to see if a diode

392
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,019
popped or something and then let's see

393
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,300
DC volts AC volts

394
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,810
ghost detection really important

395
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,360
oscilloscope or just scope user older so

396
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,250
you can go to your second-hand shops for

397
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,339
electronics and find like nice beefy 80s

398
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,009
HP or Agilent equipment and it's gonna

399
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:08,610
last through the apocalypse harder to

400
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,319
find though and actually you're not

401
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:11,730
guaranteed that it's like working and

402
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,430
good so have them demonstrate it for you

403
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,589
this there's a recent trend in USB scope

404
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:19,350
so it's like the whole visualization

405
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,180
thing lives on software on your computer

406
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,310
and you plug it in and you can get like

407
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,709
lots of nice functionality Pico scope

408
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:27,540
has some I've used them they're like a

409
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,589
hundred ish bucks

410
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:30,630
or higher and you get a lot of like

411
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,540
features for the money next I would

412
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,310
recommend actually Rygel there's also

413
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,769
one had some bad experience with them

414
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:39,089
and past but like they make some decent

415
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:42,199
stuff in terms of specs the Rygel stuff

416
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,250
you know hackaday is written a lot of

417
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,370
articles about them because there's nice

418
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,649
unlocks let's say the high end you're

419
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:51,750
talking about Tektronix or keysight's

420
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,259
but those really start at like 8 9 or a

421
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,410
thousand bucks and up again they're

422
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,350
gonna be like the thing to rely on but

423
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,909
it's crazy expensive so yeah the main

424
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:08,819
thing you're looking for is like voltage

425
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,640
and time and like a nice trigger setup

426
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,980
so you want to be able to like catch the

427
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,510
right signal at the right time and be

428
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,079
able to zoom into now resolution

429
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,069
understanding that is out of this scope

430
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,170
but look for the highest resolution you

431
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,599
can afford effectively sometimes they

432
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,000
have all kinds of goodies in like sub

433
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,770
menus where they can do math like two

434
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,310
signals subtract from each other or

435
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,600
counting frequency or looking for rise

436
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,540
time things like that get one with a

437
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,330
candy dispenser if you can so thermal

438
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,720
sensor how do you tell if this is my

439
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,830
favorite one how do you how do you tell

440
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,600
if something's going wrong like feel it

441
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,420
like is it is it overheating that

442
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,040
probably shouldn't like put your finger

443
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,620
on it was free well not totally free the

444
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,930
next thing I use a lot is an infrared

445
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,610
thermal gun so there are these little

446
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,960
guns you get from Home Depot they're

447
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,360
like 15 bucks they like shoot a little

448
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,940
laser and like you measure the IR

449
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,380
reflectivity they're better for big

450
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,730
things are gonna be really hard for like

451
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,800
circuit board level stuff for big stuff

452
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,080
you can get the temperature pretty

453
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,180
pretty readily the ones I like are like

454
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,260
FLIR and seek and fluke makes a couple

455
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,760
ones I think they're using clear modules

456
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,460
and it's basically like a thermal camera

457
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,860
right and and you plug it into your

458
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,710
phone and your phone is the display part

459
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,930
and they're pretty decent I'll show you

460
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,220
what a picture of that looks like and

461
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,540
how it can help oh man and then there's

462
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,920
the standalone so you can get them for

463
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,110
roughly 500 bucks they're not great at

464
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,960
that level but yeah these all-in-one

465
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,880
packages like have the same kind of

466
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,110
features and they're a lot more

467
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,200
expensive but yeah the sweet spots right

468
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,730
in the middle there the little plug in

469
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,010
things for your phone so this is what

470
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,240
I'm talking about when like the type of

471
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,670
output image you would get so I don't

472
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,070
know let's look at the bottom or middle

473
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,500
right there there's a chip that's you

474
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,290
know 48 degrees that sound rides that

475
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,880
supposed to be heating up that much I

476
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,350
don't know how fast does it heat up like

477
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,060
watch the video streaming if it's going

478
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,520
from like room temp to 48 in a second

479
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,590
you popped something time to replace

480
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,030
that chip so on the left there there's

481
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,880
the

482
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,480
little $10 gun from Home Depot in the

483
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,070
middle it's the plug-in modules from

484
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,320
FLIR and on the right actually have this

485
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,180
model at work and it's like glorious to

486
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,750
use from fluke and it like records video

487
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,090
and audio and like you can all sorts of

488
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,890
settings current sensors so DMMs low

489
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:39,970
refresh rate so you're not going to

490
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,470
catch spikes or anything you're gonna

491
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,760
catch like DC level current but you got

492
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,670
a DMM already and so use it in the

493
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,850
middle sweet spot there's current clamps

494
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,830
between 20 and 100 50 bucks for actually

495
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,730
like nice ones at 150 and those have

496
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,260
functions like min max so you'll be able

497
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,510
to like actually catch spikes but it's

498
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,030
just a simple readout and then there's

499
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,410
current probes so that's just like

500
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,210
basically an oscilloscope probe that

501
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,550
measures current there's Rogowski coils

502
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,660
which are like pretty fancy and it will

503
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,280
measure like really high frequency

504
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,250
current current measurements so if

505
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,690
you're measuring like a switching power

506
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,860
supply or something so they all operate

507
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,560
on similar things the the interaction

508
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,730
between electrical and magnetic waves or

509
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,300
fields the current clamp like this fluke

510
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,970
one is super nice and it's like a

511
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,200
hundred fifty bucks you don't have to

512
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,540
spend that and get something decent

513
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,390
there's current probes and there's the

514
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,130
Rudovsky coils they all they all work

515
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,360
the same you run the wire through them

516
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,880
not multiple wires like not opposite

517
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,140
currents just the one that's carrying

518
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,030
the current you care about through

519
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,160
through a loop and it'll measure the

520
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,780
current for you so logic analyzers these

521
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,210
are if you're measuring data streams so

522
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,740
is your data stream actually coming out

523
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,680
of the chip like you software is written

524
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,840
or is there another function before it

525
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,400
leaves the chip that's modifying it and

526
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,140
like in ways that you wouldn't expect

527
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,560
check your scope some scopes have simple

528
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,650
logic analyzers built into them and so

529
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,350
then you don't spend anything I've seen

530
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,200
these like software compatible clones so

531
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,980
they like use the the expensive product

532
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,650
software but they're actually like cheap

533
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,650
knockoffs that you get on

534
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,000
and stuff I've never used them though

535
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,220
but they look pretty intriguing and then

536
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,110
don't underestimate like a scope and pen

537
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,400
and paper I can't tell you how many

538
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,460
times I've debugged like Ken busts

539
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,220
traces on a on a car just by like

540
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,600
writing it on a whiteboard totally works

541
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,830
in the middle it gets a little bit

542
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,420
expensive there are some options out

543
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,740
there that I'm not totally familiar with

544
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,720
but sits out gosh Sally Sally Sally

545
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,460
has stuff for between four hundred

546
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,550
thousand bucks it's it's really really

547
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,870
nice stuff I'll show you their software

548
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,870
in a minute I think you get best bang

549
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,250
for your buck there there's also comers

550
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,720
like didn't I can remember the product

551
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,580
they make but it's a little less

552
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,770
expensive I think it's like 100 to 200

553
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,900
dollars and at the top and you get

554
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,940
really expensive with keysight in second

555
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,540
Tektronix at the thousands so what is a

556
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,190
logic analyzer it's basically a scope

557
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,100
all the inputs are digital and it has a

558
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,650
ton of channels so between 8 & 7

559
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,590
bazillion and the the software that

560
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,500
comes with it is meant to like group

561
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,350
those bits into bytes and convert them

562
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,270
into the protocol that your speak you're

563
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,950
trying to speak and like give you some

564
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,830
words you know towards the top that that

565
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,100
makes sense for the protocol okay so

566
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,450
other stuff I'm going to breach through

567
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,800
these really quickly if you get into the

568
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:55,120
advanced areas the this stuff is like

569
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,730
mmm anyway for specific types of

570
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,290
applications so if you're trying to

571
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,760
measure resistance under one ohm for

572
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,070
instance you have a really thick power

573
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,190
cable and you need to see like how much

574
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,600
are you how much of voltage are you

575
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,040
losing in that power cable there's think

576
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,010
that's thing called a micro ohm meter

577
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,270
it's like a multimeter except it's like

578
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,910
usually in a box and it specifically

579
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,860
measures things under 1 ohm really

580
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,470
accurately usually two like three

581
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:25,040
sometimes five six decimal places

582
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,480
checking your design for high voltage

583
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,130
safety so if you work in I think high

584
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,920
voltage you want an insulation meter or

585
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,470
a high pot tester sometimes it's both in

586
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,200
one device checking for sensitive and or

587
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,500
high voltage circuits isolation probes

588
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,060
so basically this is a

589
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,300
probe with a circuit in it that like

590
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,830
that makes it super high impedance and

591
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,120
it doesn't affect the thing that you're

592
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,250
trying to measure and actually I talked

593
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,720
about a little bit later to measuring

594
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,970
high voltage circuits as well a

595
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,880
battery-powered scope is nice because it

596
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,090
doesn't let you like short and blow

597
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,430
stuff up

598
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,720
let's see objecting signals without

599
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,490
having the right code so if you're just

600
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,620
trying to pump in a pedo PWM signal

601
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,570
somewhere function generator those tend

602
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,070
to be a little bit expensive but there's

603
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,710
some DIY options out there measuring

604
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,270
analog or digital signals over long

605
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,770
periods of data loggers so if you're

606
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,870
measuring like mm battery discharge

607
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,330
curves you're gonna it's gonna take days

608
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,710
or whatever and so you're gonna want to

609
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,690
put something that can measure maybe

610
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,970
every second for a few days

611
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,980
rotational speed teka meter and those

612
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,960
can get be fairly cheap it like an auto

613
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,360
parts store measuring light intensity

614
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,450
also fairly cheap called a Lux meter or

615
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,490
a light meter on Amazon they're like 25

616
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:40,790
bucks

617
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,590
measuring specific characteristics of

618
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,840
power delivery this gets into like power

619
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,600
supply design it's called a power

620
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,310
analyzer it'll tell you more than just

621
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,870
voltage and current they'll tell you

622
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,200
some crazy stuff about the power signal

623
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,110
going through it and then measuring in

624
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,060
tens across frequency spectrum analyzer

625
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,800
it gives you a nice little plot of like

626
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,090
how your antenna is reacting to a to a

627
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,540
signal checking continuity of lots of

628
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,110
conductors cable testers usually its

629
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,280
manufacturers are using this to like

630
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,050
plug in both sides and test that they

631
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,690
didn't break anything but for DIY your

632
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,330
your DMM is gonna be enough to it's

633
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,080
called the beep test or continuity test

634
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,680
communicating with standard

635
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,120
microcontroller protocols there's the

636
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,420
bus pirate the best pirate I think I

637
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,950
wrote that on a previous slide did I

638
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,080
know I didn't so I would have put it in

639
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,130
the middle here or here the thing about

640
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,100
the best part is that it'll work only

641
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,690
when your signals are properly formatted

642
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,280
so otherwise gotta pull out of scope and

643
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,720
really count those bits and see if it's

644
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,120
coming out right communicating via a

645
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,920
serial to a microcontroller everybody

646
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,960
knows about the little like USB to UART

647
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,120
cables

648
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,070
those can be had for really cheap and

649
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,080
then testing power sources electronic

650
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,070
load so these things look kind of like

651
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,929
power supplies except that their sinks

652
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,669
so you can do like constant voltage

653
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:06,830
constant current constant power constant

654
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,019
resistance I'm sure there's others out

655
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,779
there anybody got one that they like

656
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:14,029
Finch it's a pretty pretty big bench if

657
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:15,980
you got all those tools for your own

658
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,960
designs more test points test points

659
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,679
freaking everywhere there's two kinds

660
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,269
that I like there's these clip kinds you

661
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:25,610
can get your scope probes on they're

662
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,379
easy and then there's these sort of

663
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,179
pokey kinds just a little pad they don't

664
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:30,230
take up a lot of room on your circuit

665
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,470
board test early do bench tests I don't

666
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,470
do PCBs right away I get demo boards and

667
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,820
link them all together for the

668
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,970
functionality I need I'll see you cereal

669
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,740
side channel so it's if you've got an

670
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,019
extra you are on the board break out

671
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:48,019
those pins and like spit debug data out

672
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:49,549
of them constantly and you'll get some

673
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:53,299
good insight there ways to break

674
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:54,590
sub-circuits apart so I talked about

675
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,200
isolating circuits every power supply

676
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,509
design has like a fuse or a zero ohm

677
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:01,039
resistor that I remove and see if it's

678
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,369
doing the right thing you need to gain

679
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:05,779
buffer amplifiers so if you have an

680
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:07,580
analog circuit and you have an extra op

681
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,799
amp somewhere like tie it to something

682
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,080
or don't put test points and solder

683
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,789
wires later and like LEDs everywhere

684
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:21,200
more of them all of the time all right

685
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,429
lecture mechanical stuff I got to go

686
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:25,639
quick through this so basically an

687
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:27,440
electromechanical system is a fancy way

688
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,940
of saying the system probably has a

689
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,429
motor you debug with your senses that's

690
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:33,529
a nice thing your eyeballs

691
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:36,590
or or a camera of some sort

692
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,619
cheap endoscopes on Amazon things that

693
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:42,470
you're watching for are like circular

694
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,149
things that are out and around and like

695
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:46,850
oscillating or you can also measure

696
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,190
current so it's a certain part of the

697
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,690
cycle if you go high current then you've

698
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,869
probably got like something binding up

699
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:56,570
use your ear balls mechanics stethoscope

700
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,129
is 10 bucks and it'll get you to like

701
00:27:58,129 --> 00:27:59,509
really isolate where that squeak is

702
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:04,040
happening use your fingers they are free

703
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,740
the other thing is I've done something

704
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,110
with like an IMU and Arduino to make

705
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,040
like a little like vibration sensor

706
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,110
basically like read the vibrations dump

707
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,910
them out to Excel and then create a bode

708
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,799
plot and it tells you like where that

709
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,500
frequency is especially if you're having

710
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,809
that's the bad frequency and it can tell

711
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,970
you something about like okay so it's at

712
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,290
that frequency is that because I'm

713
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,850
rotating at a certain speed

714
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,910
is that a bad speed to be rotating at

715
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,200
smellivision

716
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,890
just kidding these are done lick it's

717
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:42,110
good systems taste like umami seeing

718
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,540
dead people some people have that sense

719
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,940
that's a good one to use

720
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,830
so debugging for more in software this

721
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,030
could be its own talk and I'm sure it's

722
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,350
been done a zillion times

723
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,299
the big things to look for here is like

724
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:57,410
chip emulation can you does your dev

725
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,030
environment for writing code for this

726
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,919
chip like have an emulator that means

727
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:02,390
you don't have to flash as much you'll

728
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,360
have to go and measure things as much

729
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,380
getting the right programmer and

730
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,450
debugger sometimes you can buy a generic

731
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,799
or clone that works as well as the like

732
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,770
manufacturers one sometimes you can't

733
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,250
and having a debugger just in general is

734
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,419
gonna save you tons of time let's see

735
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:23,419
make unit tests so right code this is

736
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:25,100
really a software land now like right

737
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,380
pieces of code that check that you wrote

738
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,780
functions correctly basically and this

739
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,250
can be like a totally different piece of

740
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,620
software that's probably for another

741
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,040
talk and then yeah like I was talking

742
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,660
about the serial port the extra serial

743
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,950
port for debug it doesn't have to be

744
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,510
output only it can be input as well you

745
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,610
can inject variables into your program

746
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,910
with a with a debug port on the outside

747
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,380
write a script for it and you got a

748
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,510
fancy like like hardware in the loop

749
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:54,860
unit tester when not to debug if you

750
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,929
have lots of Units they were inexpensive

751
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,669
and only one of them is freaking out

752
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:00,590
don't waste your time move on and get

753
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,270
back to it later if that thing is worth

754
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,929
your time well that being said can be a

755
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,250
great learning experience if you do have

756
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,669
the time okay so conclusions I just

757
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:12,850
wanted to like put gifts on slide

758
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,400
and then share some of my knowledge with

759
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,960
all of you debugging is an art like

760
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,210
skating is an art there's a muscle

761
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,040
memory to it or like a brain muscle

762
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,780
memory just got to do it a lot and

763
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,150
you'll know the right tool and the right

764
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,360
way to use that tool later everything is

765
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,800
experienced so just keep doing it

766
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,150
utilize the people around you this

767
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,730
community is like the best for finding

768
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,740
the people who will help out debugging

769
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,020
your circuits so like I can just pull

770
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,960
somebody aside pull me aside check all

771
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,400
your assumptions be methodical use the

772
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,640
right equipment

773
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:48,160
someone quick plug we're hiring I run

774
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,110
the electrical and software teams so

775
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,810
like we work on crazy stuff at motivo

776
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,610
like I'm not joking flying cards

777
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,590
autonomous vehicles AG tech like

778
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,020
planting harvesting processing personal

779
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,240
mobility custom factory automation all

780
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,400
this crazy stuff and like I'm always

781
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,340
looking for enthusiastic people right

782
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,710
like we'll teach you a bit about how to

783
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,780
do the stuff like I want enthusiasm and

784
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:16,190
passion anyway that's all thank you

785
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,150
[Applause]
