and Alex glow hi I'm Jay as far as I've

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,810
gotten with this I'm Jay and this is my

18
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,580
companion Dexter I'm Alex and this is my

19
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,310
companion Rover Archimedes and down here

20
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,450
we got some other friends this is

21
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,940
Threepio my new telepresence robot and

22
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,340
oh yeah I have a few because I've been

23
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,750
one busy ear this is Aussie Odin son and

24
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,060
Prometheus these are my children so what

25
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,149
do you think a companion robot is

26
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,170
personally I believe a companion robot

27
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,670
is any robot you can take with you on

28
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,560
anytime from adventure if you see a

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,600
sci-fi film r2d2 rolls next to Luke

30
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,019
Skywalker Skywalker half the time or

31
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,549
wall-e he rolls next to people sometimes

32
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,380
to any type of fun robot you can take

33
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,620
with you any any avenger I think of it

34
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,150
it's kind of like a Wizards familiar

35
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,250
where like it's a creature that kind of

36
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,680
complements my personality and also like

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,720
he's kind of nice to have as a friend

38
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,940
like I can kind of do this and like

39
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,530
scratch my head with him and sometimes

40
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,060
he pokes me in the eye just like a real

41
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,250
friend but you know in general it's like

42
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,739
a kind of helpful spirit I think mines

43
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:41,040
judges me half a time I feel

44
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,990
responding to my robots very well I love

45
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,230
kids

46
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:55,680
so excited parents it's so much fun

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,959
and I've had moments rhombic like hi hi

48
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,519
where's repairing all the guys does not

49
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,180
look good but I love like going out in

50
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,560
public and just seeing everyone's

51
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,230
reactions like the difference between

52
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,549
kids reaction and adults reaction

53
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:09,930
especially in a dog who's lived in the

54
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,810
normal world it's definitely err

55
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,060
entertaining I want to say most people

56
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,530
just look at me with a weird look like

57
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,849
what the heck is that and then maybe

58
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,499
they'll say something or approach me but

59
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,969
kids are where it's at like they're just

60
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,000
like oh my god it's a robot I totally

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,639
agree I've also had really good

62
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,829
experience in oh oh no anyway yeah kids

63
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,750
are great drunk people are great I think

64
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,769
the ideal person to look at a robot

65
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,870
would be like a drunk nerdy kid but

66
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,469
hopefully that won't actually happen

67
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:44,879
fresh meat your college was like half a

68
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,590
drunken nerdy kids yeah people love them

69
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,239
and and people have to come up and like

70
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,099
try to touch them and interact with them

71
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,590
and it's kind of interesting like people

72
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,180
come at them with this sort of trust and

73
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,549
love even people who normally don't like

74
00:03:59,549 --> 00:03:59,939
robots

75
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,159
or cameras will come up and like try to

76
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,919
interact with it in really trusting way

77
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,879
which has you know implications yeah

78
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,299
guide be safe about this guy's so I'm

79
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,570
gonna go through some of my upgrades I

80
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,909
fail a lot constantly I'm failing right

81
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:23,520
now probably as far as I know but I

82
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,960
always make constant upgrades to my

83
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,940
robots I take them out with me I take

84
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,009
him to work a Sammy knows I take my herb

85
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,419
I still working like on other adventures

86
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,310
and then I just test them I like I

87
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,990
dropped them they'll like won't work and

88
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,580
I love that because as soon as I find

89
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,750
out that something's wrong with them I

90
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,789
write it down I think I can fix it like

91
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:40,710
okay this is what we have up here is

92
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,190
like ah C V 3 and V 4 V 3 was cool and

93
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,539
someone I published on hackster just

94
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:47,580
because he's small and compatible but

95
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,770
his legs kept getting stuck in that form

96
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,389
and he just wouldn't move his legs very

97
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,610
well so I focused on upgrading his legs

98
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,349
with the V 4 that's what he has longer

99
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:57,750
legs but I focus on only making two of

100
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,520
those legs move just because he kept

101
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,360
kicking me in the face

102
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,499
it's kind of funny you're having a

103
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:04,669
conversation with somebody in a robot

104
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,779
just like attention attention now so

105
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:12,439
yeah next is this little guy here who's

106
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,199
like acting up right now hi Dexter

107
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,279
anyway this is Dexter he is strange this

108
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,189
is the v1 here this was my first version

109
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,259
of them he was pretty much a baby like

110
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,519
he has a little baby legs and everything

111
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,009
and like no fingers I took him out with

112
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:29,959
me one day and he's not in half like

113
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,759
from torso to stomach just snapped in

114
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,769
half wires everywhere so I upgraded him

115
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:37,309
to dexter v2 which has much dirtier area

116
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:39,110
more screws to hold him in place I made

117
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,519
him fingers so you can actually touch

118
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:43,279
things a little bit and then recently he

119
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,779
upgraded because I hung out with all of

120
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,729
you wonderful people on Friday and then

121
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,529
I got so inspired that I forgot to sleep

122
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:50,419
and upgrade what's a v3 so this is the

123
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:56,360
second day being alive oh and here's a

124
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,919
couple of your awesome drawings of the

125
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,779
transformation as well you can kind of

126
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,819
see how you are so great at like you

127
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,469
always sketch stuff out beforehand and

128
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:06,110
stuff I just have like some some super

129
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,999
messy notes and stuff and I I think I

130
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,579
used Cadiz like my sketchbook but our

131
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,679
commedia started out as this little guy

132
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:16,789
and he's all janked me anyway uh yeah

133
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:18,709
his wing has fallen off like four times

134
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:20,029
all I've been trying to set him up for

135
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:22,369
this and a lot of the upgrades that I've

136
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:24,999
made of in terms of durability and

137
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:27,979
comfort so like you look at this and you

138
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,409
look comfortable to wear it kind of was

139
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:32,449
but it really wasn't in there long term

140
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,189
and then yesterday I was wearing this

141
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:35,659
and I had dropped him again and it like

142
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:36,979
totally shattered in broke but that's

143
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,419
great because finally I have this like

144
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:39,800
shoulder harness it's actually

145
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,439
comfortable to wear fancy that and a

146
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,419
battery management has also come a long

147
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,419
way you might not know this a lot of USB

148
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,610
batteries that you get will like turn

149
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,499
off after two minutes and then you're

150
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:53,689
like my robot stuff for no reason great

151
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,240
and if you PI that's running the brain

152
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,740
of your robot it takes two minutes to

153
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,860
boot that's not optimal hi what's what's

154
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,519
going on anyway he's he's very shy

155
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,169
sometimes as well so I think a lot of

156
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,430
comes out in terms of personality yeah

157
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,589
and then this is Threepio so part of

158
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:13,460
them

159
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,440
of what I'm trying to make is turn these

160
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,970
guys into more of telepresence robot

161
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,770
this guy started out he's got two little

162
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,660
third hands here with servos on them and

163
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,550
the idea was that he would have a little

164
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,889
camera he's got this LED ring that he

165
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,900
can turn on and he'd be able to take

166
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,810
photos for me and document my projects

167
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,240
for me so that I don't have to be like

168
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,009
juggling a camera at the same time and

169
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,370
trying to do stuff but he's evolved into

170
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,690
this idea of what if we made

171
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,389
telepresence not suck cuz it totally

172
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:43,639
does and there's these couple of

173
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,430
projects by Jill fair the last name but

174
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,759
let's robot TV and Remo dot TV which my

175
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,289
friend muhib has been playing with as

176
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,039
well and um it basically allows you to

177
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,810
stream a robot to the internet people

178
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,880
can look through its eyes and control

179
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,490
whatever actuators it has through little

180
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,199
buttons in the interface and I think

181
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,970
that's a great platform to start making

182
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,949
cooler telepresence and so I think

183
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:08,479
that's the future of our communities as

184
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,669
well as that he's gonna start being more

185
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:13,880
of you know instead of a replacement for

186
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,500
the iPad on a stick model of

187
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,120
telepresence which is not engaging for

188
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,400
anyone everyone loves these kinds of

189
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,409
things like little characters I think

190
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:31,250
it's a great place for it to go sorry

191
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,909
who actually just okay so fun thing I

192
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,020
guess they're gonna go to the future of

193
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,659
all of these personally myself I want to

194
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,120
make more robots like I have other more

195
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,490
crazier ideas I plan to go to Dragon

196
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,779
with a real flamethrower later down the

197
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,250
line I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able

198
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,930
bring out to work well I'm gonna try oh

199
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,010
no I would plan for like a two-step

200
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,300
thing where I'll be wrapped around me

201
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,440
and then his head would stick out and

202
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,670
shoot a flamethrower out and we can be

203
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,459
like haha jakar so I have that I have a

204
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,470
fairy I got an idea of thanks to having

205
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,209
new friends that I met last night so I'm

206
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:06,440
gonna build a new fairy robot that's

207
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,060
gonna be fun and working on the new Fox

208
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,470
already that Barney started sketches for

209
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,630
so I'm a workaholic I love building

210
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,310
robots I want to build more robots that

211
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,690
you can wear and take with you and to

212
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,459
have new interfaces and new systems and

213
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,800
all these new amazing things you can do

214
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,570
like Star Wars doesn't have to have all

215
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,770
the cool joy so we can make some cool

216
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,770
ones too

217
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,750
for the future also I've been wanting to

218
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,630
integrate these with chirp so data over

219
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,190
audio and it sounds like kind of like a

220
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,650
bird chirping or r2d2 noises and we want

221
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,880
to have them all be able to communicate

222
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,140
with each other and basically the only

223
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,060
thing that's holding it up is the fact

224
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,710
that I suck at software and we both

225
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,300
we're both a lot more comfortable with

226
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,110
hardware than software so but but it's

227
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,730
nearly there I've been saying this for

228
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,560
the last like year and the other thing

229
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,010
is has archimedes its parts break now

230
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,530
I'm replacing them with bits of recycled

231
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,030
plastic so that I can practice building

232
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,320
robots out of stuff that's actually

233
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,570
sustainable I've been learning how to

234
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,970
recycle PLA filament and be able to make

235
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,170
new stuff out of it and these are made

236
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,430
out of milk jugs these like

237
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,990
weird-looking feathers it looks like

238
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,960
crap right now and that's okay uh you

239
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,980
know some days I do as well

240
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,830
trust me as a person who breaks all the

241
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,360
stuff like I'm just gonna go ahead say

242
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,720
his hand fell off so have you seen Toy

243
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,000
Story have a hand woody no yeah yeah

244
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,850
so breaky things are fine but upgrades

245
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:37,630
are necessary this is us we're weird

246
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,950
we're strange would like to build things

247
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,410
please become our friends and I expect

248
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,699
