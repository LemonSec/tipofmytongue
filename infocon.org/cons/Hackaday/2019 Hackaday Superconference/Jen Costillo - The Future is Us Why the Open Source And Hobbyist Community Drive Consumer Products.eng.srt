1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
okay I'm Jane Castillo and today I want

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,640
to talk with you about how the open

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,130
source and maker hobbyist communities

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,769
are really driving high-tech innovation

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,610
in consumer products so when I wrote up

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,760
my proposal I did not originally intend

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,500
on doing a US history and economics

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,359
report but that's essentially what I had

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,609
to dive in and do I spent time

10
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,820
researching a multi-dimensional stream

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,720
of the rise of consumer electronics

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,600
culture economic recession specifically

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,480
in the u.s. open source hobbyist

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,520
electronics etc etcetera in short I have

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,190
the basis of a book that I don't know if

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,950
I really want to write but to make my

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,090
point in the limited amount of time that

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,070
we have is we only really have like 25

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,500
minutes 30 minutes I'm gonna very

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,320
coarsely skim through the 70s get more

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,360
finer grained as we get towards the post

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,760
Great Recession and then I'm gonna limit

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,350
to a very specific set of points to make

24
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,870
my case but if I'm missing something if

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,220
you have comments please talk to me

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,900
afterward so putting some context on

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,210
what it was like in the 70s moving

28
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,340
through the early 80s we had the end of

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,250
the Vietnam War the president resigns

30
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,979
there's an energy crisis the Middle East

31
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,470
was conflicting with Western interests

32
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,600
and this led to several long recessions

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,580
that in some cases happened back-to-back

34
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,890
in this decade plus there was a huge

35
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,320
cultural transformation we went from the

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,689
Leave It to Beaver times in the 60s and

37
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,400
then started to acknowledge that people

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,979
get divorced a single woman could have

39
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,689
control over her fertility and her

40
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,149
finances and we also noticed that

41
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,860
calculating was suddenly moving out of

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,780
large computers or done by paper and

43
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,570
shrinking down from first tabletop and

44
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,420
eventually to pocket calculators and so

45
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,570
people wanted those and that was very

46
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,640
novel in some ways and then by the time

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,829
you get to the early 80s people start

48
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,848
living on credit cards meanwhile

49
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,440
electronic hobbyists are becoming more

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,710
mainstream

51
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,830
there's more media magazines BBS's

52
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,810
designed to support them and by the time

53
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,730
we get to the early 80s people are less

54
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,550
inclined to buy soldering kits to put

55
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,800
together a computer or a calculator but

56
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,450
they're expecting to buy the full device

57
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,240
ready-made ready to go and the homebrew

58
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,280
Computer Club in Palo Alto their members

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,080
were leading the way by making these

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,360
huge breakthroughs that were impacting

61
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,340
the push to get computers into the home

62
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,770
so it started with gary kildall with CPM

63
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,100
which was the predecessor to ms-dos we

64
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,590
have Lee Ching Wong who made the chroma

65
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,910
Co Dazzler which is one of the first

66
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,760
commercially available video cards at

67
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,710
the time he's also responsible for the

68
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,190
most popular version of tiny basic you

69
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,950
have Jerry Lawson was the creator of the

70
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,420
first gaming cartridge system the

71
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,900
Fairchild channel F and obviously we

72
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,900
have jobs and Wozniak who were

73
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,590
responsible for the Apple one and that

74
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,360
was really their first push to get

75
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,130
anything getting a computer into the

76
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,690
home and very friendly and accessible

77
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,250
for more than just us geeks to use by

78
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,020
the time you get into the 80s we have

79
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,270
Adam as Osborne with the Osborne

80
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,930
computer and then by 84 we have the

81
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,060
first release of GCC by the time we get

82
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,160
into the 90s it's the end of the Cold

83
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,380
War we have our first Gulf War

84
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,870
there's the rise of the 24/7 news

85
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,230
networks there's only one recession at

86
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,670
this time right at the beginning and

87
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,270
that did not foretell the amount of huge

88
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,250
growth that was coming to both the

89
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,850
economy and the technology industry now

90
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,570
91 also marked the point that somebody

91
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,630
started on the first not the first a

92
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,000
critical piece of open source software

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,610
that was Linux and it took a little

94
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,080
while before a gained traction and

95
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,510
became kind of what we see it today but

96
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,330
that all started with like a message on

97
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:16,149
a list by the time you get to 93 you

98
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,649
have the public Internet and it's

99
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,480
immediately commercialized so you have

100
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,120
long-running BBS as like comp

101
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,190
serve we're quickly getting overshadowed

102
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,470
by another BBS like AOL

103
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,800
who's basically throwing lots of cd-roms

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,570
at everyone in the country to get them

105
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,190
to switch over does anyone remember

106
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,290
getting did they all end up like

107
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,010
coasters for you guys and of course they

108
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,800
got they got in your head that little

109
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,449
catchphrase you got mail you got mail

110
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,430
over and over again so they did some

111
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,320
incredible marketing so now we have the

112
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,600
internet globalization providing enough

113
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,699
reason for academics to escape to

114
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,550
Silicon Valley and the dot-com boom

115
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,729
starts during that time there's really a

116
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,160
want for us to get away from just having

117
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,380
dial-up access that's becoming like this

118
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,110
increasingly limiting factor in moving

119
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,270
to bigger and better things and so you

120
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,979
have the telecom wars starting so you

121
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,130
have ISDN and xDSL startups coming out

122
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,410
from all over the place but

123
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,060
unfortunately the prices never really

124
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,740
dropped here in the United States and

125
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,419
barrier to access still remain

126
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,139
exceedingly high meanwhile bus hobbyists

127
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,760
were finding our international

128
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,310
communities because we're using news

129
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,560
groups but we're still using local

130
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,750
companies in town to buy most of our

131
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,150
parts for our projects and we're also

132
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,669
still staying after work to use those

133
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,389
nice oscilloscopes and soldering irons

134
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,370
in most cases because that equipment

135
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,490
still was really expensive by the end of

136
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,550
the 90s we have the open-source hardware

137
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,380
spec the very first revision and it was

138
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,380
released in 1997 it didn't really make

139
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,979
much of a boom at the time okay when we

140
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,289
get to the aughts we get our first bust

141
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,199
and there were some questions around

142
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,150
what the what theses were going to do

143
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,120
for future investment in technology for

144
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,270
the consumer market there's a huge

145
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,250
impact on the development and acceptance

146
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,169
of smartphones that kind of started

147
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,750
picking up during this decade and mobile

148
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,400
applications are providing a new means

149
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,430
for delivering a software service most

150
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,380
notably social media companies are

151
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,210
really helping to drive that growth in

152
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:27,740
adoption

153
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,680
smartphones and we don't really see that

154
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,970
until like the following decade but this

155
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,020
it really starts here in this time so

156
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,830
probably the biggest thing and the

157
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,180
reason why a lot of us are in this room

158
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,150
is because this is also the decade that

159
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,460
the maker movement is born and it

160
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,380
started off with the maker magazine that

161
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,120
evolved into a series of websites and

162
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,810
books and even affair that were that

163
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,780
we're all familiar with but it also

164
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,069
brought to light

165
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:57,169
several matric makers centric companies

166
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:59,900
like Adafruit evil mad scientist lab and

167
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,800
Sparkfun so then when we get to 2005

168
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,960
that open source hardware definition

169
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,780
that kind of flopped in 97 they do a

170
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,330
revision and all those same companies

171
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,610
end up rallying around it to provide the

172
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,900
stickiness that's needed for it to

173
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,659
finally gain traction in the community

174
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:20,560
and help with that technology evolution

175
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,630
now it should be noted that the iPhone

176
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,080
is also launched right before the right

177
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,060
before the Great Recession and then one

178
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,009
thing that I was able to prove at least

179
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,360
at the time is that you can make an app

180
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,280
about anything and you can make money

181
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,360
even if it's called I fart so we're

182
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,099
getting toward getting through the Great

183
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:43,190
Recession Kickstarter opens in 2009 it

184
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,190
was originally created to fund artists

185
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,610
and their projects but I think most of

186
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,770
us know that didn't stay that way how

187
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,180
many people have done a Kickstarter

188
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,449
project yeah and how many of you guys

189
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,490
consider yourselves like strictly like

190
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,539
traditional artists a much smaller group

191
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:08,090
yeah okay so 2010 I didn't feel

192
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,159
qualified to kind of break down what the

193
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:11,810
key things that happened during this

194
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,940
period are but I do think a lot of what

195
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,550
happened during the Great Recession and

196
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,560
over those last few years should be

197
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,819
reflected upon so a lot of what happened

198
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,860
during that time period still sticks

199
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,039
with us so one of the first things we

200
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,460
start noticing one of the first things

201
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,979
we start noticing is that we have some

202
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,299
new models that are coming into effect

203
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,889
we start creating businesses for the

204
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:41,078
sake of supporting smaller fledgling

205
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:43,208
businesses because there's everyone

206
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,709
suddenly needs to have a business to

207
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,809
stay afloat because unemployment is high

208
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:49,269
we need to make money we start

209
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:54,239
developing this hustle culture and

210
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,589
around 2013 maker media's spun out it's

211
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:01,299
estimated to be a ten million dollar

212
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:04,809
company and it's currently you know

213
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:06,220
through this decade it's also bringing

214
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,049
in what over 1 million attendees

215
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:13,179
worldwide by the time you get to 2017 so

216
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:17,019
examples of industries that sprang up

217
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:19,149
because they're trying to support small

218
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:21,220
businesses that are just trying to get

219
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,309
by you have co-working offices they

220
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:25,899
start popping up everywhere and some of

221
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,109
them are even taking payment in the form

222
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:31,299
of equity in your company so if you have

223
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:33,249
a high tech startup you could basically

224
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,290
just give away a portion of your company

225
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,119
just so you can have an office space to

226
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,509
develop your product now by the year

227
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:43,689
2018 there's there's basically an

228
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:45,459
estimate of over 18,000 co-working

229
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,309
spaces available worldwide so that boom

230
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:50,470
has happened because there's this want

231
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,499
for flexibility and how you can run your

232
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:56,350
company another way that people are

233
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,059
running their companies to develop their

234
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:01,269
products is using maker spaces has

235
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,279
anyone tried operating a company out of

236
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,480
a maker space ok it's just me

237
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,720
[Laughter]

238
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,369
shockingly popular for people to just go

239
00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:14,230
to go to the office every day at the

240
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,389
makerspace because it's generally

241
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:18,489
cheaper than trying to do that at a

242
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:21,819
co-working location and even then if you

243
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,069
look at 2016 and look at the previous

244
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:27,249
decade so to any 2006 to 2016 you have a

245
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:31,209
14x growth worldwide in maker spaces and

246
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:32,980
so both of those were contributing to a

247
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,589
ways that people could be scrappy and

248
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:37,569
have what what is perceived as a

249
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:39,970
professional business running I'll be at

250
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:47,259
a much smaller a smaller way but it's

251
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,089
not enough to just like have an office

252
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:50,410
you actually have to sell stuff

253
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,140
and that's where the other big model

254
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,550
that comes in you know you may not be

255
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,830
able to sell millions of things but you

256
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,450
can smell them and sell them in small

257
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,940
quantities so that's we're at Indy

258
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,700
crowdsource and Kickstarter's start

259
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,380
really becoming a making a big impact

260
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,880
for people like us who've made like

261
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,700
little small ideas maybe not don't know

262
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,020
how to get there get them out in the

263
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,660
world and Amazon hadn't really been

264
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,450
receptive for us to basically sell a

265
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,130
bunch of stuff they hadn't quite got it

266
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,790
down yet what they expected us to do so

267
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,950
you have usually tindy for stuff that's

268
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,080
already established and then if you want

269
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,820
to launch new technology innovation you

270
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,220
go to Kickstarter so by the so using

271
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,320
these three things what you end up

272
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,630
seeing is that you know these new

273
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,730
products new tools new services are all

274
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,610
becoming used because VCS are not

275
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,850
providing us the access to funding so we

276
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,370
could have what would be perceived as a

277
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,780
normal technology or a normal startup so

278
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,640
we end up using these scrappy means to

279
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,550
basically survive during this time and

280
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,380
the reason why they're not funding us is

281
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,000
because they're holding us to start

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,930
software metrics of success and those

283
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,220
are really hard for us to do because we

284
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,070
have to carry things like inventory and

285
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,870
you know our design cycle in process is

286
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,340
what you know way more expensive so as I

287
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,160
mentioned Hardware had to be really

288
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,160
scrappy in this last decade but we end

289
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,870
up doing something that makes an even

290
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,740
bigger impact

291
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,990
so because of makers and open-source

292
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,670
we've made much more accessible

293
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,530
platforms for people to work with so

294
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,540
both professionally and at an amateur

295
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,700
level so that means things like Arduino

296
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,900
Raspberry Pi BeagleBone all of those

297
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,120
make it a lot easier for anyone to kind

298
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,860
of do an immediate quick prototype at a

299
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,180
much lower cost we've also changed from

300
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,860
having a hacker culture which is very

301
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,350
computer focused into something that's a

302
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,760
little bit more inclusive and broader

303
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,890
and that being maker one so it's moved

304
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,610
into wearables and 3d printing and it's

305
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,560
just expanded beyond just the one thing

306
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,980
in regards to tools this is probably the

307
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,720
biggest impact that we've had both for

308
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,180
ourselves and on the broader electronics

309
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:18,959
industry so we've made these tools and

310
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,600
as they've served as a chance for us to

311
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,730
enable all of our other friends to be

312
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,959
able to do stuff that they wouldn't be

313
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,100
able to do without spending a lot of

314
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,290
money but it's also enabled large

315
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,240
corporations to do what they need to do

316
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,680
at a much lower cost too

317
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,139
so that would be things like the cheaper

318
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,829
oscilloscopes cheaper debuggers sale

319
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:41,430
EA's and so on and because they have the

320
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,250
tools now you have the platforms now

321
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,750
there's a little bit more interest in us

322
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,990
costing down on the software to develop

323
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,930
the firmware or the app that we want to

324
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,990
put on this hardware and traditionally

325
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,120
that's always meant you have to put it

326
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,639
on a Windows machine but as you've seen

327
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,620
people want to use Mac's people want to

328
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,779
use Linux and so there's much more of an

329
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:09,120
impetus to develop to develop a a tool

330
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,529
chain that's gonna be able to be

331
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:12,600
portable across different platforms so

332
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,190
you don't have to pay Microsoft to have

333
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,750
to run Windows just so you can like

334
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,930
basically write a simple app the result

335
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,790
of all of these meaning the cheaper

336
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,040
tools the lower entry point because you

337
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,720
have to pay as much for the platform

338
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,769
means that it's a lot easier for you to

339
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,350
derive your professional growth outside

340
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,120
of the corporation which means you're

341
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,310
gonna have a lot more leeway in driving

342
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,110
where you want your career or where you

343
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,110
want your ideas to go but this

344
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,720
unfortunately has an unintended

345
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,069
consequence and we'll talk about that

346
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:46,219
later

347
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,590
okay so large companies are way more

348
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,660
cautious about their investments despite

349
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,980
the fact that there's a longer periods

350
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,170
of recessions if you look back at those

351
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,670
timelines that I put up there you saw

352
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,240
70s 80s more recessions by the time we

353
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,850
get to the 90s knots and so on

354
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,190
you basically have one recession every

355
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,650
decade so that's about what's happening

356
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,180
they're getting further further apart

357
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,820
but we tend to be much more worried

358
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,590
about them on a four to five year basis

359
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,740
so what's happening is companies aren't

360
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,510
investing in R&D the way that they used

361
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,120
to be doing because they're always

362
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,680
worried about these recessions and

363
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,620
overall VC funds they're also growing as

364
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,810
are the rounds for them but they're also

365
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,390
being much more picky about how they

366
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,460
invest so they're developing more

367
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,560
refined criteria for investing in

368
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,290
companies so perhaps what you've noticed

369
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,550
is series a used to be about five

370
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,950
million dollars maybe ten and you didn't

371
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,950
even have our product yet now that's

372
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,600
considered seed stage if you don't have

373
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,230
a product you're not gonna get series a

374
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,370
series a is a little bit bigger though

375
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,810
but that's basically the delineation now

376
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,610
ultimately VCS are looking for larger

377
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,710
and faster growth so they can get a

378
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,750
bigger quicker turnover and this is

379
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,520
heavily done to create a more

380
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,440
deterministic return on investment so it

381
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,260
used to be they would always say we're

382
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,450
gonna invest in 10 startups and we

383
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,180
expect one to be the big winner to make

384
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,430
up for the seven or so losers and maybe

385
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,050
the two or three zombies that kind of

386
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,430
sit there now they're looking to

387
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,400
increase it so they have two to three

388
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,230
big winners or as many as they can and

389
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,050
they feel that if they can make them get

390
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,060
a product out quicker that the more

391
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,250
heavily they're more likely to provide

392
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,200
you this return on investment and that's

393
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,270
why it's harder for us in hardware to

394
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:52,330
get that money so as I mentioned for

395
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,610
Hardware it's harder for us and that's

396
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,080
why they've been increasingly funding

397
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,270
software a lot more in fact this is the

398
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,300
2018 report and their 40 percent of

399
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,630
their deals are just software

400
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,119
Hardware depending on how you define it

401
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,970
is like 3% maybe 10% according to this

402
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,709
graph and it's been pretty consistent

403
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,569
for the last decade the way that they're

404
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,789
funding it I think biotech is like the

405
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:19,439
next biggest one yeah so so we're

406
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,449
definitely impacted and we're sure then

407
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:22,980
you can see how we've shifted how we

408
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,199
fund the way that we do our products

409
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,919
okay now the other thing is that they're

410
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,890
also not IP owing the same way so that's

411
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,150
usually where they would get the big

412
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,669
return instead now what's popular is

413
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:39,390
doing an MA

414
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,669
so mergers and acquisitions is usually

415
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,169
the way that everyone kind of gets out

416
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:50,900
and successfully ends their startup okay

417
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,220
so here's the big thing that I was that

418
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,140
I came up with looking at all the data

419
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,320
looking at what was happening

420
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,530
consistently through the decades is that

421
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,049
you'd have a recession funding would go

422
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,530
down projects would get cut because

423
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,909
everyone's kind of preparing for how

424
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:10,559
they're gonna get through the the winter

425
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,620
the recession winter and that means that

426
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,110
they're laying off engineers they're

427
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:23,280
getting rid of internal expertise and so

428
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,309
now you have some unemployed or

429
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,080
underemployed engineers or sitting

430
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,150
around doing very boring jobs so what do

431
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,710
they do they go like well I wanted to

432
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,000
work on this but you cut that project

433
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,460
let me go work on this at home maybe

434
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,780
with some other people I can figure it

435
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,590
out and that's what they're doing so

436
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,480
sometimes it's not as grandiose as like

437
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,690
you know coming up with next-generation

438
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,360
virtual reality but it's not that far

439
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,650
off from that either so some of the

440
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,890
things that that board engineers have

441
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,480
been doing because they can't do it in

442
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,870
their companies has been looking and

443
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,940
finding new market opportunities

444
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,690
finding the reasons to make cheaper

445
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,330
tools like oscilloscopes logic analyzers

446
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,770
and that's how you end up with Chi CAD

447
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,350
and MakerBot you have down market

448
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,000
electronics platforms like Arduino

449
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,040
Raspberry Pi instead of paying hundreds

450
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,480
of dollars for single board computers

451
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:15,950
that

452
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,649
would usually buy and then of course all

453
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:21,250
the free and open-source tool chains

454
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,539
most importantly what they're doing is

455
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:26,360
they're serving these underserved

456
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,549
engineers who kind of like won't have a

457
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:30,289
want for all these tools but can't seem

458
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,809
to get them and really want to bring

459
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:35,539
these new ideas that they have to life

460
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,639
so that's how you end up with also tindy

461
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:39,950
and shape ways and so on it's just all

462
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,769
creating an ecosystem of services and

463
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:45,200
products to enable people to take to

464
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,149
take the ideas that couldn't happen

465
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:49,010
because corporations kind of shut down

466
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,559
those projects and at least give them a

467
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,139
chance to make them happen so as you

468
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:55,490
were saying so they're working on all

469
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,809
these projects things are starting to

470
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,370
pick up they've made these new models

471
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,309
products etc etc new technologies and as

472
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:05,360
the recession ends corporations are like

473
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,669
oh we're behind we need we need the

474
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:10,490
new sparkly thing to sell people so they

475
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,139
start licensing buying up all these

476
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:13,580
companies and technologies that are

477
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,470
there and that's pretty much the way

478
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,059
that they're served vibrations are

479
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,440
surviving in this case they just kind of

480
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,139
buy up licensed leverage all these new

481
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:22,370
models and things that everyone's been

482
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,010
working on during recessions and then it

483
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,330
starts again so what's the corporate

484
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:34,000
impact on development well in general

485
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,320
for most consumer products it's a

486
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,580
one-year quick turnkey limited schedule

487
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,100
and quality isn't really the biggest

488
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,990
thing on their minds so if a breaks you

489
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,080
can buy the next one that's if you

490
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,970
didn't know that I'm sorry to tell you

491
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,570
that that's exactly what Amazon is doing

492
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,700
[Music]

493
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,230
and then the other thing that you notice

494
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,519
is that there's not a lot of new

495
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:01,460
technology that's in these new products

496
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,769
have you noticed things are not as

497
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:06,200
interesting lately especially on the

498
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,380
cell phones okay maybe not

499
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,269
in my opinion there's not a lot of new

500
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,860
stuff we've mostly been putting more

501
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,809
software in things maybe put like emoji

502
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:16,100
stickers or saying that's the big

503
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,380
selling point for the year not terribly

504
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,690
interesting so what companies are doing

505
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,100
is they're trying to limit as much of

506
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,679
their risk as possible in terms of

507
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:25,970
putting in new technology and so they're

508
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,640
very grudgingly putting that in

509
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,630
so that's why you see a lot of

510
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,150
diminishing returns on kind of basic

511
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,679
items as they become more commoditized

512
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,880
so they're only gonna add something new

513
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,549
if the competitor does and usually that

514
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,340
competitor is another startup or some

515
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,960
other big name that's forcing them to it

516
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,220
but in general they're avoiding at all

517
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,679
costs in the background of that they're

518
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,390
putting an immense pressure on lowering

519
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,160
their bomb costs but there's only so

520
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,600
much that you can do you know you can

521
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,250
make deals to like say hey this year

522
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,750
we're anticipating on making a million

523
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,360
more of these so give us a better deal

524
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,850
on this chip or these resistors and so

525
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,020
on

526
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,520
but that can only go so far so

527
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,200
ultimately when ends up happening is

528
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,970
they start turning towards what can we

529
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,780
do to eke out more cost let's go with

530
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,190
cheaper labor and cheaper assets so the

531
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,169
tools that you use to make the products

532
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,320
whether it's fixtures or logic analyzers

533
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,980
or what-have-you and then what what that

534
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,809
means for labor in particular is you end

535
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:29,080
up with a very interchangeable set of

536
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,250
engineers that are working on the

537
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,799
project

538
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,990
so you're basically driving out all the

539
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,200
core competencies in your company

540
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,960
amongst your engineers as a result maybe

541
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,530
you'll hire in temporarily a specialist

542
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,049
as a contractor but they will probably

543
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:50,650
not be your long-term engineer so that

544
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,260
means that you end up with kind of

545
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,230
withering core competencies that could

546
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,660
be that mean that it's you know you're

547
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,850
gonna have to make up for that in other

548
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,720
ways okay

549
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,299
now the big thing the big thing that

550
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:09,490
we've thought I think we've done is as

551
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,280
as the maker movement in particular is

552
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,530
we've changed how we do hiring we've

553
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,970
impacted how corporations look at hiring

554
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,490
so it used to be you would go into a

555
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,000
company and you would maybe pull out

556
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,669
your latest hardware project and then we

557
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:30,450
kind of glaze over maybe you get the job

558
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,160
maybe you wouldn't get the job but they

559
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,200
didn't know how to how to conduct a

560
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,510
discussion with you now they're more

561
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,970
than happy for you to bring in stuff in

562
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,140
fact they probably know

563
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,790
about you by the time you get there so

564
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,390
they probably saw you at a hackathon saw

565
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,450
your project history on hackaday IO or

566
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,950
github they saw your open source

567
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,770
contributions maybe there was even a

568
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,270
hacker job fair so they've already

569
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,640
looked you up in essence they know a lot

570
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,620
about what you can do before you even go

571
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,390
in for the interview and that's because

572
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,880
you're driving that with your passion

573
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,400
and that's a big difference than what

574
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,710
used to be used to be very much do you

575
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,960
have the degree do you hey can you pass

576
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,140
the phone screen it was do you know the

577
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,850
right words to unlock the gates and

578
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,460
because we have we have this maker

579
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,040
movement and open-source software it

580
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,080
basically has made it such that anyone

581
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,690
can basically learn this and can with

582
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,500
the with enough hard work get access to

583
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:38,100
what was once kept from from them okay

584
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,120
okay I got the 5-minute buzzer I didn't

585
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,330
think that was gonna happen okay so if

586
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,450
so let's go back to innovation dream so

587
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,880
if we're not funding corporations very

588
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,370
well we're not funding the projects VCS

589
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,250
don't want to fund anything that also

590
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,530
means that you know our engineering

591
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,210
teams aren't really getting a whole lot

592
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,710
of things because they're not working on

593
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,660
interesting projects and they're not

594
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,030
gonna bring anything to the company so

595
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,490
core competencies are going down that

596
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,260
means that the only way to sustain

597
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,090
corporate innovation is buying it

598
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,260
licensing externally now where they're

599
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,490
buying that can very great deal but if

600
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,320
they fail to do that let's say one year

601
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,540
they don't make their market cap they

602
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,670
start losing market share and it means

603
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,900
that they won't be able to keep

604
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,690
innovating primarily by buying that

605
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,970
means that overall that company will

606
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,310
start dwindling and shrinking if you

607
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,290
have enough of an industry doing that

608
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,870
that industry will shift will shrink

609
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:46,390
itself and worse yet you will end up

610
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,230
with an industry especially if it

611
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,720
impacts the economy heavily let's say in

612
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,290
the United

613
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,990
the economy itself can shrink so it's

614
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:00,690
very important to find forward Rd at a

615
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,940
critical level in order to sustain the

616
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,910
economy long term okay so it goes

617
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,550
without saying from that last slide the

618
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,050
work that we do here even at this

619
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,240
conference hacking on badges ends up

620
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,780
impacting the economy a lot although it

621
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,160
may be difficult to see and I'm hoping

622
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,330
that you'll be able to see that from

623
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,630
this talk so without us not a lot of new

624
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,120
ideas and companies would not exist so

625
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,910
let's look at how that is we not only

626
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,800
have we influenced an entire generation

627
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,310
of new creators but the way that people

628
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:36,100
start their projects is vastly different

629
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,320
than what it used to be it used to be

630
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,200
you had an idea you design a board as a

631
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,000
prototype and you see how that worked

632
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,730
out now we can start with any number of

633
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,740
different platforms that are cost down

634
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,290
and readily accessible to start working

635
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,500
on a proof-of-concept and as I mentioned

636
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,330
there are a lot of tools and tool chains

637
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,050
such as GCC that you can use to develop

638
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:02,920
any of your embedded projects if you

639
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,230
just even go back 15 years is there

640
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,910
anyone in this room that was like a

641
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,970
firmware an embedded engineer like in

642
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:15,110
the early 2000s or even 90s 80s

643
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,760
it hasn't changed that much it still

644
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,500
sucks so so let's get it may still suck

645
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,850
but it's cheaper yeah so so let's talk

646
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,630
about that so it's so what heads up

647
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,340
happen is it used to be for a single

648
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,559
person check me on this for a single

649
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,480
person you'd buy the compiler

650
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,460
there would be an IDE you need to buy

651
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,010
the debugger and that on average would

652
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,710
cost ten thousand dollars for a single

653
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:51,830
person now most of the tools are free

654
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,580
platforms near free the debugger still

655
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,409
cost money but you can get it like

656
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,320
hundreds of dollars not several hundreds

657
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,510
like you could get it under 100 if you

658
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,799
really tried and that's a huge deal

659
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,330
because that also contributes to the

660
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,889
fact that people can now learn on their

661
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:14,899
own dime do what they want and they're

662
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:16,519
no longer you know they're no longer

663
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,200
forced to do whatever corporation says

664
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,179
because honestly I don't see a lot of

665
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:23,059
companies funding training the way that

666
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:27,440
they used to so that means now you can

667
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,740
do the training that you want but that's

668
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,230
also going to change how we go to

669
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,929
conferences this conference is great

670
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:38,330
because it doesn't break the bank it's

671
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,549
not like going to the embedded systems

672
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:43,399
conference or java world or whatever the

673
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:45,350
heck which costs thousands of dollars

674
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:50,150
and you may or may not even take a class

675
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,789
[Music]

676
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:55,549
okay I'm gonna hurry through this but

677
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:59,539
the point is is that you look at all of

678
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:02,330
the established media companies today

679
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,740
and these media companies are unable to

680
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,909
they can't figure out what we want

681
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:09,350
anymore and they can't make it cost down

682
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,740
enough to fit us what we want these days

683
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,179
is like we want a little bit of a TED

684
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:16,990
talk we want a mixture of

685
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:20,210
demos meeting Lots meeting lots of

686
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,830
people and of course lots of hacking in

687
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:26,600
between so they just can't figure it out

688
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,730
and that's why conferences like these

689
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,409
are great okay so we're in a powerful

690
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:31,940
position I'm probably gonna go over one

691
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,480
minute oh my god but we can't take for

692
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,240
granted any of this so we need to avoid

693
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,340
making the mistakes that our industry

694
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,240
has kind of made without us so we've

695
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,350
done a great job of making things

696
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,539
cheaper and easier but we've struggled

697
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:49,159
with quality that's definitely something

698
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:51,139
that we should work on we've done a

699
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:53,899
great job of opening the gates to lots

700
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:55,429
of people who otherwise have been kept

701
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:57,409
out we should continue on that and we

702
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:59,480
should definitely not presume that once

703
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,549
we've done it that is that those design

704
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,440
decisions and styles shouldn't be

705
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,720
revisited again okay here's the part

706
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,379
we're gonna make some really

707
00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:08,029
embarrassing predictions about the

708
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:11,529
future and I think they're very worth it

709
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,029
I'm probably gonna get laughed at for

710
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,399
some of these okay so eventually

711
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,519
everyone is gonna learn PCB design in

712
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,480
high schools right alongside coding I

713
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,919
think that CS degrees will require you

714
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,070
to be much more rounded engineer so

715
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,509
you'll have to learn ethics you'll have

716
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:34,129
to learn project management you'll have

717
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:36,139
to learn basic software development

718
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:37,700
skills beyond just like how to reverse a

719
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,460
link list

720
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,960
vendor specific tool chains are gonna

721
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,029
die a horrible death and I think we're

722
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:46,070
well on our way given the whole FPGA

723
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,100
thing right now so that's exciting

724
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,059
although I do want to point out I do

725
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:52,309
think that companies large corporations

726
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,289
who are using these open these

727
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:57,019
open-source tools should start donating

728
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:59,120
money based on how much they're using to

729
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,149
help sustain and maintain these these

730
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:03,470
tool sets and I really think we should

731
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:09,710
start asking for that I think there'll

732
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,409
be another breakthrough language you'll

733
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:14,330
see that there will be another

734
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,509
breakthrough language that we're going

735
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,740
to get between firmware hardware and

736
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,820
software engineers and it won't be

737
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,129
Python eventually the United States will

738
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:24,649
demand more EU style privacy protections

739
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:25,580
and I think that's going to provide a

740
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,190
great opportunity for the open-source

741
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,870
community to ensure that

742
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,450
our data is protected and managed on our

743
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,799
own site and never left out of our

744
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:36,860
control and I think that that means that

745
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,450
open-source community will need an

746
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,120
nonprofit to file and manage a patent

747
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,429
portfolio to make sure that where the

748
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:46,179
ideas can be sustained in this world and

749
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:48,500
I think that means that we need an

750
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,570
open-source flying car hopefully in the

751
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:56,070
next 20 years okay thank you so much

752
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:01,359
[Applause]
