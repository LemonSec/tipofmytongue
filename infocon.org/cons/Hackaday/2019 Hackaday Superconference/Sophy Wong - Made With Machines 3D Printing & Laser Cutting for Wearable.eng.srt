our next speaker is a designer maker and

6
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,510
writer who primarily works with wearable

7
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,850
electronics by working with things like

8
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,370
microcontrollers and 3d printing she

9
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,440
explores the innocent intersection of

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,360
technology and designing for the human

11
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,600
body she publishes tutorials in hack

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,360
space magazine make magazine and on

adafruit.com her talk today takes us

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,370
through 3d printing and laser cutting

15
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,010
for wearable electronics please welcome

16
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,750
to the hackaday super conference stage

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:36,330
Sophie Wong so I'm a designer and a

18
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:44,130
maker and I'm a designer and a maker

19
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,350
they make a lot of wearable tech

20
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,150
projects make things like this and I

21
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,340
make a lot of aesthetic product projects

22
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,620
I make a lot of costumes and I'm very

23
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,260
interested in wearable tech because I

24
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,200
like the challenge of designing for the

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,690
human body and I'm really interested in

26
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,570
the ways that technology is becoming

27
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,330
more integrated into our lives and into

28
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,570
our identities and into our presentation

29
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,750
of our identities and lately have been

30
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,850
making a lot of things with machines

31
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,989
I've been using my laser cutter to make

32
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:25,290
jewelry to use materials like acrylic

33
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,750
and wood and even just cardboard this is

34
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,049
a like a costume motorized wing

35
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:37,200
sometimes I incorporate technology and

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,930
electronics into the piece itself so

37
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,260
this is a little capacitive copper tape

38
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,320
pad that just sometimes when I touch it

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,000
and it opens and closes the wing and

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,549
then sometimes the technology is just a

41
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,060
tool that I use for making the piece as

42
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,070
in this 3d printed jewelry and I

43
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,819
realized that

44
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,010
use actually a lot of different kinds of

45
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,650
machines in my work sometimes I use

46
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,909
sewing machines and band saws but today

47
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,590
I want to talk about a specific kind of

48
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,510
machine and that's this kind of machine

49
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,639
these are machines that have a CAD

50
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,700
component incorporated into their

51
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,549
process and so this is my 3d printer

52
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,599
it's a Cree ality CR 10s and my laser

53
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,209
cutter is a glowforge laser cutters or

54
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,310
claw Forge basic and I'm just starting

55
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,519
to learn how to use a Bantam CNC mill

56
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,389
and and I've listed the software that I

57
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,400
use most often when I work with these

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,969
machines

59
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,549
because you cannot talk about the

60
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,500
hardware you can't talk about using

61
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,840
these machines without talking about the

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,829
software involved and really the design

63
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,989
required to create the object because

64
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,709
these machines as powerful as they are

65
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,109
they won't do anything without digital

66
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,169
design instructions and that's exciting

67
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:03,239
for me because I'm a designer my

68
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,579
background is in graphic design so it's

69
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,859
kind of my language these machines speak

70
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:11,129
my language and I love that they have a

71
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,560
CAD component because I'm really in my

72
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,870
element when I'm working in Illustrator

73
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,699
and I've had to learn a lot of these

74
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,639
other programs so that I can communicate

75
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,820
well with my machines but as much as I

76
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,289
love working with my machines the magic

77
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:28,919
doesn't happen

78
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,060
inside the machine and I think about

79
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,759
this a lot when I think back to many

80
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,500
years ago when I learned how to sew when

81
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,590
I first learned how to sew I used to

82
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,110
think that sewing was like sitting down

83
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,479
at a sewing machine and sewing at a

84
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,870
sewing machine and if anyone here sews I

85
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,539
know there are some people here who sew

86
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:54,719
that sewing machine portion is like 10%

87
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:58,849
of sewing and the other 90% of sewing is

88
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:01,940
preparing your fabric pressing it

89
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,560
patterning cutting out your fabric

90
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,789
pinning basting fitting realizing it

91
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:10,460
doesn't fit on

92
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,069
stingray basting and by the time you get

93
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:15,500
to the sewing machine portion you are

94
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,099
well well into your project and it might

95
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,479
just be the blink of an eye that you're

96
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,759
sewing a couple of seams on the sewing

97
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,889
machine so even though that machine is

98
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:28,130
really enabling you to do a lot it takes

99
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,319
a lot of work to get to the point where

100
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,300
you're ready to use it and it's a

101
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,669
similar situation when you work with 3d

102
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,710
printers and laser cutters I think

103
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,660
there's an idea out there I certainly

104
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,069
had this idea when I started working

105
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:43,070
with these machines that using a 3d

106
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,930
printer using the laser cutter in your

107
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,380
creative work is going to save you a lot

108
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,650
of time or alleviate a lot of the tedium

109
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,349
because the machine is doing a lot of

110
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:55,699
the work for you

111
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,520
and I used to think maybe you know you

112
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,259
buy the 3d printer you press the magic

113
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,909
button and like the cool pops out

114
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:05,360
and yes there is definitely a moment

115
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,710
where you get to press the button and

116
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,780
the cool pops out but it's really

117
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,659
the journey to pressing the button where

118
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:14,000
all the work happens and it's actually

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,530
the exciting part for me because that's

120
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,289
where all the design happens so I'm not

121
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:20,659
gonna you know teach you about using the

122
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,849
3ds the 3d printer or the laser cutter

123
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,979
specifically in this talk but I'm gonna

124
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,469
take you on the journey to pressing the

125
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:29,270
button we're gonna go in a few journeys

126
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,130
to moments where I got to press the

127
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,320
magic button I'm sorry for saying the S

128
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,780
word my mom is probably watching so this

129
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,580
base suit that I made this is my

130
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,530
spacesuit this is a really good example

131
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,580
of this and this is something that I

132
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,030
made largely with my laser cutter so the

133
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,389
fabric portion the base suit is sewn on

134
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:55,370
my sewing machine but all of the rigid

135
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,009
areas like on the chest piece that's

136
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:02,030
laser-cut evie a foam and the helmet has

137
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,280
a lot of laser-cut UVA foam on it as

138
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,199
well and I really started with the

139
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,570
helmet because that's what I wanted I

140
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,250
really just wanted a helmet with lights

141
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,270
in it

142
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,460
don't put lights in your helmet because

143
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,440
you can't see out but it looks really

144
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,860
badass so maybe do so it started out

145
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,940
looking like this

146
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,930
I bought a costume helmet and I started

147
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,000
by patterning directly off the helmet

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,640
with blue tape and I just drew the

149
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,760
shapes that I wanted on to the tape cut

150
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,390
them out and scan them into my computer

151
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,450
and then once I had those shapes scanned

152
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,290
in I digitized them in Illustrator and I

153
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,760
could cut them on my laser cutter and

154
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,940
this is the process I use often I go

155
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,890
really fluidly between the digital world

156
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,600
the physical world the digital world I'd

157
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,660
go back and forth a lot in my work and

158
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,100
so I started cutting these long skinny

159
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,290
shapes that wrap really nicely over a

160
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,840
spherical surface and you just kept

161
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,670
going I kept looking at the piece and

162
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,520
deciding what shapes I wanted and

163
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,050
cutting them out and the laser cutters

164
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,910
really cool because you it does more

165
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,780
than just cut so I used it to score a

166
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,520
lot of really intricate design lines

167
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,670
into my pieces and he used it to engrave

168
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,580
a lot of textures and doing this allowed

169
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,770
me to create the illusion of multiple

170
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,260
materials within my piece so even though

171
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,020
it's all Eevee a foam I use these

172
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,659
patterns and these textures to sort of

173
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,340
fool your eye into thinking it might be

174
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,409
different kinds of metal or different

175
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,450
kinds of plastic and once I started

176
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,280
painting them they really started to

177
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,059
transform and this is a look at the file

178
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,370
that I used to create the color of the

179
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,100
helmet and one of the issues you get to

180
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,050
when you're trying to make a large-scale

181
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,030
wearable in a machine is you're very

182
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,450
limited by the bed by the output size of

183
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,100
your machine so you're always gonna have

184
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,050
to find a way to connect pieces together

185
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,200
and I decided that I wasn't gonna take

186
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,300
the time to hide seams in this project

187
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,930
so I used the lines the line motif that

188
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,500
I created to sort of play up the seams

189
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,240
and disguise them and hide them in plain

190
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,370
sight so here's what they look like once

191
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,740
they're cut and painted and that just

192
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,600
allowed me to create a full loop around

193
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,080
the helmet and adding paint just like

194
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,410
always transforms everything and I

195
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,820
really I think that I successfully

196
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,530
achieved the look of several different

197
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,930
textures and materials in this one piece

198
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,970
and it makes kind of a pretty convincing

199
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,050
piece of fantasies

200
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,180
and I got to this point I put the lights

201
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,860
in and I was like yes this is what I

202
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,339
wanted but now I need a spacesuit so I

203
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,070
went back to the beginning and I started

204
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,899
patterning again off of a physical

205
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,910
object this is another thing I do very

206
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,040
often when I'm building wearables and in

207
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,720
this case the physical object was my

208
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,540
body I wanted my wearable to fit me so I

209
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,459
just patterned directly off of my body

210
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,529
this is another really great cosplay a

211
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,870
technique so I wrapped myself in plastic

212
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,300
as you do and I drew the shapes just

213
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,440
directly on my body

214
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,899
and then cutting those shapes out and

215
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,000
flattening them out allow me to again

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,370
scan them into my computer and this time

217
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,699
I used garment techniques to create the

218
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:19,589
shape in the piece so you can see I

219
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,610
added some darts and an A actually

220
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,649
before you get to the laser cutter I

221
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:28,740
often print these shapes out just on

222
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,839
paper and tape them together and mock

223
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,790
them up and this is the fitting process

224
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,699
and it's really helpful to do this while

225
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:37,290
you're developing your wearable you

226
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,060
don't need to go directly to the final

227
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,180
material you can use cheaper more

228
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,069
expendable materials like paper to just

229
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:47,339
see if it's gonna work and again I use

230
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,040
this surface design lines to hide the

231
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,380
darts and the seams and so this line

232
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,980
motif became a really useful tool for me

233
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,170
in this project and of course have to

234
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,779
cut the torso in pieces that would fit

235
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,110
on my laser cutter and here it is flat

236
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,720
and you can see when it closed the darts

237
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,240
it really creates that volumetric shape

238
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,760
and it fit my body because I just

239
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,819
patterned it directly off my body so

240
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:16,230
that was the base layer and I kept

241
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,480
adding more layers and details and I use

242
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,339
the same process I patterned directly

243
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,949
off of this layer to get the next layer

244
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,310
and it just kept adding more pieces

245
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,170
digitizing them printing them out adding

246
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,850
them on and cutting and assembling

247
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,579
everything and slowly all the details

248
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,399
came together and you can see the pieces

249
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,079
look very flat when they're in my

250
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,620
computer but when you cut them out and

251
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,149
you hit them with a heat gun and you

252
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,459
really heat form the EBA foam you can

253
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,730
get these really curved geometric shapes

254
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,110
volumetric shapes

255
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,580
and then once you paint everything

256
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,500
together your eye just believes that

257
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,010
everything goes together and I got much

258
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,649
better at this technique of hiding the

259
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:01,080
seams in plain sight so this is probably

260
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,730
the most successful moment of that in

261
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,459
the piece you can see it in this case I

262
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,050
just added I've made the seam go

263
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,149
directly down the middle of the shoulder

264
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:11,970
piece and when you close that shoulder

265
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,370
seam up because I designed the line

266
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,399
motif to branch directly off of the seam

267
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,769
it's hidden it's completely hidden I

268
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:21,570
didn't need to do anything to the seam

269
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,870
once it was put together so for this

270
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,940
project I learned a lot about physical

271
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,190
patterning and using physical patterning

272
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,310
to create a large-scale wearable that I

273
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,019
could use that it could build with a

274
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,320
digital workflow and this whole piece

275
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,660
was done completely in 2d design I

276
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,209
didn't have to do any 3d modeling for

277
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:45,899
this piece but now let's talk about 3d

278
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,450
so last night I was wearing this jacket

279
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,420
it's a it's a jacket that has 3d printed

280
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,220
diffusers on the back and I have a

281
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,950
little sample here of the diffusers that

282
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,180
you can come and find me later and

283
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,420
diggle it because it's really jiggly so

284
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,520
use this technique of printing on fabric

285
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,550
to create the diffusers and and then I

286
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,470
added that to the back of the jacket and

287
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,209
added some lights onto the inside of the

288
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:12,300
jacket it's got a microcontroller with

289
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,370
several different light animation modes

290
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,220
in the pocket and I used a very similar

291
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,070
process to create this I started again

292
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,560
by patterning with tape directly off of

293
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,930
the jacket and deciding what shape I

294
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,120
wanted to make peeling off the tape

295
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,000
scanning that in and digitizing that

296
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,850
shape in Illustrator and then this is my

297
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,940
additional step for this jacket so then

298
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,040
once I created that 2d file in

299
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,320
Illustrator I brought it into fusion and

300
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,360
I extruded it and that's all I did

301
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,510
that's really the level of ability that

302
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,579
I had in fusion at the time when I built

303
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,970
this really just extrude so this project

304
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,680
is just one extrude and then I slice

305
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,750
that in Keira and I use this printing on

306
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,870
fabric technique which is really cool I

307
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,690
saw

308
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,490
at the work of David Shore II who does a

309
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,710
lot of experimentation and beautiful

310
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,960
work with printing 3d printing on fabric

311
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,940
and I wanted to try that for myself so

312
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,590
this project was my first attempt at

313
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,810
that and so to do that

314
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,770
ie print one layer of the of the model

315
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,900
and then I added the fabric into the

316
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,610
printer and then printed the rest of the

317
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,920
model and because it's a cellular design

318
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,220
the fabric gets gets trapped between the

319
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,620
first two layers and you get this really

320
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,540
flexible print because the fabrics

321
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:37,110
connecting those cellular shapes and

322
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,220
here's you can see what it looks like on

323
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,990
the bed here's when it comes off it's so

324
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,490
satisfying when you pull this off the

325
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,210
bed and because I started with a 2d

326
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,470
design file

327
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,410
I had this SVG that I could just print

328
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,200
and use as a 2d template for my jacket

329
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,060
so this is how we got the lights to line

330
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,180
up perfectly underneath my 3d printed

331
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,480
diffusers I basically just cut holes

332
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,160
punched holes where I wanted the lights

333
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,350
to go and mark that out on my jacket and

334
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,910
because they come from the same file

335
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,850
everything matches up perfectly I added

336
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,500
the lights to the inside of the jacket

337
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,110
so they're hidden underneath the lining

338
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,800
and you can see on one side I've just

339
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,570
got the lights installed there neopixel

340
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:24,790
leds and I felt like really happy with

341
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,410
this and I actually wear this jacket a

342
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,200
lot I get a lot of use out of it and I

343
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,020
was really excited by this idea of this

344
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,330
concept of printing 3d printing on

345
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,400
fabric I was really excited to try to

346
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,310
take this a little bit further but I

347
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,980
knew that I was dreaming beyond my skill

348
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,260
set at this point I knew that I was

349
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,320
limited by my lack of ability in fusion

350
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,240
360 so I decided to change that and in

351
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,210
August I did 31 days of fusion 360 so I

352
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,710
challenged myself to make something in

353
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,210
fusion everyday for 31 days and he did

354
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,310
this because I realized that there are

355
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,490
two parts to learning anything there's

356
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,400
knowledge and then there's practice and

357
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:12,710
I

358
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,340
realize that I was only using fusion

359
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,920
with knowledge so I would use it in the

360
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,480
middle of a project with something I

361
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,790
wanted to make and it would look up on

362
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,950
the web a tutorial that would help me do

363
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,510
the one thing I wanted to do in that

364
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,250
moment and then I would consume that

365
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,770
knowledge do that thing and then move on

366
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,590
and I never circled back to practice

367
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,080
that thing so I actually had no

368
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,420
retention and I found that I was

369
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,990
watching the same tutorial over and over

370
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,200
again just like three months apart and I

371
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,060
realized I wasn't I wasn't learning it I

372
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,620
was like god I'm not learning any of

373
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,170
this I need to actually spend some time

374
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,880
just practicing so I decided to dedicate

375
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,300
just a couple of hours every night to

376
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,160
working it in fusion and it sounds like

377
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,630
a lot to make something in fusion

378
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,760
everyday but I kept the requirement very

379
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,849
very low just make something anything a

380
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,220
cube it doesn't matter you know don't

381
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,290
spend a lot of time designing because I

382
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,959
wasn't trying to practice design I was

383
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,839
trying to practice fusion so I started

384
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,790
just modeling existing objects and

385
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,859
things around my house just copying

386
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:24,560
things and practicing the small things

387
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,349
like making components and using the

388
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,350
different tools and I found I didn't try

389
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,410
to do new things every time I tried to

390
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,780
repeat things so when I used the pattern

391
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,690
tool I used it like four days in a row

392
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,130
and I really found that I started to go

393
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,280
way beyond extrude and I started to

394
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,160
enjoy my time in fusion more because it

395
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,340
wasn't like a mine crushingly

396
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,480
frustrating experience every time

397
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,900
because I I was building familiarity and

398
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,420
it was building habits and it was it was

399
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,270
so much better then I made a lot of

400
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,580
wacky things during that month like a 3d

401
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,100
printed clothespin but do you know the

402
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,100
point wasn't to make amazing things that

403
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,980
month the point was to learn fusion and

404
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,270
I made way more than 31 things in 31

405
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,210
days I found that after a while I wanted

406
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,890
to spend more time in it so it would

407
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,020
spend four hours or five hours and it

408
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,640
would make more complex things because I

409
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,639
was enjoy

410
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,289
and he felt like I had a handle on it

411
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:30,599
and I could go further and actually

412
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,109
attempt what I wanted to do so I wanted

413
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:35,999
to see if I could expand this 3d

414
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:38,039
printing on fabric technique to a whole

415
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,950
garment and that's what I have here this

416
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,340
is just the bodice for now and when I

417
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,259
get back I'm gonna dive into making the

418
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,690
skirt portion and honestly I've learned

419
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,359
so much just getting this far that there

420
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,499
are so many things I'm gonna do

421
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,200
differently when I get to the skirt but

422
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,359
here's a look at my fusion file so this

423
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,669
is actually you know of a week and a

424
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:03,589
half ago so at this point it only had

425
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:06,559
1612 bodies in it and now it has about

426
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,169
2,000 and it's crazy like I went from

427
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:13,200
that 3d printed clothespin to this you

428
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,619
know but I didn't start here it started

429
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:19,289
with small samples and I have a bunch of

430
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:20,999
the samples with me so please come and

431
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:22,499
find me I'd love for you to just hold

432
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:24,179
them in your hands they're just they're

433
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,889
just amazing and I really what I wanted

434
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:31,589
to do was to see how different shapes

435
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:34,440
would affect the properties of the

436
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,769
fabric and so I'm looking at different

437
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:40,320
lines different shapes different spacing

438
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,039
the height of the print and the project

439
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,679
really has become an exploration of the

440
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,889
material and of the design like how can

441
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:53,489
I change the properties and control the

442
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:56,009
behavior of the material purely through

443
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:58,289
design purely through the shape that I'm

444
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:00,719
applying the material in and it's really

445
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:04,409
exciting because I'm creating like new

446
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:07,799
behaviors and fabric that can't exist in

447
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,960
traditional woven fabric and

448
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,809
conventional fabric so this piece it's

449
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:16,349
crunches up in one axis really tightly

450
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,509
but then in the other axis if you try to

451
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,889
fold it it folds on these really

452
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:22,649
prescribed curved lines and you just

453
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:24,779
can't really do that with traditional

454
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,049
fabric so I'm also experimenting with

455
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:31,169
transparency and weight and drape and

456
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:32,789
I'm playing with curved and more

457
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:34,649
volumetric surfaces and I'm just I'm

458
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:37,019
trying to go beyond just extruding at 90

459
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:39,870
degrees anything you know I can

460
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,800
start a new like ASMR genre on YouTube

461
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,930
or like oddly satisfying cuz like I

462
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,650
can't I can't look away I thought this

463
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,809
piece looked kind of like a snake

464
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:53,100
someone else said they thought it looked

465
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,690
like a tire tread but it turned out we

466
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,460
were both wrong because it looks exactly

467
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,450
like a salmon filet and I have this

468
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,490
salmon fillet with me so you should come

469
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,450
and hold the salmon um visually I'm

470
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,280
really inspired for this piece by the

471
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,250
Klingons from Star Trek discovery I just

472
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,010
I love their kind of HR Giger meets you

473
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,190
know Edwardian court wear look and I'm

474
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,070
always inspired by the sort of feminine

475
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,250
and tech forward costumes of perfume

476
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,980
they're my favorite j-pop group but I'm

477
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,470
kind of leaving the visual design of

478
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,870
this alone I just I really want to

479
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,220
explore the technique so I'm just

480
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,580
keeping the Klingons and perfume in mind

481
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,920
so I I really used a very similar

482
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,570
process to what I've already described

483
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,790
for this I drafted a very simple bodice

484
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,910
um in the physical world that I could

485
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:49,440
cut into pieces and I generated so many

486
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,970
samples and tests and so many ideas

487
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,440
during my experimentation phase that I

488
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,720
want to circle back to but it's all way

489
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,850
too much for just one project so I

490
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,250
really needed to edit that down and

491
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,740
choose a few things that I thought would

492
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,059
work really well for this project I'm

493
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,429
always sketching and I'm referring back

494
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,950
to my inspiration as I sketch and as I

495
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,440
worked through my experiments and I

496
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,780
often will just take photos of my

497
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,120
mock-ups and print them out and sketch

498
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,030
directly on top of the photo and that

499
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,309
just helps me keep moving forward in my

500
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:28,470
sketching and helps me do like really

501
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,040
quick visual iteration so eventually I

502
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,450
got to a mock-up that I thought would

503
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,750
work and I cut it apart and scanned the

504
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,590
pieces into my computer digitize them in

505
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,030
Illustrator so this is a very familiar

506
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,559
process for me and I'm getting much

507
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,350
faster at it and then you started

508
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,720
working in fusion 360 and this is about

509
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,350
the point where my computer

510
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,000
just really didn't want to keep up with

511
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,590
how many bodies I was putting in this

512
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,200
file um like literally I couldn't mouse

513
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,540
over my selection sets because my

514
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,270
computer would just throw like fries you

515
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,700
know and so I had to move to a more

516
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,710
powerful computers to work on this file

517
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,080
and arguably fusion is maybe not the

518
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,060
right toys for designing something this

519
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,940
organic and I'm using their tools in

520
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,680
ways that you know I don't think that

521
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,920
they are expecting but sometimes the

522
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,930
right tool is the tool that you just

523
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:26,880
spent 31 days learning so and I've

524
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,980
picked this gorgeous filament impalement

525
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,540
a lot of people are asking me about this

526
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,130
filament because it's beautiful its

527
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,100
iridescent purple and it's called

528
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,120
wizards voodoo from filament 'im and I'm

529
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,670
discovering new ways to connect pieces

530
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,560
together so earlier I mentioned whenever

531
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,810
you work on wearables with machines

532
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,280
you're gonna have to figure out how to

533
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,130
connect pieces together and I discovered

534
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,630
that I can connect my pieces together

535
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,530
very seamlessly with my 3d pen so I

536
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,200
basically am leaving a seam allowance

537
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,420
around all of my pieces and then I cut

538
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,030
the seam allowance off of one side lay

539
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,520
the pieces next to each other flip them

540
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,790
over and then I use my 3d pen to

541
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,400
basically weld the pieces together and

542
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,310
I'm only applying the 3d pen on the

543
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,860
solid portions so it's maintaining the

544
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,670
flexibility really really well and you

545
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,140
think it's also distributing the weight

546
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,170
out I'm wracking up a lot of weight in

547
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,670
this in this piece and here you can see

548
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,770
it kind of flexing and moving and it's

549
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,880
really satisfying

550
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,250
so there's several seams in this one

551
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,540
piece but I it's not compromising at the

552
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,820
design I can still create the

553
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,890
flexibility that I want and control the

554
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,410
flexibility completely in my fusion file

555
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,090
so yeah I've actually I've learned so

556
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,430
much doing this making this piece and I

557
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,720
would love for you to come and find me

558
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,700
later and actually see it in person and

559
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,040
maybe you know see how it moves because

560
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,250
I think it's very different than then

561
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,970
the kind of 3d printing I've been

562
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,279
seeing in the past and the kind of 3d

563
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,230
prints I've been making in the past and

564
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,840
it's really exciting to me and I want

565
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,909
more people to be experimenting with

566
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:14,679
this because I think every time I see

567
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,620
someone else working in this way I

568
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,870
learned so much and I get new ideas and

569
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,029
so I just really want to share what I've

570
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:23,950
learned and learn from other people as

571
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:27,820
well so even though the focus of this

572
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,039
project is 3d printing

573
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:32,259
for me I really feel like I'm in a point

574
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:34,000
now where it doesn't feel like I'm being

575
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,490
controlled by the technology I feel like

576
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,710
it's a collaboration between me and the

577
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,139
Machine and I feel like the constraints

578
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,539
of the project are really empowering me

579
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:47,649
to turn my design brain on and find

580
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:50,440
innovative ways to still make the things

581
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,139
that I want to make using this

582
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:55,899
technology that's actually so accessible

583
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:58,539
now like my 3d printer is very basic 3d

584
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:01,809
printer just FDM pretty affordable and

585
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:05,620
available to so many people so if you're

586
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,210
interested in learning more about my

587
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,669
projects especially these three projects

588
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,259
I've written tutorials about most of

589
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:13,480
them the space suit is in the July issue

590
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,289
of Make Magazine and my space helmet and

591
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:19,720
my jacket are both in hack space

592
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,169
magazine and they're in my my book from

593
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:24,250
hack space which is a free download

594
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,250
which you can go to this very long URL

595
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,909
to get completely for free and if you

596
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:32,590
want to follow my 3d printed dress

597
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,110
project I'm posting a lot about it on my

598
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,629
Twitter and on my Instagram so you can

599
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,309
follow me there and I'll definitely make

600
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:40,570
a video about it on my youtube channel

601
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,519
eventually so you can follow me there

602
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,690
thank you so much

603
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,279
[Applause]
