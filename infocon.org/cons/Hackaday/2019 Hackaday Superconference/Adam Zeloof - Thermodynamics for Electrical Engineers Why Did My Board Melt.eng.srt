00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,410
[Applause]

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,480
thank you hi my name is Adams loof and

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,309
this is thermodynamics for electrical

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,860
engineers before we get into it yeah

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,269
it's the last day of super Khan I'm

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,670
tired you're all tired if my voice holds

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,109
out and you all stay awake to stock is

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,270
gonna be a massive success so thank you

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,439
for for listening in advance all right

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,119
so what's the point of this talk there's

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,949
gonna be a lot of math it's a really

12
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,660
math heavy subject thermodynamics for

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,359
anyone as a math heavy subject it's

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,549
there to illustrate what's going on it's

15
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,989
not there for you to memorize equations

16
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,850
or anything like that so all these

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,140
slides are posted online and there's a

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,129
link at the end if you want to go

19
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,230
through the math later you can just

20
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,910
don't ignore the math but don't you know

21
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,890
don't focus too hard on it the real

22
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,420
point of the talk is getting intuition

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,550
for what's actually going on in a

24
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,020
heat-transfer system and the three main

25
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,730
points that I kind of want its outline

26
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,460
here our heat transfer paths thermal

27
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,750
resistance which is a pretty helpful

28
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,160
concepts we'll get into in a minute and

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,620
conservation of energy that brings me to

30
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,480
my very first and the most important

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,620
point and if you want to just leave now

32
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,049
because this is the entire talk energy

33
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,119
is conserved the energy that goes into a

34
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,680
system comes out of a system with no

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,430
exceptions

36
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,659
that's the energy has to go somewhere to

37
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,460
actually expand on that a little bit

38
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,540
there let's talk about conduction

39
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,189
conduction is a mode of heat transfer

40
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,990
you're probably all very familiar if you

41
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,930
touch something hot and it feels hot if

42
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,299
I if I have a trunk of aluminum and I

43
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,220
apply some heat to one side the other

44
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,400
side is gonna warm up eventually

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,320
conduction is where heat is transferred

46
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,439
by molecules vibrating next to each

47
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,150
other in trans translating energy

48
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,299
between between other molecules that way

49
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,220
the simplest case I have drawn out here

50
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,759
it's just a one-dimensional wall there's

51
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,170
one side that's held at a hot

52
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,670
temperature and one side held at a cold

53
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,040
temperature and we have one-dimensional

54
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,740
conduction through this solid wall so

55
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,970
let's look at how we can actually find

56
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,829
the heat transfer through this system I

57
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,750
have some equations up here on the on

58
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,899
the slides the first one Q equals ka DT

59
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,149
DX it's a differential equation it's

60
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,469
ugly but let's look at what it actually

61
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,659
means K is a material property it's the

62
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,970
thermal conductivity so every material

63
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,610
has a value for that that's just a

64
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,010
constant we choose

65
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,510
is the cross-sectional area of the wall

66
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,040
so we're multiplying that material

67
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,530
property by its area and then DT DX is

68
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,390
just the change in temperature versus

69
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,430
the change in in like distance along the

70
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,110
wall let's ignore that and move over

71
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,090
this other one here where we just don't

72
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,829
write it as a differential equation at

73
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,879
all and we just write the change in

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,260
temperature over that that whole length

75
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,640
that's a great equation and it's useful

76
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,980
but we can simplify it a little bit and

77
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,780
make it a lot more portable and easy to

78
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,879
use let's talk about a thermal

79
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,629
resistance what if we take what if we

80
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,000
take this term here L over ka the length

81
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,950
of the wall times the thermal

82
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,590
conductivity in the area R divided by

83
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,879
the thermal conductivity in the area and

84
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,530
we pull that out as a resistance we can

85
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,359
now write that Q just is the change in

86
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,310
temperature over the resistance of the

87
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,299
wall and we could even draw it as a

88
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:01,700
resistor you're probably saying hey wait

89
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,409
and especially a lot of since a lot of

90
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:04,430
your electrical engineers you're

91
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,659
probably saying wait that looks really

92
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,639
familiar and you're right it's Ohm's law

93
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,510
but instead of current we have heat

94
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,280
transfer I should actually mention at

95
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,739
this point too I'm writing Q is heat I

96
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:17,359
say heat transfer I'm really talking

97
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:18,650
about a heat transfer rate that's

98
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,269
measured in watts you could write that

99
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:23,540
as Q dot I chose not to just keep that

100
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,699
in mind for this so the rate of heat

101
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:27,980
transfer is equal to the change in

102
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,569
temperature divided by the resistance

103
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:32,120
just like the rate of energy the current

104
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,220
moving through a circuit is equal to the

105
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,690
voltage drop divided by the resistance

106
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,970
it's the exact same thing and that lets

107
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,010
us do some really neat things with what

108
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,109
we're gonna call a thermal circuit

109
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:43,310
because we can take a complicated system

110
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,709
like this and represent it as a parallel

111
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,220
series combination of resistors it works

112
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,900
out the exact same way as it would in

113
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,489
the electrical world we can find there

114
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,260
is like in this case we have wall a and

115
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,419
wall eggh conducts heat into wall B and

116
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:58,280
wall C and wall and those conduct heat

117
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,449
into wall D and we're assuming there's

118
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,659
no conduction between B and C and it's a

119
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,220
pretty powerful analogy or because then

120
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,510
we can just draw this thermal circuit

121
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,690
and the resistance of this entire block

122
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,449
over here is found the exact same way

123
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:13,310
you'd find it for a thermal system it's

124
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,650
the resistance of a plus the parallel

125
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,180
combination of B and C plus the

126
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,019
resistance of D and then yeah we can

127
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,430
just write the same equation at the em Q

128
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,340
equals change in temperature over the

129
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,580
total resistance moving forward to that

130
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,080
another kind of a side here but worth

131
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,930
mentioning is contact resistance this is

132
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,130
something a lot of you probably have

133
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,050
experience with if you've ever put a new

134
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,389
new heatsink or new process or done

135
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:38,560
anything but the process or in the

136
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,360
heatsink in your computer you probably

137
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,800
had to clean the processor off clean the

138
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,139
heatsink off and then apply some thermal

139
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,510
paste to to one or the other before you

140
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,639
smush them together and that's because

141
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,350
no surface is actually smooth right if

142
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,270
you look in if you go in that room and

143
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,560
put any surface under a de McCombs

144
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,900
microscope you're gonna see that there's

145
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,180
a lot of roughness to anything even if

146
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,000
it looks totally smooth they like to

147
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,880
your unaided eye and that poses a

148
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,110
problem for conduction because remember

149
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,479
our equation had area in it and if we

150
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:09,510
have conduction between two surfaces and

151
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,310
that the surface area like the contact

152
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,780
area is actually really small because

153
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,860
there's only these like very small

154
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,720
patches touching where the jagged

155
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,729
surface is actually contact the area

156
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:20,260
goes down the ephemeral resistance goes

157
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,990
up and the conduction goes down it's

158
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,669
equally bad if we take those air gaps

159
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,200
and fill them with dirt or some other

160
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,380
like low conductivity substance and some

161
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,330
debris that we don't like but and the

162
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,890
heat sink example I just mentioned we

163
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,570
fill it with thermal paste and that

164
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,710
thermal paste is a really low

165
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,300
conductivity and it does a really good

166
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,370
job of filling all those gaps and it's

167
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,140
it just basically makes a better thermal

168
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,000
connection in that system in every

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,100
system energy is conserved that's not

170
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,360
the last time I'm gonna have this slide

171
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,039
up it's the most important part of this

172
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,810
talk just if you take away nothing else

173
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,310
energy is conserved heat in this heat

174
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,639
out but let's talk about convection

175
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,990
there are two modes of heat transfer I'm

176
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,130
gonna talk about in a second this is the

177
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,570
second one so we can move on in just a

178
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,910
minute but convection is really some of

179
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,889
the conduction except it's through the

180
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,240
air and other fluid and that's a

181
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,590
terrible description but it's at the

182
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,750
high level it's what you need to know

183
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,100
basically where I said conduction takes

184
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,539
place through vibrating molecules in a

185
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,580
solid convection takes place through

186
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,050
molecules bouncing around into each

187
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,720
other or like the molecules in the solid

188
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,330
vibrating and then that vibration

189
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,860
excites molecules in the air that's

190
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,970
touching it and those start to bounce

191
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,229
around it's just where molecules move

192
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:30,880
instead of vibrate in place instead of a

193
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,950
material property or material constant

194
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,659
here that thermal conductivity k we have

195
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,310
h the heat transfer coefficient

196
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,140
it's kind of a similar idea except

197
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,430
instead of just being intrinsic to the

198
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,020
material we can calculate it for

199
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,390
different cases that gets a to be a

200
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,950
really ugly calculation it can involve

201
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,870
like surface integrals and sorts of

202
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,370
things that I don't want to do because I

203
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,690
haven't had to do them since college and

204
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,720
I don't feel like it so we can guess

205
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,240
honestly for a heat transfer coefficient

206
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,700
and I have a nice table here of like

207
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,770
nice ballpark values you can pick but

208
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,510
before we get into the table let's look

209
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,710
at the math that actually makes it work

210
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,810
that's kind of similar to our conduction

211
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,210
equation from before Q equals H that

212
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,860
heat transfer coefficient and I drew a

213
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,780
bar over that's just like the overall

214
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,370
average heat sir heat transfer

215
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,560
coefficient for the system that times

216
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,330
the surface area times the change in

217
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,670
temperature now we can do what we did

218
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,200
before we can pull out a resistance term

219
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,940
in this case for convection the

220
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,670
resistance term is 1 over H times the

221
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,770
area but then the equation at the end

222
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,720
becomes the exact same thing Q is Delta

223
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,240
temperature over resistance so that lets

224
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,620
us add convection to our thermal

225
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,760
circuits and we'll show that in a few

226
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,560
minutes too

227
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,190
I mentioned we can just pick values of H

228
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,750
for air in free convection and free

229
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,620
convection is where the air is I almost

230
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,960
said not moving it is moving the heat

231
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,340
transfer through the air causes it to

232
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,620
move but the distinction really comes

233
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,750
from like what causes it to move so if

234
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,430
the heat transfer if the heat moving

235
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,750
through the air is making the air move

236
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,060
that's free convection it's like it's

237
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,350
basically stagnant air it's barely

238
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,840
moving forced convection to be throw a

239
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,130
fan in there and it starts blowing air

240
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,620
over it or the maybe like the this thing

241
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,420
you're designing is on the outside of a

242
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,220
car and your the car is driving the air

243
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,150
is moving over it that's force

244
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,320
convection you're pulling heat away from

245
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,560
it so we have air and free and errant

246
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,360
force convection and you can see there's

247
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,540
a pretty big jump in the the overall

248
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,130
heat transfer coefficient there if you

249
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,420
have water and free convection if you

250
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,070
can water cool the system even like

251
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,240
without the water moving just like

252
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,340
stagnant water the heat transfer

253
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,930
coefficient goes up massively by a

254
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,090
couple orders of magnitude then of

255
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,590
course the best solution is just molten

256
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,850
metals flowing in tubes that's the

257
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,530
ridiculously high number just do that

258
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,730
for everything submerge everything in

259
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,240
molten metals before we stop talking

260
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,010
about convection I want to cover fins

261
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,500
and extended surfaces actually I'll back

262
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,540
up a slide remember in this equation

263
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,670
area was really important let's just

264
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,050
increase the area

265
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,060
the example I mentioned earlier heatsink

266
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,530
on a computer processor excuse me

267
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,060
heatsink on a computer processor the

268
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,800
reason that heat sink is covered in fins

269
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,660
is because that's a really nice way to

270
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,980
increase the surface area without

271
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,870
increasing the volume too much so

272
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,070
there's a lot more there's way more

273
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,710
surfaces for that heat to transfer out

274
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,870
of the object simplest film would just

275
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,950
be a single bra that's called an

276
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,200
extended surface and any kind of

277
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,880
additional surface area is better than

278
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,020
nothing if you can't put a whole heat

279
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,310
sink in your design it's better just to

280
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,080
have some kind of larger surface area

281
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,630
for it to work with but yeah that just

282
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,020
increases the area term basically energy

283
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,640
is conserved that's the last time the

284
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,080
slides ended I promise but I'm gonna say

285
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,890
it one or two more times

286
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,860
all right let's actually run a little

287
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,740
example here because this is a hardware

288
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,420
hacking conference I figured we should

289
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,790
do a an example of a component heating

290
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,490
up on a circuit board this is a pretty

291
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,980
complicated example there's 3d

292
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,450
conduction taking place in the little

293
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,560
component in the middle of the board

294
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,390
there there's 3d conduction taking place

295
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,030
in the circuit board and then there's a

296
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,210
ton of phases for convection to take

297
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,220
place on the equation I have up in the

298
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,510
middle there is the partial differential

299
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,490
equation that covers 3d conduction only

300
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,320
it's awful there's a lot going on let's

301
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,130
let's not do that

302
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,950
it's really complicated so let's do some

303
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,820
engineering let's keep making

304
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,320
assumptions until we can solve this

305
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,470
problem without too much work I

306
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,520
simplified it a lot here now we just

307
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,310
have the component and this like little

308
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,100
stock up of the board with component to

309
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,600
solder mask layers on either side of the

310
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,800
board and then the copper and then the

311
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,950
fiberglass or fr4 in the middle so

312
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,810
what's this look like if you want to

313
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,130
figure out the heat transfer from the

314
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,530
component to the board so what's this

315
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,720
look like we have the thickness of all

316
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,180
these different parts here we have a lot

317
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,740
of services for convection to take place

318
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,330
on but a lot fewer because now it's this

319
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,400
little basically a 1 dimensional heat

320
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,770
transfer stack we have heat being

321
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,970
generated in the middle of the chip

322
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,580
there were a little Sun icon and then we

323
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,080
also care about the chip surface area

324
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,420
and the board surface area I'm gonna

325
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,650
make some kind of weird assumptions here

326
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,480
and they're not good assumptions but

327
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,480
they work for this problem we're gonna

328
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,950
assume that everything is a perfect

329
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,930
lateral insulator so he can only travel

330
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,820
basically up and down as I've drawn it

331
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,890
here except the copper once he gets in

332
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,760
the copper it's

333
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,750
Red's out to the entire board

334
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,700
immediately and I'm okay making that

335
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,170
assumption because copper has a really

336
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,140
high conductivity so it's not a great

337
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,720
way to represent that but actually

338
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,430
representing that accurately means like

339
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,870
numerical simulations solving in a

340
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,400
computer and we're not doing that this

341
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,630
is quick and dirty calculations so let's

342
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,250
convert what I just had drawn on the

343
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,340
board to a thermal circuit and I'm gonna

344
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,530
flip back and forth few times here there

345
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,350
are three heat paths that we look at the

346
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,210
first one from the center of the chip

347
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,710
he'd get heats generated in the center

348
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,720
it conducts through about half the chip

349
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,340
and then it can vex out through the top

350
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,610
of the chip to the air around it so if

351
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,620
you look at this here you can see we

352
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,450
have the chip temperature all the way on

353
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,260
the left here and then the top path is

354
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,940
chip resistance and then chip air

355
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,270
resistance and it gets out to the air we

356
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,810
can also go from the chip down through

357
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,210
half the chip through the solder mask

358
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,920
just the area right under the chip and

359
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,390
into the copper once it it's the copper

360
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,160
like I said it's everywhere the heat

361
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,540
kind of conducts outwards to the edges

362
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,610
it goes back up through the solder mask

363
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,270
and then can convexity the air there so

364
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,040
we can see that with our like lower and

365
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,900
middle path they chip and go through

366
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,580
half the chip through the solder mask

367
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,040
and then it kind of goes up through the

368
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,570
solder mask again through more of the

369
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,860
solder mask cuz now you have the entire

370
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,150
board to work with not just the chip

371
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,490
area and then out to the air and we're

372
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,610
at the aragon last path would just this

373
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,800
is a pretty straightforward one we go

374
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,910
through the bottom half of the chip do

375
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,770
the solder mask spread out to all the

376
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,060
board through the copper go through the

377
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,740
copper through the fiberglass and

378
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,380
through the solder mask can probably

379
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,490
imagine there's not a lot of heat going

380
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,900
that way because the fiberglass is a

381
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,310
good insulator and there's a lot of it

382
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,440
so that's probably the like the least

383
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,550
amount of heat transferring through that

384
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,840
path but we're gonna take it take it

385
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,120
into account anyway because we can it's

386
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,750
not that hard to add alright this slide

387
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,420
is utterly disgusting I'm sorry but it's

388
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,920
important to include especially if

389
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,090
you're gonna follow along later and try

390
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,550
to run the math on your own and we can

391
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,530
really break it down pretty simply the

392
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,390
top equation is just the parallel series

393
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,950
combination of all those resistors we

394
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,260
drew on the previous slide I'm not going

395
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,760
to read through it but you can you know

396
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,250
you can read that on your own and then

397
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,790
on the Left we have

398
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,649
conduction equations so all of the

399
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:21,209
conduction resistance terms and then on

400
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:22,350
the right the convection resistance

401
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,699
terms and they're all basically the same

402
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,529
thing just with different values plugged

403
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:30,810
in yeah it's not too much also else to

404
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,190
say about this slide it's just figuring

405
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,399
out values for everything to make up for

406
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,480
that awful slide here's my dog gunner

407
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,500
yeah take us I can do appreciate him all

408
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:43,880
right

409
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,930
let's actually find the temperature of

410
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,149
the system so again this is with how we

411
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:49,680
have heat being generated in the center

412
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,050
of a chip and we want to find how hot

413
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,019
the chip gets so I'm not gonna go

414
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,279
through all of these parameters I picked

415
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,040
on the side here the top four just like

416
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,480
dimensions of the chip on the board I

417
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,410
assumed that we're working with a 1

418
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,970
ounce copper board so that's where the

419
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,589
copper thickness came from solder mask

420
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,329
and see an fr4 I just kind of guessed

421
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,430
picked a chip area and a board area I

422
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,800
think the chip was one centimeter square

423
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,630
and the board to send some meter square

424
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,889
but I could have been wrong I might be

425
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:22,889
wrong about that and then this is kind

426
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:24,959
of interesting we have if you look at

427
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,250
the thermal conductivity there the K

428
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,649
values epoxy is really small 1.5 watts

429
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:32,339
per meter Kelvin solder mask 0.2 watts

430
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,560
per meter Kelvin coppers 400 watts per

431
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,910
meter Kelvin and that's why I said we

432
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,079
can kind of make that assumption where

433
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,550
once it hits the copper it conducts all

434
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,810
the way out to the edges because it's

435
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,750
super conductive well not super

436
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,440
conductive it's very conductive I also

437
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,660
picked the value of H as five watts per

438
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,339
meter square Kelvin so if you remember

439
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,589
from our table a couple slides back up H

440
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,060
equals five means we're in free

441
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,220
convection so I imagine this is gonna

442
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,660
get pretty hot because we're not blowing

443
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,850
any air over it and we're also dumping a

444
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,800
massive one watts from that again to

445
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,930
that chip that's something you

446
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,370
definitely see in a processor or like a

447
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,199
high power LED or any kind of like high

448
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,220
current driver circuit you could

449
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,139
definitely see something like that I

450
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,399
also picked T infinity at room

451
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,380
temperature ambient temperature of 23

452
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,910
degrees Celsius which is a pretty

453
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,860
average room temperature but we can

454
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,160
change that so you take all everything I

455
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,709
wrote here you add it to that or you run

456
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:23,940
it all through that resistance equation

457
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,010
we calculated on this that's Gunnar on

458
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,490
this slide and then you could do it by

459
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,300
hand I'm lazy I did it in math

460
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,160
the chip centers 113 degrees Celsius

461
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,740
that's pretty hot I mean you can check

462
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,450
the datasheet but most chips I've worked

463
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,060
with will fail at that point you drop it

464
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,100
in water and stop boiling the water so

465
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,120
let's fix it let's increase H from 5

466
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,340
watts per meter squared Kelvin to 50

467
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,810
watts per meter squared Kelvin and that

468
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,100
basically just brings us from free

469
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,960
convection where the air is not really

470
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,250
moving it's just kind of moving from the

471
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,870
heat moving through it do you force

472
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,300
convection where like maybe we stuck a

473
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,740
muffin fan in here and now we're blowing

474
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,460
air over it

475
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,290
or maybe we're sitting there blowing on

476
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,490
it to try to cool it down because

477
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,660
otherwise it's gonna melt and we're only

478
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,180
testing it for a minute and actually I

479
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,620
just mentioned time I should probably

480
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,710
should have said earlier this is all

481
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:15,350
steady-state so this is like we plug it

482
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,140
in and after five minutes 10 minutes an

483
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,880
hour however long it takes to reach its

484
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,250
full temperature that's the temperature

485
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,070
transient is you can solve for transient

486
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,780
systems to where you say like oh what is

487
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,780
it after 1 minute or 30 seconds and

488
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,340
actually we made the the analogy with

489
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,190
Ohm's law earlier where as everything is

490
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,710
kind of a resistor in steady state

491
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,040
steady state heat transfer everything in

492
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,480
transient heat transfer is pretty much a

493
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,920
capacitor it even has the thermal time

494
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,600
constant it's not exactly a capacitor

495
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,910
it's pretty close though we're not

496
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,320
that's beyond the scope of this talk but

497
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,340
it's something you can definitely do

498
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,570
anyway

499
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,040
so we're in Crete

500
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,270
oh so when you put your hand over a chip

501
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,589
on a board you can feel heat coming off

502
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,130
of it there is some radiation they're

503
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,329
working at temperatures that are low

504
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,650
enough that you you don't have a whole

505
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,380
lot of radiation it's probably probably

506
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,359
convection because especially if you if

507
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,949
you put a fan over that and it blows the

508
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:18,150
air starts moving you're not gonna feel

509
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,290
it as much but there definitely is some

510
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,270
radiation I chose to neglect it here

511
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,410
just because it's pretty minimal but

512
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,780
that's a good question anyway so we

513
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,099
moved from free convection to forced

514
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,449
convection we got a fan we're blowing

515
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:29,010
air over it now and it should be a lot

516
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,679
better it's 43 degrees Celsius now

517
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,970
that's a lot better that's within

518
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,870
workable range that's I'm okay with that

519
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,000
so let's take a look at this nice plot I

520
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,440
made because I use MATLAB I figured

521
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,640
might as well give you guys some pretty

522
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,040
pictures to look at over here on the

523
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,990
Left we have temperature and on the

524
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,070
bottom we have that heat transfer

525
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,980
coefficient so everything from 10 down

526
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,990
on the heat transfer coefficient is free

527
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,760
convection and everything from like no

528
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,980
no 10 I guess is like 10 ish up is force

529
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,140
convection we can see that adding a

530
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,760
little bit of air blowing over the chip

531
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,620
right away moving just from free to

532
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,820
force convection makes a massive

533
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,290
difference in the temperature that all

534
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,480
those temperature curves drop off and

535
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,620
what are those temperature curves those

536
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,200
are the temperature the chip with

537
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,270
different ambient temperatures so say

538
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,220
the the board we're working on has to be

539
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,920
inside a tiny enclosure and there's no

540
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,450
way we can possibly blow air over it

541
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,860
because it's inside a chunk of plastic

542
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,110
inside the robot whatever we're doing we

543
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,780
can't get to it how else can we fix this

544
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,910
we can lower the ambient temperature so

545
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,730
the bottom curve there the blue one is

546
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,010
for an ambient temperature at 0 C for

547
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,720
our chip in the in the beginning if we

548
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,970
had put it in a freezer it's at zero C

549
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,470
ambient temperature now it would only be

550
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,760
ninety degrees at the center of the ship

551
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,400
and that's that's a lot better than 113

552
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,380
so there are other things we can do

553
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,470
aside from just blowing air over it

554
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,250
obviously changing the ambient

555
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,360
temperature it's a little bit harder

556
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,800
because we have to put it in a different

557
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,600
environment or have another cooling

558
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,920
system but there are other things we can

559
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,010
do to work with it alright this is all

560
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,420
well and good these are some nice kind

561
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,429
of round numbers we picked by making a

562
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,320
lot of assumptions what if we actually

563
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,670
care about the numbers like what if we

564
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,260
really need to know the temperature the

565
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,970
center of that chip or let's let's

566
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,920
forget that example now these are both

567
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,410
simulations I've written for heat

568
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,059
transfer through aluminum plates so what

569
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,140
like what if we're doing something with

570
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,160
heat transfer when you really care

571
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,330
about the numbers and these are both

572
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,830
two-dimensional examples so we're not

573
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,690
going to do that by hand so I kind of

574
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,780
gave it away the answer is simulations

575
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,950
the one on the left here I wrote in

576
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,130
MATLAB and hot or yeah red is hot blue

577
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,530
is cold you can kind of see the left and

578
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,820
the bottom sides were held at a constant

579
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,220
hot temperature and the other two sides

580
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,690
were held at a constant cold temperature

581
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,520
and that's this is a transient

582
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,110
simulation actually this is after maybe

583
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,390
a minute what the temperature profile

584
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,090
that that board would look like the one

585
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,310
on the right I did just to prove a point

586
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,190
to a friend it's oh it's a very similar

587
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,350
simulation it's three sides being held

588
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,700
at a constant temperature instead of the

589
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,440
one it's written in the drag-and-drop

590
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,270
programming language scratch you prop

591
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,770
one of you maybe two of you may have

592
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,050
been asking hey that's cool how did you

593
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,970
do that if you're actually asking that

594
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:03,930
thinking that in your head there's

595
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,430
something very wrong with you but here's

596
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,110
how I did it

597
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,140
it's god-awful I don't recommend it if

598
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,310
you're gonna write your in numerical

599
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,900
simulations and if you want to please

600
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,150
come talk to me it's a lot of fun if

601
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,410
you're gonna write your own numerical

602
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,930
simulations do it in MATLAB do it in C++

603
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,540
he'll do it in Fortran I've done it in

604
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,760
Fortran it's kind of fun don't do it in

605
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,440
scratch this is awful this is very very

606
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,000
very bad but it works it works very well

607
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,920
the other thing you're probably thinking

608
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,540
is that's cool but I'm never gonna write

609
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,100
my own simulations and you shouldn't

610
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,590
it's fun if you want to learn it's

611
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,030
something you should definitely do I

612
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,490
spent a good time a good amount of my

613
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,530
time in college working on my bachelor's

614
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,570
and master's doing heat transfer

615
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,500
simulations and fluid simulations but

616
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,450
it's a lot of work it involves a lot of

617
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,520
like differential equations and things

618
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,170
that I'm sure you're all capable of but

619
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,580
have better things to do I know I

620
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,980
certainly have better things to do so if

621
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,330
you're gonna simulate heat transfer in a

622
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,710
chip for example I would recommend just

623
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,040
a pre-built package I've got two really

624
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,960
good recommendations for you one is one

625
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,070
you've almost definitely heard of

626
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,470
Autodesk fusion 360 it's a full CAD CAM

627
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,040
suite which even for like not does even

628
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,210
for designing things that aren't you

629
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,310
know like a simple heat transfer system

630
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,750
you can design a full mechanical

631
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,490
assembly and then run it through

632
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,080
structural or heat transfer or fluid

633
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,640
simulations it's a really really good

634
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,760
package for that it doesn't have the

635
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,990
best simulation capability

636
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,179
but it's plenty good for for what like

637
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,740
any of us would likely want to do with

638
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,160
heat transfer Sims its renew it has a

639
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,080
renewable one-year license it's free for

640
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,440
non-commercial use and it's very easy to

641
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,390
use GUI tons of tutorials and online

642
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,400
documentation it's based in the cloud

643
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,460
kind of if you care about that I don't

644
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,510
know why it's based in the cloud it's

645
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,800
kind of weird for a CAD package but it

646
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,590
works really well the other example I

647
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,870
have is open foam it's powerful it's

648
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,120
free it's open source it's a lot harder

649
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,250
to use it's based in like I ran a C++

650
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,600
framework but you can do a lot with it

651
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,330
and it's a full CFD suite CFD is

652
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,130
computational fluid dynamics and that

653
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,900
covers everything from heat transfer

654
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,120
through a solid body to actual like

655
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,309
fluids moving and interacting and mixing

656
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:13,170
there's a lot you can do with open foam

657
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,350
I've had a lot of fun working with it

658
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,980
definitely a little harder to get

659
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,330
started but once you get into it it's

660
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,130
really cool and you can also take raw

661
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,720
data out of it so just like an array of

662
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,190
numbers that represent the heat in your

663
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,870
system or the temperature in your system

664
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,630
and post process it through whatever you

665
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,800
want because you could just you just get

666
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,540
raw data which is kind of cool that's

667
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,260
something you'd like alright how do you

668
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,790
apply all of this to your projects

669
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,380
because this has been a lot of talking

670
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,480
about heat transfer and no no it's not

671
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,830
exactly the most intuitive thing in the

672
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,470
world is we've kind of discovered here

673
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,670
the first couple things we can do are

674
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,860
improved surface conduction a conduction

675
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,630
between two objects so smooth interface

676
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,460
is clean interfaces add thermal grease

677
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,920
increase surface area that all affects

678
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,360
the area term in the conduction equation

679
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,640
there and I should say it probably

680
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,990
should have mentioned earlier add

681
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,490
thermal grease is good if you have a

682
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,500
component with a large like a large

683
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,750
heatsink pad on it rather than adding

684
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,250
thermal grease between it in the board I

685
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,570
would just put a large heatsink pad on

686
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,550
the board and then solder it if you

687
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,290
don't really care about having to remove

688
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,670
it because the solder is gonna be an

689
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,170
even better joint than the heatsink or

690
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,580
than the thermal grease but if you don't

691
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,540
want to solder it you could just put a

692
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,530
bit of grease in there and it would work

693
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,130
really well too oh and yeah I mentioned

694
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,450
increased surface area yeah if you just

695
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,370
can make the surface area larger if you

696
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,020
can have two components touching in more

697
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,059
spots or in just a larger area overall

698
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,300
that's gonna make a massive difference

699
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,559
take a different material I mean you

700
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:32,790
can't really make your chips out of a

701
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,860
different material well I mean unless

702
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,970
you want to start making your own chips

703
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,240
but you certainly like for other systems

704
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,980
if you're not doing something on a

705
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,660
circuit board you

706
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,040
if you can make something out of copper

707
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,750
instead of steel copper has way better

708
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,570
at conducting heat as we learned so

709
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,000
that'll affect the K term and you

710
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,230
increase those you increase heat

711
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,060
transfer you can also shorten the

712
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,770
conduction paths reduce that length term

713
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,450
if the heat has to travel less of it

714
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,310
doesn't have to travel quite as far it's

715
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,140
gonna you're gonna connect more heat

716
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,300
through that system faster and you can

717
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,920
also throw your design in a fridge

718
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,440
decrease ambient temperature if there's

719
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,430
less of a difference between the

720
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,620
temperature then it's a lot easier to

721
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,960
work with we can also improve convection

722
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,300
as I mentioned so ad moving air and

723
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,820
create ya increase that heat transfer

724
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,810
coefficient H similar to conduction we

725
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,730
can increase surface area so add fins at

726
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,070
a heat sink that's a fantastic way and

727
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,320
actually if you can have moving air and

728
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,960
have increased surface area so like heat

729
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,790
sink with a fan on it which is a common

730
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,440
thing you've probably all seen that's a

731
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,550
very efficient way to increase

732
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,930
convection because now you have air

733
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,790
blowing over all this extra surface area

734
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,590
and you really just pull all that heat

735
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,830
away really quickly one more thing we

736
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,540
can do for convection is kind of the

737
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,830
same as conduction decrease the ambient

738
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,180
temperature if you put it in a colder

739
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,520
room that it just becomes easier to

740
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,170
bring the temperature of the chip or the

741
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,820
system or whatever down to a colder

742
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,710
temperature alright so these slides are

743
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,530
posted online again I'm Adam there's my

744
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,180
email address there's my website there's

745
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,100
my Twitter handle if you want to check

746
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,360
out these slides and download them and

747
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,830
try to do some of these examples on your

748
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,980
own you can before I finish I want to

749
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,920
try something because you might have

750
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,170
thought - Wow he wrote the heat transfer

751
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,480
simulation in MATLAB he wrote it in

752
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,670
scratch you can do it in pretty much

753
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,860
anything else what if I don't have

754
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,570
access to a computer right now and I'm

755
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,890
in the field but I really want to

756
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,280
simulate heat transfer for some reason

757
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,389
well let's see if it works

758
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,820
hey there we go

759
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:46,159
so right now it's it's simulating its

760
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,419
system it's gonna render it when it's

761
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:49,129
sewn but it has to go through a number

762
00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:51,559
of iterations to actually find the value

763
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,600
occurs the same example I showed of

764
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,340
MATLAB it's he transferred through a

765
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,350
plate with two - two sides held at

766
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,740
constant temperature

767
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:15,980
[Applause]
