started here that's next okay so why

24
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,320
indeed when I was putting this talk

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,909
together I was sitting around my house

26
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,340
and trying to think like well I want to

27
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,780
encourage you all to make weird annoying

28
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,150
things but like I found myself at kind

29
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,220
of I was I was kind of stuck I was like

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,709
well why like I hadn't honestly thought

31
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:11,440
about it like I do this but like why do

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,959
I do it like I do it because it's fun

33
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,790
but like if I'm gonna make a case for

34
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,340
all of you to do it like I need to like

35
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,860
use my words and like talk and explain

36
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,950
things so um you know for the longest

37
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,330
time like as long as I can remember I

38
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,860
have enjoyed weird things I like where

39
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,690
music I like weird clothes I like weird

40
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,500
architecture

41
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,370
I just really love weird stuff and um

42
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,739
like but why like what is it about it so

43
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,120
I thought about it some more and it was

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,680
like well I don't know that I can tell

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,450
any of you why you should make weird

46
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,070
things but I'm gonna tell you why I like

47
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,989
to make weird things and maybe you'll

48
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,640
find that you agree with some of these

49
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,959
things so um

50
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:52,760
yeah that was one of my recent projects

51
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,760
this was the Dethklok and the idea

52
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,560
behind that like this was honestly

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,909
project partially borne out of spite I

54
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:03,319
was asking people for ideas my friend

55
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,939
Roger and I Rogers here in the audience

56
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,469
we were we were doing something with his

57
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:08,209
vacuum for us and display and we wanted

58
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:10,370
to make something out of it and I asked

59
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,599
people on Twitter like what should I do

60
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,730
with it my all said make a clock and I

61
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,379
was like no there's a million vacuum

62
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:17,000
fluorescent display clocks out there but

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,040
they are all like make a clock and I was

64
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,019
like fine I'll make a clock I'm gonna

65
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,819
make a death clock so what this does is

66
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,409
when you touch the little capacitive

67
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:27,019
touch sensor it kind of reads reads you

68
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,189
and then it tells you when you're gonna

69
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:31,519
die it gives you a day at a time stuff

70
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,919
like that sets the stage for like just

71
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,480
this is like the kind of level of weird

72
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,129
stuff I work on so as I said like I

73
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:41,599
really have a good time making weird

74
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,849
stuff like it's just it's not the

75
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,709
ordinary and it really kind of like

76
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:48,019
gives me something like to kind of

77
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,680
stretch my boundaries with so you know

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,299
how like for a lot of people there comes

79
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,060
a moment in their life when they when

80
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,229
they discover something they see

81
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:59,569
something that kind of opens their

82
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,159
horizons it kind of opens their mind

83
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,810
they have like a dawning realization

84
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,699
about something that like really feels

85
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:07,609
right to them so for me that moment came

86
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:09,049
when I was 12 there was a movie that

87
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,629
came out this that year that really

88
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,280
liked it there was there was something

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,359
in that movie that really clicked with

90
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:18,858
me and I don't know if you guys you

91
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:19,940
might you might know where I'm going

92
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,690
with this yeah so uh

93
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,490
Toy Story came out in 1995 I was 12 and

94
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,440
said our good friend sit here

95
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,330
he was he was undoubtedly the villain of

96
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,820
the movie right like like the toys we're

97
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,009
trying to rescue it was woody I think

98
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:41,000
that you had woody right and like he he

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,729
turned those toys into like these mutant

100
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,229
monster toys and like maybe he was a

101
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:46,550
villain because like I there's probably

102
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,289
some consent issues involved there with

103
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,380
those poor toys but honestly like the

104
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,570
things that he made in that movie were

105
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,460
so much more interesting than anything

106
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,680
else I had seen in my life and like much

107
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,060
more interesting than anything else in

108
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,560
the movie like I like those mutant toys

109
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,390
way better than like the good toys right

110
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,970
I I can imagine right that was probably

111
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,380
their excuse to work some weird things

112
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,540
in the movie right so like there's

113
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,730
probably some kid roots for its there um

114
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,350
and they're just great like you have a

115
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,810
baby head on like a mechanical spider

116
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,480
and you have like there's there's the

117
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,220
fishing pole with the woman's legs and

118
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,600
there's like the the montt the

119
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,340
bodybuilder with the duck head like

120
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,110
they're so good like they're a mishmash

121
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,790
of parts they're made of things that

122
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,010
like don't belong together but like at

123
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,210
the same time they go really well

124
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,190
together and like you know the other

125
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,780
toys were afraid of them right like

126
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,880
these were the monsters they were scared

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,890
of them but like kind of the moral of

128
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,060
the story is that it turns out that

129
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,340
those like scary monster weird toys like

130
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,310
are their friends - right like so that's

131
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,240
the thing that I really like about

132
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,130
making weird things is like you can make

133
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,300
something really weird and really ugly

134
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,490
and really kind of like off-putting but

135
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,590
like making something with a lot of love

136
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,390
and so that like someone looks at it at

137
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,860
first and they like kind of cringe and

138
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,630
they go what did you make that for but

139
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,100
the more time they spend with it like

140
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,540
the more they start to see the charms

141
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,670
and that that's one thing that I really

142
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,080
like about making these weird things is

143
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,550
that like you can make something that

144
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,520
like on one hand like violates all kinds

145
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,930
of aesthetic sensibilities but on the

146
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,050
other hand is just so freakin cool

147
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,180
so let's go through some definitions

148
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,560
real quick I know that's boring but like

149
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,580
if I'm gonna be throwing around these

150
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,110
terms like ugly weird and annoying like

151
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,980
we should talk about definitions

152
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:30,120
definitions so ugly um yeah it's just

153
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,590
pleasing to the eye not aesthetically

154
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,420
pleasing displeasing to the ear or some

155
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,800
other sentence like okay that's pretty

156
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,080
straightforward

157
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,390
weird having an unusually strange

158
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,670
character or behavior deviating from the

159
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,070
normal bizarre let's remember that point

160
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,250
like deviating from the normal and then

161
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:53,130
annoying causing annoyance annoyance

162
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,270
that what's your nose like okay great

163
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,100
alright let's forget that okay so the

164
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,480
one thing that all of those three terms

165
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,650
have in common is that their value

166
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,840
judgments right like these are opinions

167
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,250
like someone says something is ugly

168
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,720
something someone says something is

169
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,490
annoying something says someone says

170
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,010
something is weird like that's their

171
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,390
judgement of that thing but they're just

172
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,900
opinions they're aesthetic

173
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,419
princess-like what one person thinks is

174
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,009
ugly you might be really beautiful to

175
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,770
someone else and like if you have

176
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,810
different experiences from someone what

177
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,250
you think is normal might be different

178
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,810
than what someone else thinks is normal

179
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,199
right

180
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,900
and even like something that's annoying

181
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,460
it might be annoying to you at one time

182
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,039
of the day and like great at another

183
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,479
time of the day like if it's a hot day

184
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:38,560
and it's afternoon you heard the

185
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,330
ice-cream man like yeah like it's

186
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,070
ice-cream man right but if it's like

187
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,060
2:00 in the morning in the ice cream

188
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,110
man's parked out of your house like

189
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,889
that's the worst so yeah so it's all

190
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,260
contextual it's like what is the context

191
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,750
in which you're observing these things

192
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,550
experiencing these things and that's

193
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,900
another thing I really like about making

194
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,760
things that are weird there's like

195
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,010
there's a context to all of it and and

196
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,919
and it changes for people all the time

197
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,440
it's fluid and it's dynamic and there's

198
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,060
a really great quote by this composer

199
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,949
named John Cage that touches on this

200
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:12,610
point and so he says the first question

201
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,229
I asked myself when something doesn't

202
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:17,139
seem to be beautiful is why I do why I

203
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,490
do not think it's beautiful

204
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,650
and very shortly you discover that there

205
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,050
is no reason and that's that's really

206
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,539
true like we a lot of times like it's

207
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,770
the old saying like don't judge a book

208
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,490
by it's cover

209
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,139
and like we immediately make a value

210
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:30,580
judgment about things when we see them

211
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,500
but like if we take time to experience

212
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,360
them and like observe them and interact

213
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,789
with them like our experience can change

214
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,650
and like the way we value them can

215
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,049
change and you know that that really

216
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,820
that's another point that really like

217
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,680
gets to the heart of what I like about

218
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,720
making weird ugly and annoying things is

219
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,450
that like we can we can change that for

220
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,250
people and what he's saying is like you

221
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,150
know you know think critically about

222
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,880
what you're looking at and like

223
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,050
experience it for what it is don't just

224
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,880
like rely on your first judgments and

225
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,740
because you know you might be missing

226
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,880
out on something that you could

227
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,310
otherwise be enjoying you know if you

228
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,930
just say like oh well that thing is

229
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,910
awful and then you just want to walk

230
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,800
away like you might be missing out on

231
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,740
something so like what I want to do with

232
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,990
making weird things is like letting

233
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,810
people experience these things and and

234
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,260
and reassess what it what weird is to

235
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,839
that reassess what is nour abnormal to

236
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:29,200
them

237
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,640
reassess like what is this that

238
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,630
we pleasing to them so you know

239
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,070
sometimes when I made something well not

240
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,420
sometimes like always when I made

241
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,470
something and I show them to someone

242
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,560
like they always like they there's a

243
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,840
reaction like usually it's like well why

244
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,250
why did you make that what is that

245
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,320
supposed to do it's off-putting and so

246
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,870
one of these projects here this is my

247
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,320
circumvent noise box after I made this I

248
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,790
took it over to my parents house when I

249
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,010
went for a visit because I have a

250
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,470
gratuitous need for affirming approval

251
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,560
and so so I took it over there to show

252
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,830
my parents because I'm not 36 years old

253
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,880
and like my own person right so I took

254
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,260
it over and I turned it on for them and

255
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,630
my dad rolled his eyes and he groaned

256
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,880
and it's like oh god what is em doing

257
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,330
now like what is that awful thing but I

258
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,840
handed it to him and I told him to try

259
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,790
this thing out and so he did and he took

260
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,780
it and he started pressing some of the

261
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,080
buttons

262
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,220
[Music]

263
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,269
and he started twisting some of the

264
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:45,170
knobs and then he started pressing the

265
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:51,230
body contact points and like the noises

266
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,079
he were making were just terrible to

267
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,829
everyone else right

268
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,440
he had hated the box until I gave it to

269
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,230
him to try and like it became a thing

270
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,180
for him to control and a thing for him

271
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,800
to play with and you know what like five

272
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
minutes later he was still playing with

273
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,709
that box and he was annoying the hell

274
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:12,110
out of everyone else in the family but

275
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,220
you know I he was sitting there on his

276
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,990
recliner and he was laughing he was like

277
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,019
just totally into this box and just five

278
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,279
minutes before he had just thought it

279
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,690
was the worst thing he had ever seen and

280
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,529
he was totally into it and that's that's

281
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:25,730
what I mean when I like to talk about

282
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,130
context is that like if you can change

283
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,890
the context for people then you can

284
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,070
change their experience the thing that

285
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,810
like was so annoying had become fun for

286
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,529
him and I make weird things because I

287
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:40,970
want other people to enjoy weird things

288
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,470
as much as I do I want to share that

289
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,390
with people like I don't know what it

290
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,610
what it is about like the way I formed

291
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,560
as a child that said like I'm gonna like

292
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,690
weird things but like I get such joy out

293
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,890
of weird things and I really want other

294
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,390
people to be able to experience that

295
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,120
with me too and I think that's maybe

296
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,010
becoming a little bit harder these days

297
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,810
because we live in a world that is like

298
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,690
so much is polished by like Biden design

299
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,490
committees and polished by focus groups

300
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,380
and by marketing teams and strategies

301
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,930
and like the things that exist in the

302
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,459
world around us like all of our products

303
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:11,720
they're polished and polished and

304
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,029
polished like rough edges get smoothed

305
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:16,880
down like weird things get sounded off

306
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,880
like everything is made to be

307
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,010
inoffensive to the senses before it

308
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,029
leaves the drawing board

309
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:27,520
right well most of the time right like

310
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,839
don't look at am i who don't look at an

311
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,240
eye so um who here remembers Calvin and

312
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,490
Hobbes can I give show hands okay so I

313
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,110
had to joke about being an old

314
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,430
millennial but I'm not I guess I'm not

315
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,130
that old so yeah there was this this

316
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,829
strip there was a whole series right and

317
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:47,690
and it was like a like a side plot and

318
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,360
Calvin and Hobbes go digging for fossils

319
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,559
and they just got to the woods and they

320
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,740
dag and all that they ended up finding

321
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,819
is a bunch of like rusty cans and like

322
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:02,120
old cups and like a coke bottle and some

323
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,699
old silverware but like Calvin is

324
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,680
convinced that like they're gonna go out

325
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,019
there and find fossils and so like to

326
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:11,240
him those are fossils they're not trash

327
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,279
they're fossils and he takes them back

328
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,529
to his house and he's convinced they're

329
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,029
a dinosaur so he assembles them into

330
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,490
this dinosaur and like he's given them a

331
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,579
new narrative and like you see here like

332
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:24,019
Hobbs draws it for him and it's it's a

333
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:26,779
weird like kissing dinosaur but like

334
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:29,839
that that is the essence of like what is

335
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,850
great about making weird things is that

336
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,459
you can take things that don't belong

337
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,230
together and put them together and you

338
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,910
give them a new context and give them a

339
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,980
new narrative and like that's not trash

340
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,910
anymore right

341
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,079
like that was just trash that was

342
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,209
littering the forest and now to him it's

343
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:45,920
a dinosaur skeleton like he has

344
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,230
transformed those things into something

345
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,680
else and I love that because like that's

346
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,769
what I work like the things that I make

347
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:58,100
I make them out of stuff I find you know

348
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,740
I have I have like these bird skulls

349
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,019
here like these I found on a beach in

350
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,759
Northern California with with the bird

351
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,889
still attached they were not alive at

352
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:10,490
the time okay so but like I can take

353
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,220
like parts of animals that like have

354
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,470
deceased I can take old cigar boxes I

355
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,990
can take out funnel I can take another

356
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,660
like wooden box hiding inside of here is

357
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,339
like some cheap children's toy I found

358
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:25,100
at the thrift store this is another

359
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,439
cigar box this is a knob I found it at a

360
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:28,730
at a scrapyard

361
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,319
there's a piece of metal here that I

362
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,480
found on the side of the road like I can

363
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,949
take all these things that I just find

364
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:35,569
out in the world and like transform them

365
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,360
into something new and like I give them

366
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,009
new life and they're not ending up in

367
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:43,160
the landfill there and and not only are

368
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,449
they not ending up in the landfill

369
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:46,490
they're like taking on new meaning and I

370
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,629
think that's really cool

371
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:50,480
because you know a lot of times when you

372
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,309
work on a project you can start with raw

373
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,660
materials you can go to the store you

374
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,610
can buy wood you can buy like angle iron

375
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,589
you can buy glass and you can make your

376
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:59,929
project exactly the way you wanted it to

377
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:02,449
be you can have a vision in your head

378
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:03,960
and you can create that

379
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,550
exact thing which is a good feeling like

380
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,410
don't get me wrong but when you work

381
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,230
with materials that you find you have to

382
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,180
let the materials partially direct your

383
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,220
creative process like they join you

384
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,420
they're part of like this design

385
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,430
committee and so like you might have an

386
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,930
idea about what you want your project to

387
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,450
be but then you take ugly weird and

388
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,040
things that you found out in the woods

389
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,540
or on the side of the street like

390
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,520
literally these joists these buttons

391
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,200
these arcade buttons some went through

392
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,970
an arcade machine out of their truck

393
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,100
next to my house and it exploded on the

394
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,830
road and it got run over by cars and I

395
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,350
took as many parts off of it as I could

396
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,120
but when you do that like you're

397
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,090
allowing your project to go places you

398
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,250
didn't expect maybe and honestly like

399
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,170
most of my projects like I have an idea

400
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,430
but then I start working with my

401
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,200
materials and then they end up going

402
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,940
someplace that I didn't expect and

403
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,130
usually they end up weirder than I

404
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,510
thought they were gonna be and that's

405
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,310
really refreshing because it's kind of a

406
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,380
surprise it makes you work your creative

407
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,610
muscles a little bit more to work with

408
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,560
the materials you have and then you end

409
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,910
up with something that not even you're

410
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,890
expecting to see and that is such a fun

411
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:11,340
feeling so in conclusion like there's

412
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,140
nothing wrong with normal but there's

413
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,730
nothing inherently right about normal

414
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,150
either

415
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,680
and when we would decide that one thing

416
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,950
is normal and another thing is abnormal

417
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,900
we're setting limits on ourselves we're

418
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,190
saying like these are the things that

419
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,720
are okay and these are the things that

420
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,280
are not and I don't think we should be

421
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,830
limiting ourselves you know like you

422
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,480
don't want it like why put all those

423
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,160
things like in the closet and say like

424
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,250
those are not okay like no like there's

425
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,740
a lot of stuff in the world that like is

426
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,990
overlooked and is forgotten and like

427
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,180
that no one wants but those things are

428
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,920
wonderful for making your projects and

429
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,450
they will bring such like a different

430
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,000
flavor to your projects

431
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,470
we live in this world with this pressure

432
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,720
that everyone experiences to be normal

433
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,250
like that's like if you've been through

434
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,830
junior high like you felt that like like

435
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,050
don't do anything weird because like

436
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,000
you're gonna be the outcast you know

437
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,530
wear normal clothes like get a normal

438
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,630
job like go to normal places and have

439
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,640
normal hobbies but that's very limiting

440
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,440
and I don't want you to be limited

441
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,910
because you you're all creative people

442
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,150
you're here you're creative and I want

443
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,800
you to be able to like stretch your

444
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,819
creative abilities

445
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,819
as far as they can go so like next time

446
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,109
you think about something and you think

447
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,369
like well that's weird

448
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,260
like you see something and think that's

449
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,849
weird like ask yourself why is it weird

450
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,340
and ask yourself if it's really weird

451
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,010
like what makes it feel weird to you and

452
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,860
maybe you'll find that that weird thing

453
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,300
isn't so weird after all and maybe

454
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,130
you'll find that you'll find some

455
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,560
weirdness in your own life to enjoy so

456
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,220
thank you
