00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,090
[Applause]

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,560
thank you thanks everybody

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,769
I might this is Kate we have two

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,330
microphones so we get to argue with each

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,920
other the whole time it's great not

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,369
tethered hey we agreed on something Kate

7
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,340
introduce yourself so I'm can I do

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,680
software stuff at Great Scott gadgets

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,539
supposedly which means I mostly do

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,969
Hardware things but I supposedly

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,100
software I've done hardware for the past

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,719
six or seven weeks which means I'm not

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,940
doing my job I much prefer to talk about

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,739
the cool things you can do instead of

15
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,770
the things that I do so my job is to

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,550
make it so that you can do cool things

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,800
Mike and I'm the founder of great

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,660
gadgets and the designer of all the

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,000
hardware that we sell although that is

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,280
changing and I've really a big big part

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,500
of like my background before I started

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,090
Great Scott gadgets was I was super into

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,559
software-defined radio and I was already

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,270
teaching classes on software-defined

25
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,869
radio and that was a big part of you

26
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,610
know what we do at Gray's got gadgets is

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,740
like building tools to support education

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,250
and so I'm really enthusiastic about

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,409
software-defined radio and all the

30
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,439
things that we can do with SDR and that

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,970
was kind of some of the background

32
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,920
behind this and Kate's into that stuff

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,340
too so you know software-defined radio

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,009
is one example of software-defined

35
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,650
things we also have kind of all sorts of

36
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,729
weird stuff like software-defined

37
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,860
networking happening now and it's sort

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,390
of in general it's a software-defined

39
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,740
thing is specialized stuff made without

40
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,450
specialized hardware or specialized

41
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,299
software right this name kind of comes

42
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,000
from from our perspective from a very

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,399
specific technology which was kind of

44
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:54,390
the introduction to software-defined

45
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,960
radio yeah yes which is software-defined

46
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,259
radio and and specifically where we're

47
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,479
kind of taking our title for this talk

48
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,189
from software-defined radio not from

49
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,960
things like software-defined networking

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,758
in software-defined radio we

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,150
specifically have this sort of sampling

52
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,870
of a real

53
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,330
world signal and then processing a

54
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,720
waveform in the digital land doing

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,640
digital signal processing and then being

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,659
able to like spit that signal out and my

57
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,120
HDMI just dropped that's exciting and so

58
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,690
what you would be seeing if we had video

59
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,530
right now is a picture is a picture of

60
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,790
pack r1 which is just one example of a

61
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,200
software defined radio platform we

62
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,090
happen to like it because like I

63
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:57,329
designed it but but okay so but really

64
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,530
we're not talking about self reply radio

65
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,079
is just an example of the kind of thing

66
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:04,409
that inspired this talk is truly

67
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,620
actually I kind of take issue with this

68
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,480
slide because because so we're gonna

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,609
start arguing already because

70
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,290
technically a software defined radio

71
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,780
actually is something is a radio that's

72
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,790
built out of software and it may have a

73
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,919
hardware component like this platform

74
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,319
this peripheral called hack our app but

75
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,290
the the essential elements of what make

76
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,560
this make a raid the radio like function

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,900
as a particular type of device like

78
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,150
function as your garage door opener it's

79
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,500
actually software running on the

80
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,930
computer connected to this thing so the

81
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,239
hack RF or whatever other software

82
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,280
defined radio platform you use is a

83
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,290
component in a software-defined radio

84
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,269
but the thing that makes it software to

85
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,549
find is the software not the hardware

86
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,440
right if you go to the next slide the

87
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,569
really cool thing that has come from the

88
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,549
software-defined radio movement is not

89
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,040
even the broad variety of software

90
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,680
defined radio hardware but the software

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,480
that supports it and I don't call it

92
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
Harvard defined radio but this software

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,280
especially in your radio and especially

94
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,769
in your radio companion is software that

95
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,019
allows you to do advanced digital signal

96
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,510
processing things in a really easy

97
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,840
visual GUI based language which means

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,639
that you can actually model data flow as

99
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,310
things that look like data flow you

100
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,659
don't have to know how to program

101
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:24,210
software to do things that are DSP you

102
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,620
don't even have to know that it's DSP in

103
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,130
order to do

104
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,140
Espie right so we're gonna show you

105
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,230
today a bunch of things that are kind of

106
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,860
in very atypical use cases that are

107
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,420
enabled by the stuff that was built for

108
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,730
software-defined radio and we've

109
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,680
actually used other tools besides good

110
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,900
new radio for this kind of stuff but

111
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,310
today we're just gonna do a bunch of

112
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,630
demos in Guinea radio because we think

113
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,510
it's the most compelling piece you know

114
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,790
single piece of software that is a huge

115
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,470
tool kit that allows a whole bunch of

116
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,360
different things so we're gonna start

117
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,470
with a demo that is using do it should I

118
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,480
do a thing should I do it should I

119
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,270
advance the slides or should this and

120
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,880
start you want to start that we can talk

121
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,560
about it and then we can go into the

122
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,560
okay I'm gonna figure out this is gonna

123
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,850
be that's the one right sure okay so

124
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,950
what we are gonna do now is we have here

125
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,900
sitting on the table a light sensor will

126
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,700
show you a picture of in a minute and

127
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,400
we're just capturing the essentially the

128
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,290
signal that is coming from that using a

129
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,320
great fat analog output here dumped

130
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,930
right onto your screen and it's not very

131
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,580
interesting looking because the ambient

132
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,290
light level in here is pretty steady

133
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,360
however if you look really really

134
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,500
closely you might notice it just

135
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
wiggling up and down a little bit and

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,350
one of the cool things that good new

137
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,970
video lets us do is instead of doing

138
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,410
this time domain display like an

139
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,790
oscilloscope it lets us do a frequency

140
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,250
domain display like a spectrum analyzer

141
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,140
and you see there's this big DC spike in

142
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,250
the middle which we can kind of ignore

143
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,870
but then you see this interesting thing

144
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,050
over here at 120 Hertz that's actually

145
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,270
the modulation of the light sources that

146
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,010
are in this room and can we get the

147
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,840
lights dimmed for a moment watch this

148
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,110
peak under my mouse cursor here maybe

149
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,580
we'll see something interesting happen

150
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,970
oh that's crazy yeah it went up this is

151
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,550
an automatically scaled sensor those LED

152
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,500
lights don't operate at 60 Hertz yeah

153
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,240
none of the others I think over here so

154
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,920
now we're picking up more of the 60

155
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,140
Hertz because it's not getting drowned

156
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,590
out by the Bible however these lights

157
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,120
are pulsed me said a 120 Hertz or point

158
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,310
1 2 kilohertz because they have a 60

159
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,080
Hertz that is an upswing and a downswing

160
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,450
so we're getting twice that here do you

161
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,800
want to turn on that that's really cool

162
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,400
yeah

163
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,900
yeah yeah so what we have here is a

164
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,000
small spinning light as you might see on

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,400
a variety of vehicles that may or may

166
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,060
not be harassing you at the time and so

167
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,949
kind of an interesting thought is we

168
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:54,810
have this light sensor and this light

169
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,419
sensor is something that is something

170
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,860
you do some analysis on in the time

171
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,919
domain if we point it at this we can

172
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,190
even kind of see look at this we can

173
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,570
come to see those pulses there as this

174
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,550
thing spends it kind of makes sense if

175
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,139
you see that thing physically spinning

176
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,600
it's actually just a little light bulb

177
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,250
that's being blocked by a piece of

178
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,669
reflective metal periodically and in the

179
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:19,320
time domain we can kind of see on this

180
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,910
graph that sometimes of lights not there

181
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,770
but if we switch to the frequency domain

182
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,680
what you can actually see if you zoom in

183
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,169
there it's really close to the center

184
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,090
remember to zoom out a little more

185
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,179
[Music]

186
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,870
actually seeing is a frequency domain

187
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,820
analysis of all of the light in the room

188
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,710
right now including that spinning light

189
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,870
so if you want to detect someone who has

190
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,660
one of these flashing lights you can

191
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,389
build something that has a simple

192
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,099
frequency domain analysis and tells you

193
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,870
if something is spinning at about those

194
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,990
two Hertz those two cycles per second so

195
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,490
if you want to know if someone is now

196
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,740
coming to harass you with a spinning

197
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,280
light you can actually go and take your

198
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,810
light sensor pointed out your window and

199
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,210
see yes okay we have a spinning blue

200
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,680
light here that's spinning at about the

201
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,289
frequency we expect and it took awhile

202
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:21,840
to update because I set the FFT size so

203
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,370
high and my sample rate is fairly low

204
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,979
but you can now see that all those Peaks

205
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,400
that were detected from of the rate of

206
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,930
rotation of this thing have dropped out

207
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,479
but it's down a really cool thing that

208
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,330
we experimented with in a lab is if we

209
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,708
had more than one of these lights which

210
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,330
we should have had Amazon actually

211
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,429
delivered a second one yeah Amazon lied

212
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,229
to us but we were supposed to have

213
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:44,820
another one of these delivered to the

214
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,180
hotel yesterday as you

215
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,540
add more lights the interference present

216
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,950
between the lights as they are all

217
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,140
slightly a not synchronize with each

218
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,880
other actually tells you how many of

219
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,430
them there are so if you have like four

220
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,170
of these you can actually see a little

221
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,230
shift in the frequency domain as that

222
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,210
little tiny lobe you have of that moves

223
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,670
over and looking at the shape of that

224
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,230
you can actually say it seems like

225
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,620
there's like four of these yeah and in

226
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,080
theory you could even pinpoint like the

227
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,110
precise frequency of one versus another

228
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,300
however since their frequency of

229
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,220
rotation is so slow it's like two Hertz

230
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,490
like you know coming up with subtle

231
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,340
differences kind of requires a fairly

232
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,940
long-lived capture but it is possible

233
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,630
and so we move on oh this is actually

234
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,090
the picture of the light sensors we just

235
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,100
used and so the platform we're using to

236
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,000
do this demo is great fat one which is a

237
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,150
thing that we make that is a sort of an

238
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,190
embedded development platform with a

239
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,530
slightly different model instead of

240
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,390
doing embedded development where you're

241
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,190
like writing firmware for the thing we

242
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,290
try to support peripheral development

243
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,000
where you're you're plugging the thing

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,600
in and it exposes all these outside

245
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,640
connections to Python on your host

246
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,030
computer and and so we're using that for

247
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,530
rapid development here and I've made

248
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,540
this little add-on board called a

249
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,720
neighbor or sania so there's a neighbor

250
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,120
Orsini is on top and it's a grove base

251
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,370
this is a new neighbor that I just

252
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,050
designed recently and it's just a

253
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,610
convenient way for us to plug in a bunch

254
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,350
of external things and one of those

255
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,670
external things that we're using right

256
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,100
now is this little light sensor that

257
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,080
Kate had in her drawer and came from

258
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,470
Adafruit a little commercial sensor that

259
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,170
was made by and made for makers it costs

260
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,510
like $3 it is not at all a specialized

261
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,000
sensor we had it around I plugged it

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,560
into this and without doing too much

263
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,330
more we were able to take that data and

264
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,480
plop it into any radio you know and that

265
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,800
enabled us to do things like that

266
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,300
frequency domain analysis is that

267
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,800
there no I don't see the flow oh here's

268
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,600
that's the next flow chart oh we don't

269
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,670
have that flow graph that's right

270
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,580
there's only two blocks in it but if you

271
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,500
want to look at it again it's kind of

272
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,570
hard to see because of the font size but

273
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,860
there's really only two blocks this one

274
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,060
that I'm wiggling around and this one

275
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,320
that I'm wearing a look around right so

276
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,090
we added the capability to grab things

277
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,100
from great fat that's one block there

278
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,470
this is just a source that dumps data

279
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,900
from the grave that's a DC into Canoe

280
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,220
radio and all we're doing there is

281
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,800
visualizing that so we actually get all

282
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,180
of that data that's coming in from the

283
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,870
ADC piped into this DSP system for free

284
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,670
and then any analysis you're gonna do

285
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,620
you can do in software at that point

286
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,750
using this kind of flow graph metaphor

287
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,860
that GRC Wiener radio companion provides

288
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,390
but we can we can sample things other

289
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,660
than the ATS using the ADC we can also

290
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,280
interface with all sorts of digital

291
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:50,830
things so let me fire up our next demo

292
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,940
which is a slightly more complicated

293
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,910
flow graph that is bringing in some data

294
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,820
from this touch sensor which is an I

295
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,480
squared C device so we're still just a

296
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,340
little simple device plugged in through

297
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,160
the great set but this time instead of

298
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,310
sampling an analog signal we're asking

299
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,010
the the I squared C device for

300
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,940
information periodically should run it

301
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,160
and in this case we're using audio

302
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,260
output so you know you might need to

303
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,670
cover your ears we'll see how loud this

304
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,490
is not very loud okay I'm gonna turn up

305
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,320
the volume there we go can you hear that

306
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,170
so this is the most basic way of kind of

307
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,500
making this visualization into something

308
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,200
that we can hear if you want to you can

309
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,690
take sensors and produce crazy musical

310
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,660
things using the radio because it is a

311
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,750
general signal processing toolkit so in

312
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,330
this case we're just driving a frequency

313
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,650
in this case it's like an FM modulator

314
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,290
based on the position but the really

315
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,870
cool thing is you're actually getting a

316
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,730
purely digital signal listen there's no

317
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,040
analog thing here that's sitting in a

318
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,750
sensor that's accessed via I squared C

319
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,760
so it's a sensor you usually talk to

320
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,330
digitally

321
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,910
we are taking that grabbing data from

322
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,529
that sensor and dumping it into a new

323
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,420
radio so you can do signal processing

324
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,050
with it and so we have this kind of zoom

325
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,730
in on our flow graph here maybe you can

326
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,279
actually read this one and so you can

327
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,930
see on the Left we have we have an I

328
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,390
squared C register source there which is

329
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,420
a new block that K wrote for a new radio

330
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,250
and it's an astonishingly small amount

331
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,640
of code entirely in Python we're using

332
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,370
goony radio 3 8 because 3 8 which is

333
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,519
brand new supports Python 3 finally yay

334
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,100
and we like Python 3 and we're just

335
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,899
about ready to kick Python 2 out the

336
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:40,260
door

337
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,610
and we're and so she'd made like this a

338
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,070
DC block and she made this I - C block

339
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,250
we can make other blocks and each one is

340
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,250
like a really small amount of code right

341
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,420
and so all this is doing is grabbing

342
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,260
that taking it and stretching basically

343
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,610
adding samples at the point where it's

344
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,560
at the same frequency as the speakers

345
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,980
and then frequency modulating it and

346
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,000
outputting it there so you get a

347
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,649
essentially a sine wave whose frequency

348
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:11,040
varies with your position on this

349
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,440
digital slider right and so we can play

350
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,529
with with doing like things with high

351
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:19,800
speed data streams if we want to or and

352
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,120
we can play with all kinds of digital

353
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,740
signal processing things we can also

354
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,649
play with actuators we're only showing

355
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:28,320
sources not sinks so we're showing data

356
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,990
getting pumped by the great fit into the

357
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,700
new radio we can do the same thing in

358
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,290
Reverse but we're not doing that because

359
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,720
we only have so much time today and so

360
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,230
our actuator for today is a audio output

361
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,029
right which is a little bit nicer people

362
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,310
are listening to recordings of this who

363
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,600
can actually see the stuff we're doing

364
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,140
good point

365
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,750
so we planned that and this is not the

366
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,660
only sensor we can work with yeah we

367
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,640
have other sensors like I was playing

368
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,279
with this accelerometer not too long ago

369
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,910
and Anna and I was trying to get it

370
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,170
working with a great bet and I started

371
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,490
getting it working with a great bed and

372
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,860
and actually before I even had Kate's

373
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,079
fancy block to bring it into a new radio

374
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,329
I was noticing that hey this thing can

375
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:12,029
sample pretty fast and like even just

376
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,040
naively even just like one line of

377
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,550
Python from my host committee

378
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,920
just saying give me a reading it gave me

379
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,810
a reading and then I'm like okay put

380
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,940
that in a for loop and give me like

381
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,160
10,000 readings and I got like like

382
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,020
3,000 samples per second just like

383
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,550
naively doing that without even like

384
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,370
running anything in firmware or or using

385
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,900
any of Kate's code that's doing it the

386
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,660
right way and so just doing it the wrong

387
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,150
way I was like hey like 3,000 samples

388
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,730
per second I I bet I bet I could get

389
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,300
some audio and so so I apologized to

390
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,230
people who are nearby at the time I

391
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,460
started sampling the thing and I leaned

392
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,160
over and just like an inch away from it

393
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,320
just shouted at the top of my lungs and

394
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,400
I actually got almost intelligible audio

395
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,860
and I was like I was so excited I was

396
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,000
like look at around the lab for

397
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,670
something to like make it better so that

398
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,020
you know turning this thing into a

399
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,470
microphone

400
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,960
and and I was like I found this party

401
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,150
balloon and I took this mylar party

402
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,880
balloon and I and I got the packing tape

403
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,040
from the warehouse and I just like tape

404
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,260
the thing this dev board onto the

405
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,240
balloon and I started yelling at it and

406
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,980
I actually did get intelligible audio I

407
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,060
you can hear me say like 1 2 3 and I the

408
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,300
balloon lasted for exactly one test sir

409
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,880
turns out you should desolder the pin

410
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,250
headers before you tape the thing

411
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,940
excitedly onto the balloon but it did

412
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,530
last for one test which was super

413
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,400
awesome yeah and so we're just

414
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,080
collaborating at this point I think over

415
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,090
IRC oh yeah we were on IRC and I was I

416
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,200
was like giving her the play-by-play

417
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,720
like hey I can yell at it and I can hear

418
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,280
my voice and she's like we should

419
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,750
totally use this as a musical instrument

420
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,960
pickup and I was like hey I have this

421
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,480
toy guitar and but now they can at least

422
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,830
say that mike has yelled at a balloon

423
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,480
until it popped so that's something that

424
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,720
I cherish from this yeah like this is

425
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,430
totally not the first time in my life I

426
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,790
have shouted at electronics but it may

427
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,869
have been the first time I had the

428
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,319
intended effect

429
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,829
so I've taken the same accelerometer

430
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,579
board with the pin headers removed and

431
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,150
added this I to see cable and we just

432
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,459
need to plug it in I don't think I've

433
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,020
tested this port before we'll find out

434
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:34,379
if it works did I make the ear senior oh

435
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,150
so this is what it looks like close up

436
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,880
just like posing near my guitar but I

437
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,400
have it strapped on near the bridge kind

438
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,100
of about where it is in this photo and

439
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,970
so I should be able to run a flow graph

440
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,440
here now this is gonna be really

441
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,990
interesting because we have no idea what

442
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,160
this is gonna do with the sound system

443
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,010
inherits this is great I'm super excited

444
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,880
[Music]

445
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,669
guitar okay so I've made this little

446
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,230
flow graph that kind of emulates a

447
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,120
guitar amplifier which keeps getting

448
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,799
more complicated every time I play with

449
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,770
it last night and it was just basically

450
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,630
audio with a little bit of clipping and

451
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,370
there as we went through this who's just

452
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,020
getting more and more so as we were just

453
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,360
sitting there getting oh I don't think

454
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,750
I'm getting data Oh No

455
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,660
it's just respect great bet yeah yeah oh

456
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,700
yeah you we were going to restart the

457
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,630
great back weren't we

458
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,720
we forgot there might be we might have

459
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,240
bugs it's possible I at this point

460
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,770
ironically restart everything before I

461
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,180
start any demo because I don't trust

462
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,720
their ego okay so if I turn up the

463
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,790
volume to 11 or something can you hear

464
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,890
that like through the speakers is that

465
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,830
coming out can we get a little more

466
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,610
volume maybe I can I can I can do my

467
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,520
also mixer I can turn that up oh there

468
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:05,900
we go

469
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,320
maybe yeah I should hear some there we

470
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,760
go okay now it's a little nasty sounding

471
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,250
oh oh there we go there we go I'm

472
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,330
actually gonna turn this down a little

473
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,440
bit I'm probably a little far into the

474
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,500
red there but that's that's pretty good

475
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,900
but like I should be able can we get it

476
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,520
adjusted so like you can hear it now

477
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,230
[Music]

478
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,420
okay so it doesn't sound great right I'm

479
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,370
only sampling at 6000 samples per second

480
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,530
which means like I'm not getting much

481
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,870
high-frequency content but like there's

482
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,760
this time-honored tradition among

483
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,130
electric guitarists to introduce high

484
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,160
frequency content in the form of the

485
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,370
stories in form of clipping so I'm going

486
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,350
to turn out my preamp here instead of my

487
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,640
post and like see if we can get

488
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,490
right all right this calls for our great

489
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,290

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,600
[Music]

494
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,130
in this

495
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,689
[Music]

496
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,819
[Applause]

497
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,330
all right so we're sitting there in the

498
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,400
hotel last night kind of grinning at

499
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,060
this yeah

500
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,100
and we decided that simple clipping

501
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,960
wasn't enough of that electric guitar

502
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,180
sound yeah and so we were sitting there

503
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:19,490
like just we're radio instead of like

504
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,170
these two block these two blocks down at

505
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,030
the bottom right here are just adding a

506
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,970
little reverb which isn't like in the

507
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,830
most naive way we could possibly think

508
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,389
of and it just it kind of sounded good

509
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,549
[Music]

510
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,609
[Music]

511
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,950
so like hey I'm just gonna wear that

512
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,870
because I'm just I'm just gonna break it

513
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,010
if I take it off if you if you go

514
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,180
through this flow graph a little bit I

515
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,220
think I have a slide for this right do

516
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,690
we have a slide for this do I know how

517
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,250
to use my laptop there we go

518
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,980
so without the reverb it's really pretty

519
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,560
simple like I was kind of amazed that it

520
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,930
did not take much to model an electric

521
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,540
guitar amp in canoe radio and like make

522
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,600
it fun to play because it's super fun to

523
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,020
play so we have this i2c register source

524
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,940
like the same thing same exact source we

525
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,130
use for this little touch slider and

526
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,870
then we're just like blocking the DC

527
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,360
component which is like the fixed like

528
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,730
mostly gravity probably like that it's

529
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,820
affecting the sensor and and then

530
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,200
visualizing it in the frequency domain

531
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,540
that's over on the right-hand side and

532
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,070
then we're just resampling it so we're

533
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,950
changing it from the six ish killer

534
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,660
samples per second up to 48 killer

535
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,980
samples per second which is when my

536
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,350
sound card runs out and then all I'm

537
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,540
doing is multiplying the the signal

538
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,090
value just scaling it up according to my

539
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,970
preamp slider and then reeling it like

540
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,090
clipping it at plus 1 or minus 1 and

541
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,430
then scaling it up again according to my

542
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,020
post gain slider and then dumping it

543
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,000
into the sound card that was it so that

544
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,450
is all we're doing using descriptions

545
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,130
like how to build things like clipping

546
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,930
circuits that's one block in your radio

547
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:16,470
yeah and so just to show you again kind

548
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,190
of what this what this looks like the

549
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,000
clipping if you look at this waveform

550
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,250
the time domain waveform across the

551
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,360
middle of screen you see how there's the

552
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,370
blue curve and the red curve the blue

553
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,750
curve is showing like what the signal

554
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,130
would be doing if it weren't clipping

555
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,140
and the red signal is showing the actual

556
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,150
clip signal it turns it into square

557
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,250
waves it adds a bunch of higher

558
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,560
frequency components and makes the

559
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,800
wonderful ridiculous distortion that we

560
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,000
all love so if we have the time I don't

561
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,340
know if we do you want

562
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,130
one more thing this is oh yeah yeah yeah

563
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,900
yeah one of the cool things is that like

564
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,060
yeah we should just keep this running

565
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,890
one of the cool things is that I was

566
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,020
like oh I need some fancy way to attach

567
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,760
it to my guitar and Kate was like just

568
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,010
strap it on with a rubber band and it

569
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,660
totally worked but it's sort of

570
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,720
interesting because like can we get

571
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,970
audio again can you play that for us

572
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,660
okay

573
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,140
so like we can totally play the guitar

574
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:25,220
or or we can play rubber band

575
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,330
so in the spirit of Software Defined

576
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,820
everything just before our talk we found

577
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:41,910
in everything we have not tried this box

578
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,570
we tried other boxes

579
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,300
yeah well I'm doing a little bit

580
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,550
experimentation here so we were taking

581
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,990
an accelerometer and strapping it to a

582
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,870
cardboard box here and this is not the

583
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,340
craziest part of our talk is it not well

584
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,179
we'll see okay

585
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:19,320
[Music]

586
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,260
three little stepping on that

587
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,240
[Applause]

588
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,020
nothing in this demo has been anything

589
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,170
more than sensors and actuators dumped

590
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,690
into good new radio but so this is all

591
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,630
stuff that is just regular viable

592
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,850
commercial accelerometers by sensors

593
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,440
things like that we are taking all this

594
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,150
stuff and doing all of the magic in

595
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,420
software yeah and and we're not the

596
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,400
first person people to do that like

597
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,680
making a pickle instrument pickup out of

598
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,150
an accelerometer this is actually this

599
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,870
cool post by analog devices they did it

600
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,400
much better than we did

601
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,920
like notably they made it at a much

602
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,650
higher sample rate which is cool but we

603
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,600
did at a sample rate that's fun so it

604
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,130
was good enough I think and we've put

605
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,710
all the code and demos for this online

606
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,190
most of it is in the great vet repo but

607
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,830
the actual flow graphs the those those

608
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,410
new radio companion flow graphs that we

609
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:28,040
used today are in Kate's presentations

610
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,260
repo which you can see up there and I've

611
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,240
been working on capturing the data that

612
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,740
we've been using from things like the

613
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,960
various sensors into that repository

614
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,790
hopefully will capture the accelerometer

615
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,770
as well which means or even without any

616
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,510
of this hardware download that even a

617
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,550
great fat download those pre captured

618
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,590
files and play with them yourself so if

619
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,850
you want to go and do crazy audio

620
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,040
effects on top of Mike's guitar playing

621
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,380
that is something that you can at home

622
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,580
go download this software and do and I

623
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,450
don't know if we have time for questions

624
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,580
we we have time for questions does

625
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,000
anybody have a question why this talk

626
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,020
raises several questions
