1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,170
cool so my name is Laurel Cummings there

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:07,560
we go

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,010
yeah that's me I have that face so like

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,809
he said I'm an electrical engineer I

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,139
have ended up in a life where I go to

6
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:17,880
weird and wonderful places around the

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,970
world and I build stuff on the fly with

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,240
the junk I find around me and so I ended

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,310
up having to accrue a really weird set

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,609
of skill set I do woodworking I do

11
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,340
welding all the time I am like a sailing

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,559
being able to do like collect skills is

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,430
pretty much my pastime and so my day job

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,309
is this I teach active duty military

15
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,370
members how to rapidly prototype in the

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,469
field so what does that mean it means

17
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,750
that I take Marines through a one-week

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,670
innovation boot camp and so we teach

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,469
them everything from 3d printing and CAD

20
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,710
to laser cutting to welding to soldering

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,750
Arduino electronics point-to-point

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,660
camera is raspberry PI's and Python as

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,280
much information as I can cram in their

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,280
heads I do and we spend a whole week and

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,590
we get them you know spun up just enough

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,299
to be able to Google stuff and be a

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,799
little dangerous this technology

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,020
um I give you guys all this context

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,360
about myself because I think it helps

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,670
explain why I end up in situations like

31
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,950
this this is the first time I ever went

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,390
to the Middle East about this time last

33
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,700
year I was in Kuwait and I'm like cool

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,950
I'm going to the desert it'll be weird

35
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,619
and different I'm usually on the coast

36
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:32,759
and of course the first time go to the

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,520
desert it's a once in a century flood

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,270
the entire time it is just flooding and

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,820
we have to deal with this while teaching

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,310
Marines and running around a country

41
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,229
that I've never been to and how do you

42
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,229
even begin to find welding gas right

43
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,369
when a whole country is underwater let

44
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:54,270
me back up a little bit

45
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,189
surprise this is actually talk about

46
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,759
sailing this is my passion this is a

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,100
sailing vessel Tracy Jean it's my dad's

48
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,880
boat so when I finished college in 2017

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,890
I decided that like hey I want to chill

50
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,378
out I want to take a month for myself

51
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,890
and so I agreed to help him do

52
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,710
the boat from Virginia down to Florida

53
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,080
he's like no it's gonna be ten days at

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,470
most about a month later we finally got

55
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,459
to Florida and so we took this path

56
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,330
there's something on the East Coast

57
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,700
called the intercostal waterway the ICW

58
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,000
and it is thousands of nautical miles of

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,780
internal shoreline and paths that be cut

60
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,430
out so boats can take like it's

61
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,790
essentially an inside path down and up

62
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,980
and down the coast instead of having to

63
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,750
go out to open sea this is really nice

64
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,940
because you can keep your fancy new boat

65
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,530
nice and pristine you don't have to get

66
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,510
it nasty with like flying fish and such

67
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,030
out in the big ocean but throm is is

68
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,400
that we have such a deep draft we had to

69
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,180
skip a whole section so we made it down

70
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,150
to North Carolina after about two weeks

71
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,190
and then we finally went out to sea and

72
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,910
had to get towed into Jacksonville

73
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,739
because this ten-day trip ended up

74
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,380
taking us a month because literally

75
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,260
everything went wrong the very first day

76
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,209
of the trip we actually broke the motor

77
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,310
and had to go back and had a false start

78
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,320
so what happened was that the shaft

79
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,690
actually slipped out of the coupler how

80
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,500
does that happen

81
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,540
no one knows we don't know why it

82
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,950
happened but it does and you're not

83
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,239
pulling that thing back in because it

84
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,190
weighs like a thousand pounds another

85
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,030
thing that was happening was our

86
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,190
batteries just weren't charging so I had

87
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,630
to figure out was it was it the

88
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,910
alternator was that the regulator who

89
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,380
knows I figured out it was the regulator

90
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,120
how to replace it with the regulator for

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,150
an f-150 just take a truck regulator

92
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,799
throw it in there and it works just the

93
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,290
same electricity is electricity but the

94
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,140
guy at O'Reilly's was very confused and

95
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,079
then now getting to the whole stranded

96
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,230
at sea bit we were out on the open ocean

97
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,910
going from North Carolina down to

98
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,700
Florida and the engine broke again in

99
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,440
the exact same way it did the first day

100
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,989
because of course and so we got okay

101
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:08,120
it's fine really out here for three days

102
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,980
we've got plenty of wind and we're a

103
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,810
sailboat we'll be fine

104
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,470
four hours later the mainsail rips the

105
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,329
clue which is the bottom corner holding

106
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,370
the whole thing tension just tears

107
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,709
completely and of course it happens

108
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,840
right at 7:00 p.m. when it's starting to

109
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,560
set

110
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,030
the sun's starting to set so I have to

111
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,190
sit up there for four hours in the dark

112
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,820
showing it back in so all these problems

113
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,620
were ones that we had to solve in order

114
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,440
to get back home right but they're very

115
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,740
obvious problems and so that makes step

116
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,960
zero of my like kind of process of how

117
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,790
do you deal with these situations really

118
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,490
easy okay the sail ripped fixed sail

119
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,590
okay regulator's broken replace

120
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,690
regulator and so these were all the

121
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,900
problems I had self to get to this point

122
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,510
this is my New Year's Eve in 2017

123
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,880
getting towed into Jacksonville by a

124
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,070
very confused set of Coast Guard's

125
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,320
people Coast Guardsmen we'll go with

126
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,910
that one

127
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,440
so this is how I spent my New Year's Eve

128
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,900
literally as the ball dropped just

129
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,400
sitting in the frigid cold of

130
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,080
Jacksonville Florida its snowed for the

131
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,669
first time in four years as we were

132
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,540
coming in I was so over it

133
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,550
so those situations are really easy but

134
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,080
gets a little harder when you're in

135
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,180
these circumstances this was the Grand

136
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,460
Bahamas about three days after Hurricane

137
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,430
Dorian had just left our company went

138
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,580
down it did first response and when you

139
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,050
are seeing this level of destruction

140
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,050
there are like literally everything's a

141
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,790
problem everything is broken

142
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,530
everything's been decimated and you

143
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,490
don't know where to start but what I've

144
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,750
actually realized is that we always

145
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,450
start by talking to people and it

146
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,860
actually is a process that's very

147
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,330
similar to radio I did a brief step

148
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,130
being doing radio journalism a little

149
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,410
bit and I realized that I have the same

150
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,479
behavior when I'm going to natural

151
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,610
disaster as I do when I am interviewing

152
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,310
someone for radio journalism I will when

153
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,110
I'm first getting set up I ask someone

154
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,580
to start talking about what they had for

155
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,979
breakfast this gives me like a whole

156
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:12,620
myriad of things I can accomplish first

157
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,479
thing I do is I start level setting I'm

158
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,729
changing my audio settings to be like

159
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:18,080
whether or not they're a loud talker

160
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,210
quiet talker whether there's background

161
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,220
noise I can set that level so my

162
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,690
recording sounds great makes my life

163
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,090
easier afterwards I'm getting them more

164
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,590
comfortable with me too I'm getting them

165
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,510
to open up by asking them a really kind

166
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,970
of silly question their answers from

167
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,190
like the very beginning are a little

168
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,759
less rigid the

169
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,469
they're getting warmed up to me they're

170
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:39,990
getting comfortable and finding their

171
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,999
voice again which makes them sound

172
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,099
better on the tape I mean you want to do

173
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:45,509
some more things in a natural disaster

174
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:46,740
because that's how you get people to

175
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,900
start telling you yeah you could fix my

176
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,449
car or like you can like just help me

177
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,999
get in touch with my family and by

178
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,589
remembering to be human in these

179
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,330
circumstances it really guarantee you an

180
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,110
opportunity to get at the good problems

181
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,580
okay so we have all these problems now

182
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,930
we've talked to everyone on the island

183
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,309
and we figured out what's going on and

184
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:07,169
everyone's got an issue what do we do

185
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:08,460
next

186
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,379
the best thing you could do is Mark

187
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,259
Watney this situation Oh for those who

188
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,389
aren't familiar mark Watney is a

189
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:16,589
fictional astronaut from the movie the

190
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:19,559
Martian or yes the Martian he

191
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:21,899
essentially is stranded on Mars

192
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,599
by himself a hostile planet that like no

193
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,909
one lives on has ever lived on and has

194
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:29,490
to figure out how to get home the movie

195
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,559
and the book do a really great job of

196
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,899
showing how his mental process goes to

197
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:36,300
breaking down the problem of crap I'm

198
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,669
stuck on Mars so he kind of goes through

199
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:40,169
this whole process of like you have the

200
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,089
big grand problem right and then you

201
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:44,129
have the three you can break that down

202
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,680
into three subcategories you gotta get

203
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,419
in touch with earth yeah I survived

204
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,520
that's the big one and you got to get

205
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,800
back home and by breaking these down

206
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,830
even further and kind of you know bucket

207
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,550
izing these problems you can find a way

208
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,279
to actually answer the big problem I

209
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,659
mean this process is incredibly

210
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:05,610
instrumental for these really stressful

211
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,199
situations where you don't have time

212
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,389
like maybe slow down and logically think

213
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,589
about these things so this process

214
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:13,349
really helps force you to start to go

215
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:15,149
through that and realizing that like hey

216
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:18,389
if I build a way to make water for my

217
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:18,899
crops

218
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,669
I also solved the problem of me as a

219
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,830
human being meeting water and you kind

220
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,199
of start to see what the optimal cause

221
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,580
and effect can be so we really got to do

222
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,680
this when we went to her to help out

223
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,929
after Hurricane Florence this was back

224
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:38,399
in fall of 2018 we went to Turkey and

225
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,159
Florence hit all of the Carolinas did a

226
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,958
similar thing to Dorian where it stalled

227
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,329
out over top of them for three days

228
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:47,760
again this one was only a category four

229
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,570
only kinda

230
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,000
for so it wasn't the same level of

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,690
destruction but it was still incredibly

232
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,430
you know ruining for the community so we

233
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,540
went down and we started talking to

234
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,639
people we got all of these problems this

235
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,440
is just from literally eight hours of me

236
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,959
talking to whoever I could find I was

237
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,639
talking to cops I was talking to priests

238
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,130
I was talking to Marines I was talking

239
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,259
to you know youth group leaders I was

240
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,880
talking to doctors literally I was

241
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,899
talking to people were just standing

242
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,190
around I'm like hey why are you standing

243
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,569
at this bridge they go I don't know if

244
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:18,029
it's gonna wash out or not oh okay keep

245
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:20,850
standing here huh so but I took all

246
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,350
these problems and I started to break

247
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,750
them down and categorize them because

248
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,490
you start to see what are the root

249
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,680
issues so you can sort of like see how

250
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,410
you need to parse this information into

251
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,779
solvable problems especially for the

252
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:34,829
time frame that you're there because

253
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:36,660
you're not there for six months you're

254
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,579
there for six days and they're gonna be

255
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,410
like really long days but you're still

256
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,389
only one person and you've only got so

257
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:44,190
much time in the world unless you have

258
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,940
time Turner in that case come talk to me

259
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,759
find me up to the talk so this leads us

260
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,199
to you're actually on the ground you're

261
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,490
actually got problems you're gonna solve

262
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,190
you got a deliverer because if you are

263
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,899
promising to solve one of those root

264
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,550
issues a huge problem for the community

265
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,860
you better deliver because they're gonna

266
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,370
start depending on you so this is

267
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,110
actually the thing that our CEO told me

268
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,000
when we were going down North Carolina

269
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,029
I'm his name's Brad he was a nerd for

270
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,160
hire essentially for the army in the

271
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,410
early 2000s in Iraq and Afghanistan so

272
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,389
he's seen his fair share of crappy

273
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:21,779
situations he said when you touch down

274
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,779
you guys have 24 hours to show someone

275
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,790
something that works otherwise they're

276
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,100
not gonna trust you you have to pretty

277
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,600
much prove to them that you're actually

278
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,790
gonna deliver and solve this issue in

279
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,529
their own brains so that they actually

280
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:37,490
give you the hard problems to solve and

281
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,660
this was something that like as an

282
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,639
engineer I've never been told if it

283
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,430
sucks turn in something in 24 hours and

284
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,949
my god how am I gonna do that so this is

285
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:48,810
the problem we end up facing we went to

286
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,300
Camp Lejeune Marine base that was right

287
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,410
in the middle North Carolina one of the

288
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,209
hardest hit areas outside of a new bird

289
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:58,230
and we were told that one of the big

290
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,649
problems with the hurricane was that

291
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,259
they didn't know when there are zillions

292
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,610
we're going to run out of gas

293
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,589
the hurricane lasted three whole days

294
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:08,869
and they had to have someone go out and

295
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,389
manually check each generator they've

296
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:15,259
over 420 generators on this base and the

297
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,329
problem is is that the gauges don't even

298
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:18,529
work on these generators because of

299
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,800
course they don't they had to dipstick a

300
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,540
generator that was running in the middle

301
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,629
of a hurricane while like you know the

302
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:28,610
hell is all raining down so I do not

303
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,019
envy that job so he said okay let's

304
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:32,059
let's fix this for next time because

305
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,949
there's gonna be another one it's the

306
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:37,069
Carolinas it happens but we go okay

307
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:38,389
that's gonna be easy though because it's

308
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:40,399
the military every generator should be

309
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,589
the same right standardization is their

310
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:46,339
thing no no it's not

311
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,559
Congress is deemed that the military has

312
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,199
to buy equally from every possible

313
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:53,269
source so they have to buy one generator

314
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:54,920
from Walmart one from Target one from

315
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,259
Home Depot one from Lowe's so it led to

316
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,929
about 200 different kinds of generators

317
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:02,209
on that base that they wanted us to

318
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:05,360
sensor eyes so we said okay you know

319
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,800
what we're gonna not even deal with that

320
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,759
problem we're just gonna get the working

321
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,399
prototype so this is the first version

322
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,279
we turned in in 24 hours yeah we turned

323
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,319
it in in a dis and wash bag cuz it's

324
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,929
waterproof and is it ugly yes but it

325
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:19,550
worked and we were able to show the

326
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,249
colonel for that base within 24 hours of

327
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:24,290
setting up a workshop we drove down with

328
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,470
you a u-haul we had 3d printers going

329
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,910
all this stuff and we showed this to

330
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,679
them and they went did you already have

331
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,079
this how did what where did it come from

332
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:35,029
did did you mail-order this what

333
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:36,199
happened

334
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:38,870
and so the sandwich bag actually has

335
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,209
kind of become almost a motif for us we

336
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:43,040
actually started designing circuits to

337
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,920
fit in sandwich bags because that is

338
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,179
something that's easily available for

339
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:49,549
people who are in the field specifically

340
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:52,639
we design for MRE bags for those who are

341
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,350
lucky enough to not know what an MRE is

342
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,509
it stands for meal ready it is a

343
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,749
dehydrated technically food tastes like

344
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:02,149
garbage meal that you can make in the

345
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,920
field and so you have to put it with

346
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,259
some hot water in a bag and swish it

347
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,139
around and let it soak and it's as awful

348
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,350
as it sounds but every marine will have

349
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,200
that bag

350
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,180
with them that is something that will be

351
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,650
standard for them you can even assume

352
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,240
that a sandwich baggie is a standard

353
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,340
item but you know every single person

354
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,380
will have an MRE bag and that is

355
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,100
waterproof but also sometimes you have

356
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,740
to settle for just being able to deliver

357
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,200
yourself safely from point A to point B

358
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
when we are in Kuwait and the flooding

359
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,060
started we had no idea what was going on

360
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,590
honestly we're all a little panicked no

361
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,810
one really spoke Arabic we had no idea

362
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,540
what was going on and so instead of be

363
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,280
able to provide viable solutions the

364
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,540
best thing we were able to do in that

365
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,850
situation was deliver ourselves to a

366
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,040
place safely and not become part of the

367
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,810
problem because that sometimes happens

368
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,520
in disasters when people show up and

369
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,290
they have all the best intentions but

370
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,780
they say hey I'm here to help I did not

371
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,000
bring any water or food for myself so if

372
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,350
I could have some of your supplies

373
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,060
that'd be fantastic and at that point

374
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,030
you are actively hurting the situation

375
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,390
is the unfortunate truth the next thing

376
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,700
is you have to the reps matter right

377
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,230
it's just like working out the gym or

378
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,540
practicing for any sort of situation

379
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,550
this is why we do drills of any kind

380
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,290
right why we have elementary kids going

381
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,570
through fire drills all that you have to

382
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,770
practice and you have to practice in

383
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,790
meaningful ways so what kind of practice

384
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,050
matters though you have to make sure

385
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,420
that you're good at making anywhere you

386
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,770
have to make sure that you're good at

387
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,330
making with whatever you've got around

388
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,520
you and that you can make the same

389
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,730
project multiple times I'm gonna explain

390
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,330
choice

391
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,080
so making anywhere you can make where

392
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,390
ever you can fit really is the

393
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,210
situations I end up in sometimes it

394
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,920
means that you're in the engine

395
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,770
compartment of a sailboat and you are

396
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,230
trying to solder with plumber's solder

397
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,430
and a butane torch while you're hanging

398
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,770
upside down over the engine trying to

399
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,860
get a regulator meant for a truck into a

400
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,940
boat and you just gotta suck it up

401
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,500
other times you're actually working out

402
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,900
of a night like a shipping container

403
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,580
actually happens a lot or you've started

404
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,890
carrying fake grass with us when we have

405
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,060
to build out shipping container

406
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,010
workshops because there's a lot cheaper

407
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,930
than carpet and it makes you feel a

408
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,550
little bit cozier but you're making the

409
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,700
best of a bad situation

410
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,040
right and then when we were in Okinawa

411
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,650
last they the classroom that they gave

412
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,200
us was really a tsunami fallout shelter

413
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,890
which we walk in we're like us is bleak

414
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,810
there's no windows it's literally just a

415
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,930
concrete box but actually turned out to

416
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,550
be a really cool situation because we

417
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,380
were able to draw in all the walls with

418
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,630
metal marking chalk so essentially with

419
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,430
whiteboards which is way fancy that we

420
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,560
usually get so getting comfortable and

421
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,870
all these kinds of situations really

422
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,790
matters because you don't know what's

423
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,530
gonna happen you don't know where you're

424
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,710
going to end up next thing is you got

425
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,380
comfortable building with anything so

426
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,550
when we went to the Bahamas that

427
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,220
everything on that image on this one

428
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,230
table was what we were able to take with

429
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,080
us we had to load it all into duffle

430
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,300
bags that can't get through security at

431
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,460
the airport that are below the 50 pounds

432
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,320
we only had four duffle bags there only

433
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,960
four of us going and you had to take a

434
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,030
3d printer as well but when you get

435
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,100
there that's all you've got you're not

436
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,130
gonna get Amazon Prime to show up right

437
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,510
so and you're not gonna be able to take

438
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,310
things from anyone else because everyone

439
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,280
needs it in that situation and I'm

440
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,940
honestly people aren't really

441
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,650
volunteering up their stuff right after

442
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,720
a disaster which is understandable cuz

443
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,820
they're they're in shock and a lot of

444
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,540
they've lost so much the other side

445
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,660
though the other image is from when we

446
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,840
were in Kuwait last time and we were

447
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,790
running a simulation essentially with

448
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,650
these Marines and we given them

449
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,110
paintball guns I said you guys get to

450
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,510
defend but only with these this is more

451
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,940
of freedom that they usually get and so

452
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,890
in the game mechanics of the game that

453
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,560
we were running essentially they lost

454
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,050
all of their paintball guns but not the

455
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,270
paintballs and then they realized that

456
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,699
they also had a t-shirt cannon that

457
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,170
we've given them for taking down drones

458
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,480
so I'm playing a bad guy and I'm walking

459
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,510
around a corner trying to be sneaky and

460
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,250
I like turn the corner and there's a

461
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,699
marine right there in my face he goes ah

462
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,860
fires a t-shirt cannon full of paintball

463
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,880
guns at my face and I sat there stunned

464
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,710
for about a minute and they go are you

465
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,900
out

466
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,350
and I'm like yeah I'm out you hit me but

467
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,450
late I was like super happy for them and

468
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,650
they were like why are you happy I just

469
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,940
shot you in the face of paintball gun

470
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,530
and I'm like because you made a

471
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,510
paintball gun out of a t-shirt cannon

472
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,490
which was something I never expected you

473
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,100
to do and that's fantastic and so be

474
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,540
able to improvise like that they built

475
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,040
it literally in five minutes on the

476
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,530
field being able to improvise like that

477
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,370
matters greatly and then this is the

478
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,360
other thing I was talking about be able

479
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,340
to build the same project as many ways

480
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,500
as possible so this is the full

481
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,750
lifecycle of the fuel gauge project that

482
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,400
we did down the North Carolina for the

483
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,910
generators the first version is crappy

484
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,220
24 hour version that we slowly got to

485
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,630
add some more complexity we made a

486
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,490
little more robust we were able to add

487
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,860
wireless communication and then that

488
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,020
last one the red one is the one from

489
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,570
that we made back at our shop taking

490
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,340
that project and going back into the

491
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,020
best-case scenario where we have all our

492
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,000
tools we have our bench I have my lucky

493
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,610
oscilloscope matters that because that

494
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,140
way you can make it the best possible

495
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,590
solution and now that I have that final

496
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,640
solution for the field generators I can

497
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,920
anytime I need to remotely monitor any

498
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,559
level of anything I've got that in the

499
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,880
back of my head I'm really a little

500
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,640
repository of all these little pieces of

501
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,010
projects that I can now start to apply

502
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,990
to any search circumstance any weird

503
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,020
situations you find yourself in and that

504
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,390
starts to make you a lot faster a lot

505
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,640
more effective in these kinds of

506
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,700
scenarios but the most important thing

507
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,100
in this whole process is following up

508
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,750
the following up stage is what really

509
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,940
makes you effective at doing

510
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,120
humanitarian response and helping people

511
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,240
out this is actually what we did in the

512
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,010
Bahamas when we got there we were one of

513
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,360
the first teams there we didn't even

514
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,870
realize that we were the first ones and

515
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,850
we didn't make gizmos we weren't making

516
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,640
our Dino widgets we weren't 3d printing

517
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,030
you know stints and such we were fixing

518
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,640
roofs we were serving meals we were

519
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,070
helping people letting people use our

520
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,680
Sat phone to call their family

521
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,940
let them know that they made it okay

522
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,830
because it's really important to

523
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,060
remember that like even though

524
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,920
technology is the thing that we are

525
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,630
fantastic with and that's what we're all

526
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,220
really passionate about at the end the

527
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,320
day we're all still humans and there are

528
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,180
certain things you have to do before you

529
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,190
get to get into the technology it's

530
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,240
important to remember that there are

531
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,920
other things outside of your 3d printer

532
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,110
that you can use like we're forgetting

533
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,810
that you know you can tap a screw

534
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,840
instead of having to 3d print a whole

535
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,630
new system right like we can sometimes

536
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,480
default to the tools we know

537
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,180
and speaking of 3d printers a big

538
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,740
problem that we're starting to see is

539
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,110
that people will leave technology like

540
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,360
that behind in these places in a

541
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,090
post-hurricane Bahamas or something and

542
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,040
just be like okay cool we gave you guys

543
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,130
a 3d printer goodbye we will see you

544
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,170
next fall like whatever like goodbye

545
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,300
have fun and they're still recovering

546
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,100
from disaster the recovery stage is

547
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,140
gonna take years and so now they have a

548
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,580
technology that they don't know what to

549
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,800
do with that they don't really have the

550
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,660
time to spin up on it they never got the

551
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,180
proper training for just sitting taking

552
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,160
up space they're probably gonna sell it

553
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,750
they're probably going to take it apart

554
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,760
for other parts if they we can figure

555
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,250
out like what parts do what so it's it's

556
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,140
very unsustainable and it's this really

557
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,610
kind of unhealthy attitude that we've

558
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,590
started to have about technology's gonna

559
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,510
save the world because we just give

560
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,640
people tools and we never teach them how

561
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,440
to properly implement them we don't

562
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,120
follow up to make sure that it didn't

563
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,820
break on them while they were gone

564
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,400
and that following up is actually really

565
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,810
important in terms of what we do for

566
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,210
these solutions so with North Carolina

567
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,310
we came back to our shop we built this

568
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,880
awesome

569
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,960
and result and we went back about four

570
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,240
weeks later and taught a group of

571
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,550
Marines and people who lived on the base

572
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,850
how to make it because like we were

573
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,520
saying this is a premeditate

574
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,130
solution for the next hurricane it

575
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,110
doesn't help them if we're you know six

576
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,630
hours away in Washington DC when the

577
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,010
next hurricane is coming because they

578
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,630
don't know how to do it themselves right

579
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,520
so you got to make sure that you leave

580
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,740
behind a way that that legacy that

581
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,900
information will be carried on and that

582
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,010
people will be a

583
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,860
to use this in the future and honestly

584
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,300
they may be even better than us because

585
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,160
they use those generators they were

586
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,170
working with them all the time and so

587
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,570
they were able to make sure that they

588
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,950
were like hey actually did you think of

589
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,990
this and that was awesome because you

590
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,310
want to make sure that you're talking to

591
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,170
the people who are actually going to use

592
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,580
the product you're using so when I was

593
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,100
preparing for this talk I was very

594
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,110
nervous and so I started reading a lot

595
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,000
of these old articles on hackaday and

596
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,620
trying to see Lycos anyone ever done any

597
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,580
disaster stuff and I found this one from

598
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,650
2017 after Hurricane Maria came through

599
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,810
and decimated the Puerto Rico and so

600
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,210
Jenny Jenny wrote this and she has this

601
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,010
one quote I just want to read it out in

602
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,960
our world of hardware hackers and makers

603
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,900
we are on the whole practical people we

604
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,850
exist to make and do rather than

605
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,070
endlessly talk seeing the plight of the

606
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,950
victims from Emma Jose or Maria leaves

607
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,990
us wanting to do practical things to

608
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,090
help because that's what we do but of

609
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,500
course we could do nothing because we're

610
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,820
thousands of miles away and probably

611
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,920
lack whatever skills or training are in

612
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,030
demand on the islands I really love this

613
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,980
this gave me a lot of hope because I was

614
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,380
worried that people weren't gonna care

615
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,130
uh-huh

616
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,680
I want to know that their people are

617
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,870
here who want to help and if this is how

618
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,630
it was back at 2017 it doesn't have to

619
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,270
be like this in 2020 I'm here to say

620
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,370
that we can be that bridge for you guys

621
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,530
if there's still interest in helping out

622
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,690
in these circumstances we've actually

623
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,200
tried this before we gave a talk at

624
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,920
Maker Faire after actually right after

625
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,950
Maria hit the British Virgin Islands we

626
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,580
my our CEO and he pretty much said hey I

627
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,930
just went to the bishop Virgin Islands

628
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,470
we had all these issues we need help we

629
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,240
have four major problems that we need

630
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,820
people to help us deal with makers will

631
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,440
build stuff we need you guys to help us

632
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,440
build stuff and build a solution and so

633
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,270
we got tens of thousands people reading

634
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,220
this we got you know hundreds of

635
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,680
comments we got act to the point of like

636
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,980
actual email follow-ups with about 20

637
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,950
people actual phone calls

638
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,600
and more questioning with about a dozen

639
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,440
and about two months later we finally

640
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,279
got one project back to us and we

641
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:22,200
couldn't be like we couldn't figure out

642
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,710
why this engagement wasn't happening and

643
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,359
I think that it's not that the

644
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,159
engagement wasn't happening I think that

645
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,059
it was the wrong crowd and so I actually

646
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,070
like really hope that the hackaday crowd

647
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,359
might be more interesting cuz I can give

648
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,139
you guys problems I can give you guys

649
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:41,220
quandary I can give you guys these

650
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,840
challenges if that's something that

651
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,389
there's interest in because the truth of

652
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:46,529
the matter is that these things are

653
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,299
gonna keep happening they're going to

654
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:49,649
keep happening they're gonna happen more

655
