[Music]

5
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:53,780
okay all right so our next speaker is

6
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,650
CEO and co-founder of inspect AR & PCB

7
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,600
layout and he's one of the owners of

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,720
Royal circuits advanced assembly his

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,729
professional focus is on making PCBs

10
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,280
easier and more deformed more affordable

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,470
through to design manufacturer assemble

12
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,690
and debug prior to his current work he

13
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,190
was an electrical engineer working on

14
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,330
EVs at Tesla and lasers at Exxon right

15
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,009
now he's going to be showing us

16
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:21,770
everything about how to debug a PCB

17
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,100
using augmented reality so please

18
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,600
welcome to the super conference stage

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,619
and may hear shop okay I've been

20
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:38,149
instructed to hold the mic okay just

21
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:41,240
kind of go on freeform here so thanks

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,649
for coming everybody my name is mahir

23
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:44,210
I'm the CEO and one of the co-founders

24
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,630
over at inspect our it's a tool that we

25
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,549
built to really fundamentally improve

26
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:51,860
the way that circuit boards are really

27
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,780
interacted with and fuel and enable

28
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,149
engineers to really deal with their

29
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,250
Hardware intuitively whether or not you

30
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,420
design the board and whether or not

31
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,610
you're familiar with EDA tools or even

32
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,399
the hardware design process boards

33
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,079
become a lot less intimidating a lot

34
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,899
more collaborative and reasonable to

35
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,250
actually deal with so we started and

36
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,530
kind of built this tool with the same

37
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,970
focus that I kind of just explained we

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,920
want to accelerate harder development

39
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,690
and this is kind of on the tail end of

40
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,010
the process once the board's been

41
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,920
manufactured and it's in your hands the

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,540
steps of going through and doing any

43
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,299
sort of debug rework inspection assembly

44
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:33,019
are now a lot easier to do so here's a

45
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,910
quick video kind of giving a rough

46
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,370
overview of the tool in action and using

47
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,650
augmented reality to kind of interface

48
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,750
with your PCBs but you can pretty much

49
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,989
highlight any net layer or component on

50
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:47,120
the board you get all the metadata in

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,550
one place and now you can share that

52
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,750
same information with other engineers

53
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,730
without having to go and send a bunch of

54
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,950
files from your EDA

55
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,870
tool and expect everybody to know how to

56
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,810
use all TM or or CAD or Kai CAD or Eagle

57
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,670
or whatever and just more intuitively

58
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,470
say where does this signal go what's

59
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,720
that parrot what's pin five where does

60
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,580
pin five go thinking a little more

61
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:12,819
intuitively and less tool based so I

62
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,099
mean just not I'm sorry I plugged more

63
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,660
just about us we work with all the EDA

64
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,599
tools after I just bashed it but an

65
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,980
Autodesk has been gracious enough to

66
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,170
give us a free office space in San

67
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,310
Francisco to kind of build a lot of

68
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,930
integrations with Eagle to make it kind

69
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,920
of more free and more agnostic EDA wise

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,019
same with all team an advanced assembly

71
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:34,269
kind of one of our partners with getting

72
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:38,230
a lot of early testing so does this

73
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,319
slide resonate with anybody in the room

74
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,239
so when I was designing boards at Tesla

75
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,340
and even a Taser it's like you got ten

76
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,310
different screens on your bench and they

77
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,900
all give different pieces of information

78
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,170
that while all relevant the relevant to

79
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,819
different people in the hardware def

80
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:55,959
process whether you're a firmware

81
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,440
engineer or an EE or a technician and

82
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,370
then if you want to translate this

83
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,319
information everybody or anybody else on

84
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,230
your team that's just another layer of

85
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,720
convolution and another place where you

86
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,609
can make mistakes and send the wrong

87
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:11,889
file and to send somebody even a test

88
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,440
instruction on hey test probe these pads

89
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,930
for a particular signal and send me back

90
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,519
what your results are on the scope or

91
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,310
the DMM you get an email with like 14

92
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,410
attachments and you don't know what's

93
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,690
necessarily referencing what to put it

94
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,600
really simply and so you could really

95
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,910
break that down to be kind of saying

96
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,500
that the EE lab experience today is

97
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,240
incredibly inefficient it's expensive

98
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,910
and it's error-prone and because it's

99
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,710
also inefficient and slow you may not

100
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,240
catch all the errors and kind of

101
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,780
prematurely do a reskin and our family

102
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,340
businesses board manufacturers and I

103
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,450
could promise you and not giving you a

104
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,950
break if you put a diode backwards

105
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,840
that's another $5,000 for the next set

106
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,360
of boards or whatever so to kind of

107
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,830
avoid that find the problems upfront you

108
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,120
want to be able to do things efficiently

109
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,099
and quickly and collaboratively and the

110
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,660
tool that we've built allows you to do

111
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,450
that there's probably another slide

112
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,530
there resonates with people I use

113
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,460
Microsoft Paint

114
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,669
more than all team when I was in EE

115
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:08,849
because I was taking screenshots of my

116
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,159
board layout and sending instructions to

117
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,870
other interns and E's and technicians on

118
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,879
the team saying hey here's a via that's

119
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,949
on this signal can you put a 10k and a

120
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,139
link two digit key datasheet and it's

121
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,199
like 30 minutes of a pretty highly paid

122
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,180
engineers time and you're pulling him

123
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,740
off in context switching just to get

124
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,289
your job done is pretty difficult and

125
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,060
it's really inefficient and then that

126
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,590
engineer leaves to go somewhere else and

127
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,539
you're like what's going on with this

128
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,310
board so to kind of keep the information

129
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,199
thread consistent you want a tool that

130
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,430
allows you to keep all that in one place

131
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,039
so the tool we built is really what

132
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,060
we're dubbing the workbench of the

133
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,889
future all your information in one place

134
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,990
from your design tools all the way to

135
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,879
your testing measurement tools with your

136
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,500
scope logic analyzers DMMs etc and you

137
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,969
get all the metadata in one place where

138
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:55,500
you can really kind of click on any

139
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,659
component more intuitively what's this I

140
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,789
see pull from digit key or wherever the

141
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,669
datasheet all the components the pin

142
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:04,620
outs you don't need to count up pins

143
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,389
anymore whereas pin eight where does pin

144
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:08,580
eight go pull the datasheet up right

145
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,169
away and just kind of work on your

146
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,969
boards and a way more intuitive process

147
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:13,589
than the fragmented nature that it's

148
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:16,860
done today so this is what kind of are

149
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,779
the results of us kind of pushing this

150
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,699
in enterprise and with a lot of other

151
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,560
people today and we just launched a free

152
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,000
version yesterday you guys can actually

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,770
download and use on the hackaday badge

154
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,870
and Arduino and soon a bunch of boards

155
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,849
from crowd supply and things like that

156
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,620
so getting brought up on boards and

157
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,789
using them is going to become a lot

158
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:38,610
easier so I wanted to switch the screen

159
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,139
and kind of show everybody a live demo

160
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,469
of this thing in action so the

161
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:48,120
Lighting's a bit off so excuse me for

162
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,520
that but can you guys okay so this isn't

163
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,319
Arduino that I'm actually playing with

164
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,009
right now on the on the desk so what

165
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:57,389
I've done I've just selected a couple

166
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,360
nets so in real time you can overlay any

167
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,129
net component or layer at the board at

168
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,649
the most basic level and see how things

169
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:05,250
are connected

170
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,069
where can I probe just kind of more

171
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,149
intuitive things like that like for

172
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:11,729
example if you wanted this this is a

173
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:14,069
problem that or something that I have to

174
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:16,769
do way more often than I'd like but find

175
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,889
where the closest ground pad is so I can

176
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,330
kind of probe my oscilloscope so I don't

177
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,879
have a big loop or whatever right so

178
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,639
let's say that I wanted to slight ground

179
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,479
on this board it's a little slow because

180
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,990
it was sharing the screen but that's

181
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,789
kind of interesting and you can see the

182
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,379
whole pad and you know you could change

183
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:38,969
the opacity to maybe put your finger

184
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:42,389
under and probe and it'll map but if you

185
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:43,560
really want to just get a more intuitive

186
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,669
sense of what's going on the board

187
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:46,229
whether your firmware engineer or just

188
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:47,400
somebody playing with hardware for the

189
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,949
first time you can more intuitively just

190
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:51,990
say show me just expose copper show me

191
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,090
just pads on the board and then you

192
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,860
could select ground and now it'll show

193
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,969
you everywhere that there's exposed

194
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:58,860
copper on the board connected to that

195
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,229
particular signal and it maps on the

196
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:02,849
back as well so I know that those pads

197
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:03,689
over there

198
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:08,520
connect to that signal and that's kind

199
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,569
of at the core the most simple way that

200
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:13,919
I can kind of describe what I've just

201
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,150
shown you guys but going through it you

202
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,770
could basically pick any components see

203
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,270
where it is on the board you could

204
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,340
actively search DNI and find all the

205
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,599
components that should or should not be

206
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,860
on the board because I know your

207
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,810
assembly shop I know if that's assembly

208
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,770
in these other shop to never make a

209
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,560
mistake but when they do you probably

210
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,760
want to catch it before you plug your

211
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,309
board in and fry it and so just a lot of

212
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,750
things like that become a lot easier in

213
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,130
the test and debug process you could

214
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,419
build out templates share them with your

215
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,328
technicians and save them like a board

216
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:44,430
familiarity guide a board bring up guide

217
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,320
so whether it's ten years later and

218
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,519
somebody's picking up the sport of your

219
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,680
company they can immediately just get

220
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,029
walked through the board as if the

221
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,890
engineer is kind of standing over the

222
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,839
shoulder so the way I can describe

223
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,209
another use case out of this is you can

224
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:59,820
ensure that everybody uses your boards

225
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,160
exactly as you intend them to which is

226
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,220
very often not the case so that's really

227
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,959
kind of what I have to show you guys I

228
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,970
went through a pretty quick do you guys

229
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,000
have any questions just throw out sure

230
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,010
yeah yeah so right now the platform the

231
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,519
the app actually supports iOS Android PC

232
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,920
and Mac so pretty much everything that

233
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,640
you could want and

234
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,620
no we don't we actually built it kind of

235
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,730
separate so it doesn't really matter

236
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,680
which is nice and then as far as EDA

237
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,430
tools go

238
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,870
we don't actually even need your design

239
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,190
files we just take the manufacturing

240
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,990
outputs and all that solicit kind of

241
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,790
user guide on the website but basically

242
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,279
whatever you would send to a more

243
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,779
advanced board manufacturer like IPC

244
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:45,700
files joerger backs to those will work

245
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,850
just fine with this any other question

246
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,490
yeah no not right now

247
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,410
sorry any other questions

248
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,410
sure

249
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,430
yeah great point so yeah absolutely so

250
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,350
the way it's done is to a really simple

251
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,710
30 second to a minute calibration step

252
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,060
the feeds a little so I think but you

253
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,270
guys can see this so ideally when you

254
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,440
kind of make a login you'll have a

255
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,940
project page with all your different

256
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,860
boards on they you can have boards set

257
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,740
between teams and share calibration sets

258
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,780
for this particular board you can

259
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,100
configure whether it's unpopulated

260
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,770
populated have your different ones this

261
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,360
is a teal Arduino I know the Arduino

262
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,310
guys are in the room there's like a

263
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,380
whole mix up with them I had the teal

264
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,000
one and the blue one and then a couple

265
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,440
of different silkscreen overlays in the

266
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,450
original files so playing with that was

267
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,310
kind of funny earlier but you basically

268
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,780
go in and you can have a calibration

269
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,390
step it'll be kind of laggy to do it

270
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,600
right now but basically it just asks you

271
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,040
to take a photo of the board and we have

272
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,220
a nice onboarding user guide it'll make

273
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,810
sure you're doing things right way and

274
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,270
the cameras a little lopsided but that's

275
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:04,090
the oh it's car that's the idea so

276
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:11,260
excuse me for that no okay and then the

277
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,620
last thing do how much time do I have

278
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,180
one minute okay then I'll do this really

279
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:32,500
quickly yeah he is this camera working

280
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,350
okay so I'm gonna put the mic down and

281
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,100
just show and talk

282
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:59,320
no oh okay well this so long story short

283
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,370
if you'd like to experience this

284
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,900
yourself you can go to inspect a yard

285
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,090
calm and sign up for the free download

286
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,260
and have it on your phone

287
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,790
pre calibrated ready to go with an

288
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,220
Arduino Hackney badge and soon a bunch

289
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,020
of boards from crowd supply to help you

290
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,610
get up and running in like less than two

291
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,430
minutes and then any feedback you guys

292
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,780
have would of course be super super

293
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,870
welcome that's all thanks guys

294
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,269
[Applause]
