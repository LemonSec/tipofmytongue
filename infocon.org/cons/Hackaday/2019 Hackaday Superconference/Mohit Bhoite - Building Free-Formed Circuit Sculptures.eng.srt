00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,610
welcome back I hope everyone had an

3
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,920
excellent lunch it's my pleasure to

4
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,950
introduce the next speaker for today you

5
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,380
are already aware of his work as senior

6
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,870
hardware engineer at particle building

7
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,440
excellent IOT devices but also from his

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,479
amazing Twitter photos that you've seen

9
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,260
of circuit sculptures based mainly on

10
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,320
brass rods being formed together in very

11
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,259
interesting 3d patterns today's going to

12
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:19,850
deliver the inside track on how to build

13
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,890
your own freeform circuitry please

14
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,270
welcome to the a kadai super conference

15
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:32,960
stage Mohit Bo eat a mic check

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,560
everything good thank you thank you for

17
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,300
the introduction Mike thank you for

18
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,950
taking the time out to come listen to

19
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,530
this talk I know a lot of you might have

20
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,250
been hungry but I hope you are now your

21
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,700
tummy box is full of delicious foods so

22
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,970
today I'm going to talk about building

23
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,440
free from certain sculptures primarily

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,960
out of brass and how you too can make

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,490
your own circuit sculptures in your free

26
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,680
time

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,180
as Mike noted I'm a senior hardware

28
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,580
engineer at particle how many of you

29
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,799
have heard of particle particle IOT oh

30
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,970
wow nice

31
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,000
so at particle those who don't know what

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,959
particle is we build complete end-to-end

33
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,940
solutions for building IOT devices all

34
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,500
the way from bits and pieces of hardware

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,260
all the way to cloud you must be

36
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,060
familiar with these dev kits that we

37
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,910
make for Wi-Fi connected devices

38
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,290
cellular connected devices

39
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,600
more recently the gen 3 which is feather

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,410
for a feather form factor compatible a

41
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,640
lot of our products go into exotic bath

42
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,970
tubs or HVAC systems or even in surf

43
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,420
surf ins to monitor ocean currents and

44
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,120
temperatures and all the fancy stuff but

45
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,260
today we are going to talk about

46
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,220
building free from circuit sculptures

47
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,590
traditionally as most of you know we

48
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,060
build circuits with printed circuit

49
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,650
boards you have a pre printed circuit

50
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,220
board and then

51
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,080
you add components to it you solder it

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,450
it goes into an enclosure and never sees

53
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,600
the light of the day that's that's it

54
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,030
but there are other ways of making

55
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,370
circuits they call it dead bug air wire

56
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,610
a point-to-point and the idea is that

57
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,090
you without a PCB can interconnect and

58
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,510
make these circuits but this is not a

59
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,610
new new thing people have been doing

60
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,610
this way before even wires existed let

61
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,400
alone circuit boards but then why are we

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,260
in 2019 building preformed circuits when

63
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,690
you have access to jlc PCB PCB way ash

64
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,830
Park all these new fast and around PCB

65
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,280
shops well there are numerous reasons

66
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,950
you need a quick prototype you don't

67
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,110
have access to a proto board or PCB you

68
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,690
are in a pinch you want to keep things

69
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,690
really really small or you're debugging

70
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,270
something I know Greg here from

71
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,100
Australia who builds these amazing

72
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,720
circuit boards uses his failures and

73
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,030
PCBs and his debugging style almost as a

74
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,940
art form and that's what we are going to

75
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,640
do here we are going to design circuit

76
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,190
sculptures as circuits freeform circuits

77
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,570
as an art form circuits that look

78
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,430
something like this the idea being you

79
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,380
free the components out of there

80
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,970
you know constraints of a circuit board

81
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,520
and bring them to life some use a PCB

82
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,620
some don't some use a passive device

83
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,350
some use active devices semiconductors

84
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,590
some are mobile some are static so how

85
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,479
did I get into preforming as a teenager

86
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,940
growing up in Mumbai India I came across

87
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,490
this philosophy of beam robotics I'm

88
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,070
sure many of you are aware biology

89
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,479
electronics esthetic mechanics that's

90
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,310
how I got into electronics is because I

91
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,669
wanted to build robots in circuits with

92
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,590
whatever was available so I have been

93
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,140
building these beam robots as a teenager

94
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,740
out of you know broken Walkman broken

95
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,620
cameras so mark Tilden has been a big

96
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,750
influence there have been so many

97
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,940
beautiful beam creatures built in the

98
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,640
19th and the early 2000s a lot of them

99
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,260
they're powered by solar

100
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,540
none of them used microcontrollers this

101
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,250
was the discipline the days before

102
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,750
Arduino came to life I also am an active

103
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,810
ham radio enthusiast so building

104
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,170
circuits rapidly out of copper clad you

105
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,700
know using that as a ground reference

106
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,280
plane and quickly mocking up circuits

107
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,700
one time circuits is one another way

108
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,290
that I have was introduced to freeform

109
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,970
circuits

110
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,980
another big influence is Peter Vogel

111
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,020
he's a German musician and an artist who

112
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,480
was / if ik and the 80s and the 90s

113
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,490
building interactive sound sculptures so

114
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,680
that was that was the foundation for

115
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,510
what would I would describe as my

116
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,420
inspiration for getting into free from

117
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,470
circuit building fast forward to 2015 I

118
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,270
was at Ace Hardware like most of us are

119
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,850
on a Sunday afternoon going through

120
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,400
things to you know collecting parts to

121
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
build your next project well while there

122
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,590
I came across these brass extrusions

123
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,830
these brass tiny tiny brass rods cubes

124
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,240
tubes and it struck to me I had the aha

125
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,030
moment like why not use these brass rods

126
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,800
to create these free from interconnects

127
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,740
for circuit sculptures so I took a bunch

128
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,860
of brass rods home and I plead with

129
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,890
creating this very first brass freeform

130
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,810
circuit sculpture using a seven segment

131
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,520
display that I had lying around and a

132
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,560
particle photon which is now makes it

133
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,990
internet-connected I went through a few

134
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,440
revisions trying to I trait and see what

135
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,170
could be built with the simple display

136
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,300
and a microcontroller board just like

137
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,490
you know rearranging things how they

138
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,620
were connected trying to give them

139
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,510
personalities because the idea is not

140
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,610
just to create the circuit but allowing

141
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,580
the circuit to convey or talk to you and

142
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,750
you know various forms but then why Brax

143
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,310
you know there are other things that

144
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,090
there is like 10 copper copper itself

145
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,130
other metals and why choose brass well

146
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,610
brasses to my surprise extremely easy

147
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,160
disorder it's stiffer than Cocker's it

148
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,890
will hold its shape better it's easy to

149
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,990
cut in band it's beautiful because it

150
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,600
the warmth allows it

151
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,080
well with wood and a lot of it is

152
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,580
recycled so you don't feel bad about

153
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,770
adding to the he wastes as my date

154
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,850
observes designing PCBs and brass rods

155
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,390
are you know available in various shapes

156
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,860
and forms you can get them at Ace

157
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,440
Hardware black arts other hobby stores

158
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,470
these are primarily made by a company

159
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,960
called Kees Kiana's metals are based out

160
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,370
of Chicago but this is option one option

161
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,580
two is you buy a brass wires in bulk and

162
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,900
then straighten it out there's a

163
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,000
technique using a drill press and a

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,940
plier and twisting the wire and it holds

165
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,090
its shape as a straight rod but all

166
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,430
right enough about brass how do we

167
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,620
actually start building one of these I

168
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,780
don't need to go through the tools and

169
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,730
scales because most of you have all of

170
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,770
this may be patience is something that

171
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,210
we might need to work on but as for a

172
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,830
soldering iron have a very basic Weller

173
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,500
it's a 50 watt soldering iron that I I

174
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,050
think won in a competition with Maker

175
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,150
Faire I think ten years ago but I still

176
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,309
keep on using it because that's a tool

177
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:35,740
that's available to me anything that is

178
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,059
temperature controlled has a replaceable

179
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,370
tip and brass work brass will goes a

180
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,429
long way with every single solder joint

181
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,100
try to clean your tip so that your

182
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,640
solder joints are cleaner solder

183
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,900
standard soldering solder with no clean

184
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,680
or washable flux using flux my favorite

185
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,290
tool is the flux pen that dispenses

186
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,080
liquid flux over paste because it's just

187
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,230
so easy to apply to you know small

188
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,600
locations I need you can't really overdo

189
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:07,950
it

190
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,060
if you have a piece of paper underneath

191
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,460
your solder joint it you know sucks away

192
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,450
the extra flux so that's very helpful

193
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,890
these are the two tools that I primarily

194
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,100
use flat nose needle pliers and these

195
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,470
diagonal cutters I didn't know how many

196
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,450
of you aware but there are these magical

197
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,070
diagonal cutters that have a retainer

198
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,160
clip so when you clip the lead it

199
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,810
doesn't go flying off you know into

200
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,900
somebody's eyes it stays on the cutter

201
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,540
so something that I discovered was

202
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,730
magical

203
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,630
so how does one work with brass as I

204
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,700
said brass loves to be soldered loves to

205
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,920
be bent and it's it's very therapeutic

206
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,140
when you start bending these brass wires

207
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,900
you should give it a try I start off

208
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,760
with marking things with a graphite

209
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,410
pencil just because the graphite can be

210
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,180
rubbed off with your fingers you don't

211
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,550
have to use scratch it or use a sharpie

212
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,940
to make those markings you cut it and

213
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,850
then this is where the tool really

214
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,810
shines no flying project tells if you

215
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,500
play pay close attention the cut is not

216
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,510
equal you know one side is flush the

217
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,000
inside is wedge or pinched depending

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,890
upon the kind of angle that you're

219
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,660
trying to solder it on it may or may not

220
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,240
help you but again like when you're

221
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,190
working with legs such small geometries

222
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,910
of 0.8 millimeter brass rod it really

223
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,640
doesn't matter you bend it with the

224
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,480
nozzle nose flat nose pliers I usually

225
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,110
draw the template using Adobe

226
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,970
Illustrator and get a printout to scale

227
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,190
and then use that as a template as I go

228
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,310
bending and within one or two tries you

229
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,460
can get fairly accurate at bending the

230
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,560
brass rods at whatever angle you want I

231
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,840
stick to angles not curves just because

232
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,330
I haven't figured out how to do curves

233
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,450
well I think jewelries might be able to

234
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,400
do something like that but I stick to

235
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,650
angles straight angles soldering

236
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,060
extremely straightforward you tape it

237
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,810
with a a masking tape or a scotch tape

238
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,010
so that it doesn't leave behind any

239
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,960
residue you apply flux solder and then

240
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,950
when you solder the brass you know

241
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,910
decolorize it a little bit you know if

242
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,620
there's a tarnish and but it's very easy

243
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,580
to fix you use a triple zero knee number

244
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,560
steel wool and file it or rather a brush

245
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,480
it and then you end up with a very clean

246
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,690
looking joint this as easy as that

247
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,420
there's like no rocket science to

248
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,520
soldering brass you don't have to use a

249
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,320
heavy board soldering iron you don't

250
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,260
have to use any special solder the

251
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,290
soldering flux goes a long way as far as

252
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,730
the process of building the sculptures

253
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,590
goes

254
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,330
it's a standard process you sketch an

255
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,460
idea you do a schematic layout you

256
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,920
breadboard you make templates and jigs

257
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,800
and you solder as far as salt

258
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,470
sketching goes I have just like a whole

259
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,529
bunch of binder just full of just random

260
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:10,400
sketches the idea is to just not let the

261
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,710
end functionality come in the way and

262
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,260
just just create mock-ups and it also

263
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,970
helps to create constraints by saying

264
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,950
like hey I'm gonna make specials draw

265
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,040
spaceships today or I'm going to make

266
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,360
handheld gaming consoles or I'm going to

267
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,480
make something that displays numbers and

268
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,670
by doing that you can come up with more

269
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,089
ideas in that particular domain as far

270
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:34,279
as schematically outs go I stick to ego

271
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,370
but you can use kicad or any other tools

272
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,970
Under the Sun I also like to stick to

273
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,060
0.1 inch pitch it just makes the

274
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,730
interconnects spacing easier to manage

275
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,290
and it just looks aesthetically pleasing

276
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,710
when everything is uniform you can use

277
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,820
complex dev boards like the photon or

278
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,880
the Arduino or any other Deadwood of

279
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,980
your choice as long as it has this point

280
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,440
one inch headers the interconnects

281
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,650
become very very easy as I said Autodesk

282
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,530
ego key card or even Fritzing even if

283
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,030
you don't have any of these tools

284
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,430
installed you can still use you know

285
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,839
paper and pencil to draw these

286
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,540
schematics once you draw the schematic

287
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,180
it's time to breadboard so every single

288
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,680
sculpture that I build starts on a

289
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,450
breadboard just because it's easier to

290
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,880
tune values you know things works things

291
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,170
don't work and then move on making

292
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,120
templates there's so many different ways

293
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,330
of making templates I prefer just using

294
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,060
Eagles PCB layout but not necessarily to

295
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,400
make PCBs but to make these templates

296
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,280
true to scale where I can use them to

297
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,300
solder these these modular blocks and

298
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,160
once you stack these all together you

299
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,620
end up with something like this this is

300
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,020
a simple triple 5 oscillator at the

301
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,950
bottom a BCD counter and then a BCD to

302
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,850
it a d-max

303
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,850
at the top and it looks something like

304
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,110
this does it play

305
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:12,620
[Music]

306
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,210
the idea is the finished product looks

307
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,550
something even more complicated than

308
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,080
what it starts with it's just you know

309
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,510
adding stages or adding layers to and

310
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,000
you know as you're building you don't

311
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,740
have to go all 3-dimensional on

312
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,150
something you can make something that is

313
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,910
just a simple LED blinker so this is a

314
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,250
PCB layout that is used as a template to

315
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,640
create this freeform sculpture sometimes

316
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,040
I break the rule of making everything

317
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,510
point one and she's just because

318
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,510
packages aren't available this was one

319
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,240
project where I cursed and cried as to

320
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,640
why am I doing this my day job is

321
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,560
designing circuit boards and you get

322
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,270
things done with a circuit but why put

323
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:57,260
yourself to the whole pain of bending

324
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,270
brass wires and soldering it and burning

325
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,540
if it fingertips but you know you if you

326
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,430
push through it you end up with

327
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,380
something that you know I you can't be

328
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,430
proud of so this is a simple handheld

329
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,160
gaming console that I call you know the

330
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,530
series as handled with care because I

331
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,330
found these handles out of measuring

332
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,610
spoons and the measuring spoons I

333
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,950
discarded them and left with like these

334
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,290
half a dozen wooden spoons that I wanted

335
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,910
to use somehow so I made this little

336
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:33,140
console with bicolor LEDs using a tiny

337
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,290
ADA Adafruit trinket at the back a lipo

338
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,690
battery in the enclosure and then the

339
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,510
idea is you know the good ol Nokia snake

340
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,570
game you know the green snake is just

341
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,470
like chasing the red fruit so something

342
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,650
that you could do it doesn't always have

343
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,210
to be functional you know this is

344
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,570
something that I did for pure vanity

345
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,710
it drew this pattern on Adobe

346
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,540
Illustrator to you know take a printout

347
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,880
true to scale and use that as a template

348
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,400
to solder things together the

349
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,930
inspiration for this came from you know

350
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,480
old Islamic geometric patterns where you

351
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,150
use you know reoccurring patterns and

352
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,810
geometries to create art so this is a

353
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,880
simple back sight alarm clock that was

354
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,790
inspired by a spaceship from Star Wars

355
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,800
one of the recent sculpture uses a

356
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,660
different shape and formed by the same

357
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,400
end result is if it's a bedside clock

358
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,710
that uses brass and seven segment

359
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,850
displays to show time so when you're not

360
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,300
using PCB as templates you can make

361
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,390
fixtures and this is where the point one

362
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,070
inch is your friend because you can use

363
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,700
prota boards breadboards PCBs to create

364
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,360
these jigs to hold your piece in place

365
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,090
so this is a combination of using a

366
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,770
printed template on a piece of paper to

367
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,210
bend the wires and then stack these

368
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,220
together space them out with a proto

369
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,710
board solder these together and then you

370
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,480
end up with something that looks like

371
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,849
this which is again a collection of

372
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,760
two-dimensional objects assemble

373
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,710
together

374
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,089
another method is that you create these

375
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,460
makeshift for the face you will see

376
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,960
there's a pro tempore with female

377
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,940
headers that is just something to hold

378
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,210
the the brass in place as I go on

379
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:31,450
soldering these in place for boxes or

380
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,830
straight angles I use a machinist square

381
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,830
and just line it up and that's as easy

382
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,850
as that there's no special jig or

383
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,650
machined fixture to hold things in place

384
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,500
it's just usually usually using scotch

385
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,430
tape and a square and I usually stick to

386
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,740
as I said straight angle just because I

387
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,330
don't have these skills to do curves yet

388
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,500
and then you end up with something like

389
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,890
this again boxes stacked together

390
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,560
interconnected this is a thermometer I

391
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,390
have that with me so if you want to come

392
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:05,860
take a cool

393
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,679
look you know I'll take it out of my

394
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,559
backpack the idea was you can create

395
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,080
this on a PCB or on a breadboard but

396
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,390
then how about you how do you go about

397
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,870
making something that as as if it's like

398
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,500
talking to you the idea that you use

399
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,570
anthropomorphic forms in a way where it

400
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,460
has eyes and it's an antenna and it has

401
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,620
body and all these are functional blocks

402
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,280
although the entire chassis is ground

403
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,010
while the next carry power and data to

404
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,780
the new your pixel at the bottom you can

405
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,169
use seven segments just seven segment

406
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:43,390
displays creatively to create emotions

407
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,770
by blinking or you know using different

408
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,140
segments to create emotions or

409
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,760
expressions when you're not using these

410
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,250
make sure fixtures or circuit boards you

411
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,400
can make 3d printed jigs this comes in

412
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,750
really really handy when you're creating

413
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,640
repetitive patterns of creating you know

414
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,570
matrices I was able to reuse some of

415
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:13,480
these jigs to create a 8x8 matrix but

416
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,679
also a diagonal sorry a hexagonal matrix

417
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,750
which I had to create custom points for

418
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,760
this was challenging because you don't

419
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,070
really come across hexagonal matrices

420
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,240
and you know you can't just like

421
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,880
download the font see if I had to hard

422
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,870
code the font

423
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,290
one led at a time and looks something

424
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:37,090
like this I get no real purpose this is

425
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,059
you know remember we're having fun with

426
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,950
the same things we do every day which is

427
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,500
build hardware so it just counts down

428
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,250
for was a little awkward the eights and

429
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:56,290
nines and zeros are nice but you don't

430
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,179
have to just create matrices for the

431
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:01,179
sake of making matrices the one on your

432
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,910
left is a sound level meter using the

433
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,570
traditional LM three nine one four chip

434
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,740
that I don't think they even make

435
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,490
anymore and it you know it just

436
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,590
basically measures you the decibel and

437
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,540
it's like a

438
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,200
the word graphic sexual equalizer the

439
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,090
one on the right is another second in

440
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,650
the series of handle with care' which is

441
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,120
literally a torch

442
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:33,280
but with LEDs in a matrix form see the

443
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,260
idea is instead of feeding the audio

444
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:43,750
this has a microphone on it you can go

445
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,490
beyond circuits it doesn't have to be

446
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,800
always circuits modern makers have been

447
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,440
using brass as a to go for many many

448
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,090
years to create model trains and you

449
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,370
know railroad tracks and other objects

450
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,110
so in this particular project I was

451
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:03,820
using these tiny brass gear head motors

452
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,890
that also love to be soldered with the

453
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,990
standard 50 watt soldering iron and the

454
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,390
tubes to hold and make the source the

455
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,040
structure and the chassis you can use

456
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,440
the tubes carry wires through it so the

457
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,240
end result looks cleaner in this case

458
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,460
using an Adafruit motor driver along

459
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,810
with the particle xenon which is the

460
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,630
bluetooth-enabled dev kit along with

461
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,000
some vintage resistors that I found at

462
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,750
an surplus store and this was a project

463
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,600
I called xenian because it was using

464
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,130
xenon to make a NAND cat and the idea is

465
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,280
the tail will shoot rainbows if you take

466
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,010
a long exposure photograph but instead

467
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,840
of just doing lines it can also do

468
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,130
patterns or it can write texts and the

469
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,660
way I was doing this since it was blue

470
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,940
thought I could directly send text

471
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,490
messages or graphics as bitmaps and it

472
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,430
will drive itself and you take a long

473
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:06,150
exposure photograph here's it in action

474
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,820
and then that's it you don't even have

475
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,029
to stick to brass you can mix brass with

476
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:20,539
other elements like wood or glass you

477
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,980
don't have to be shy with circuit boards

478
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,929
this is not like a purist game we're

479
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:25,549
like oh I hate circuit boards I will

480
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:27,529
never use circuit boards the idea is to

481
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:30,440
create this in between where you use

482
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,240
brass as a simple way to interconnect

483
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,940
circuit boards together of maybe wood to

484
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,880
hold it all together and using something

485
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,990
like a new meter on display to display

486
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:46,460
information some additional thoughts on

487
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,490
powering your sculptures I usually use a

488
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,639
USB port instead of using a battery

489
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,260
because batteries needs to be charged

490
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,610
and you know it creates unnecessary

491
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,529
waste I'm not going to you know have

492
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:00,710
these somewhere powered over a battery

493
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,210
and then have to worry about charging or

494
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,360
even replacing the coin cells so USB is

495
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,429
a great way a simple wired power it also

496
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:11,570
works you know something that is

497
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,830
breadboard able so you stick it on a

498
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,600
breadboard use a bench top power supply

499
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,720
and power it sometimes I do use

500
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,870
batteries tiny lipo batteries there you

501
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,860
can charge or solar cells these were

502
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,960
again an ex-jock item that I found at a

503
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,399
surplus store like old vintage silicon

504
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:32,870
and amorphous if I'm saying this right

505
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,860
and these were inspired by beam

506
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,909
philosophy we're here using discrete

507
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:39,679
logic gates to create these solar

508
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,350
engines that charge all day and then you

509
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,169
know blink a tiny little light on night

510
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:46,610
long and they're usually called plumbers

511
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,769
I have one of those here as well if you

512
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:51,500
want to take a closer look further

513
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,740
resources hackaday was kind enough to

514
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,169
host a competition almost a year ago

515
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:01,960
that and there were so many amazing

516
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,919
sculptures and I think some of you

517
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,080
already are here who contributed to this

518
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,720
competition and so this as an art form

519
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,840
has really taken off and I think it's

520
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,179
just like any other medium like paint or

521
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:17,480
clay using circuit sculptures to you

522
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,470
know convey

523
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,520
your artistic abilities or use that as -

524
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,840
as an expression is a neat way I want to

525
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,550
give out a shout out to URI brows I

526
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,870
don't know if I'm saying his name

527
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,930
correctly but he made this beautiful

528
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,940
canna Matic sculpture which is blooming

529
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,970
tulip which is not just static but it

530
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,850
you know literally moves and blooms if

531
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,170
he uses the word if you stroke it he

532
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,930
also made a challenge but he was making

533
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,550
sculptures every single day and these

534
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,560
circuit these sculptures don't even have

535
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,120
any complicated circuit it's just a

536
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,790
simple coin cell and LEDs but the amount

537
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,790
or the variety of things you could do

538
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,620
with simple coin cell and LEDs it's just

539
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,630
a mind-boggling and not only that he's

540
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,940
also documenting these processes on

541
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,350
YouTube and you know creating these

542
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,140
documentation so big shout out to him to

543
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,130
help you know promote this art form and

544
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,490
so that's it thank you for coming here

545
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,920
we have I have some of the sculptures

546
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,080
with me but if you want to follow me on

547
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,050
instagram or twitter my handle is my boy

548
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,050
Jay or you can go onto my website to

549
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,170
take to get high-resolution images of

550
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,740
the sculptures

551
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:44,429
