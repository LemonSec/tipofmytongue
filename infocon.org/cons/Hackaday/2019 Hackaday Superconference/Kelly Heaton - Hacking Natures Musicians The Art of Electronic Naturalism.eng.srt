00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,010
welcome back our next speaker build

8
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,230
circuits that generate waveforms that

9
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,930
kind of mimic things that are found in

10
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,390
nature she's really interested in

11
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,380
machines relating to nature and nature

12
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,380
relating to machines she's going to be

13
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,360
talking about analog circuits that she's

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,400
designed that mimic animal sounds

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,900
please welcome to this hackaday super

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:37,460
conference stage Kelly Heaton hi

17
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,380
everybody thank you so much for being

18
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,300
here it's such an honor to get to

19
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,490
address an audience that understands

20
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,780
what I do in my art so I am a fine

21
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,420
artist I come from that background but

22
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,100
I'm fascinated with the spark of life

23
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,290
and with electricity as a medium I think

24
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,930
that of all the media in our culture

25
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,180
today electricity is absolutely the most

26
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,540
important it is the tool that has

27
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,880
changed civilization so radically that

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,729
it's precipitated a new geologic era

29
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,800
right the Anthropocene because with

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,380
electricity were just that powerful so

31
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,239
as an artist I feel like wow you know

32
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,440
it's just something I want to dig my

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,769
teeth in and be able to work on and then

34
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,959
also before I get started here on my

35
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,290
slides I just wanted to read a quote

36
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,720
from my favorite electronics teacher

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,600
Forrest MEMS many of you probably know

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,900
him this comes from an email dialog that

39
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,200
I had with Forrest where he said analog

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,930
electronics parallel living organisms

41
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,269
while programmable logic merely

42
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:43,970
simulates life and that's something that

43
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,940
I really believe in and as you'll see

44
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,610
coming up here on my slides I've tried

45
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,340
to dig into my practice but before I get

46
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,560
into my electronic work I wanted to show

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,380
you a couple of images created by

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,090
artists who've had inspired me

49
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,500
throughout my career and they and and

50
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,870
the depictions like of the charge Burt

51
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,600
Charles Burchfield image here on the

52
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,830
left is

53
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,020
an effort by a visual artist to

54
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,000
represent electricity right it has this

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,160
wonderful vibratory quality and of

56
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,480
course I think that's the also the

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,280
success of Van Gogh's paintings is that

58
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,560
we can just feel them vibrating like we

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,740
can almost see the electricity in them

60
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,150
and then the other image I included is

61
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,120
from Audubon because he just had this

62
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,220
intense observation of nature and that's

63
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,040
something that I carry on into my

64
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,440
practice so these three images are from

65
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,360
my work and they represent different

66
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,780
facets of the kind of work that I create

67
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,300
the large image is a watercolor painting

68
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,790
of a cricket with an analogue electronic

69
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,860
circuit built into it that chirps like a

70
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,790
cricket and then in the upper top corner

71
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,850
is one of my analog electronic songbirds

72
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,300
that is folded out of transparent mylar

73
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,670
and inside of the songbird you can see

74
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,490
visibly the analog electronic circuit

75
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,400
that generates the song of the bird and

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,690
then a PCB detail of a piece called

77
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,550
pretty bird that chirps sort of like a

78
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,970
Carolina wren so I want to say before I

79
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,329
move on here to to play this video for

80
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,890
you this is going to show you a little

81
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,930
bit so you can hear the sounds of what

82
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,130
I'm creating what my circuits are

83
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,410
actually doing I just want to say that

84
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,060
all like everything that you're hearing

85
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,250
is entirely generated by discrete

86
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,110
component analog electronic circuits

87
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,230
there are no audio recordings and I

88
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,330
don't use software so this is like this

89
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,090
is really Hardware art so here we go

90
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,619
um the the center element that you see

91
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:58,089
there with all the wires coming out of

92
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,029
it that that's actually my analog

93
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:03,369
electronic sequencer board so the reason

94
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,509
why you're not carrying like the

95
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:06,429
crickets or the others found solely

96
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:10,379
constantly is because that board is

97
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,639
turning them on and off and I'll talk

98
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,939
about that a little bit later so now as

99
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,860
I'm moving around the scene you're

100
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,649
seeing the individual sound generators

101
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:28,749
that make noises very similar to what

102
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:32,879
exists in my landscape in rural Virginia

103
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,119
so to move on from that I'm gonna show

104
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,909
you another similar kind of work but in

105
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:43,438
this case I'm looking at Birds

106
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,610
[Music]

107
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,289
[Music]

108
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,939
alright so jumping back in time this is

109
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,469
where I started I have a kind of mixed

110
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:16,959
background I've always ever been a fine

111
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,499
artist

112
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:20,259
I've always ever been a nature freak I

113
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:23,259
also had a hard time kind of figuring

114
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,999
out like where I fit in because I really

115
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:27,819
wanted to integrate art and science

116
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,740
because I am both and I'm passionate

117
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,610
about both so in 1998 I went to the MIT

118
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,550
Media Lab rhetoric and didn't really

119
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,729
have a lot of technical skills so it was

120
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,529
definitely like learning by the fire

121
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:44,919
hose but what I started with was taking

122
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:46,569
apart things that other people had built

123
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:48,610
and I migrated or I was attracted to

124
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,669
things that seemed lifelike so this is

125
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:55,449
the anatomy of a Furby and I went on to

126
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,759
make a piece this is me standing at the

127
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,379
Center for Advanced visual studies

128
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,180
looking at a large sculpture that I

129
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,879
built with 400 reprogrammed Furbies

130
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,559
where I used the

131
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:09,669
and mouths is water molecules to make a

132
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:13,559
piece called the pool and the furbies

133
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,439
would wake up and start chattering when

134
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,849
you would stand in front of them so this

135
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,309
would literally reflect your image and

136
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:22,659
this was a part of an overall

137
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:25,049
installation I called reflection loop

138
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:27,609
built together with engineer Stephen

139
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:30,748
gray so I'll play a short

140
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:49,639
sorry the audio there but the the the

141
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,400
sound of all those Furby motors

142
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,860
mirroring your body really did sound

143
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,330
like water it was crazy it was very cool

144
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,000
so as I said I worked with an engineer

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,090
Steven gray to reprogram all of these

146
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,860
Furbies because I did not have the

147
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,629
technical skills at the time to do it

148
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:12,169
myself I did go on and work

149
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:17,180
independently on a show called live Pelt

150
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,659
where I trapped 64 used Tickle Me Elmo's

151
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:23,330
on eBay and made a coat that giggles and

152
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:30,139
Quivers when you touch yourself so but

153
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,140
but there so and I and those yeah I mean

154
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,969
I I love that work and I was proud of it

155
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,549
but I but I still felt like you know

156
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,919
what what is so I'm looking at these

157
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,559
electronic creatures I'm trying to kind

158
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,269
of ask you know where is the spark of

159
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:46,670
life what is electricity mean as a

160
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,850
creative medium but I still did not have

161
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,339
the skills to dig into it myself and so

162
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,100
I put this image up on the screen just

163
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,140
to say like this is sort of me like in

164
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,690
this fantasy world of you know I just

165
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,269
want you know electronics and nature and

166
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:03,949
electricity in nature like I just want

167
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:06,050
to integrate it all that was what I was

168
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,570
really inspired to do so I set out to

169
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,550
teach myself analog electrical

170
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,860
engineering and this is kind of what

171
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,870
happened I I built lots and lots of

172
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,529
really bad circuits okay I'm sure some

173
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,420
of you can understand or relate to that

174
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,060
it was ten years that I worked on doing

175
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,519
this and that led me these are details

176
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,829
but I chose these details cuz I just

177
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:32,510
wanted to show you how like heavily

178
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,360
works the surfaces were this was for

179
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,279
show that I did called the parallel

180
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,160
series and hopefully you get the pun

181
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,870
there right and I were I was trying to

182
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,769
like integrate electronics and painting

183
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:50,899
but as I was building my circuits like

184
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,470
blink LEDs or

185
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,590
or may cricket like sounds I would break

186
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,720
as many of them are actually many more

187
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,030
of them than I would successfully build

188
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,970
and so I used that detritus just like

189
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,760
Leafs or mulch material and like just

190
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,770
worked it into the surface of the canvas

191
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,090
and left it there because it was like a

192
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,950
kind of a natural process in and of

193
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,280
itself it was imperfect but so is nature

194
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,430
right so it's like this growth process

195
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,240
but out of that I also learned that

196
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,050
indeed documentation is absolutely

197
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,830
critical because I needed to be able to

198
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,840
go back and repair these circuits or

199
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,790
tweak them or or build other circuits

200
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,420
with similar qualities and so this was

201
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,040
one of the first pieces that I actually

202
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,910
let me play this little video here it's

203
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,030
kind of faint but you'll hear this like

204
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,520
bird crying in the distance and then

205
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,870
there's this annoying click because that

206
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,460
click oh God

207
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,580
drove me crazy and so I wrote I wrote in

208
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,080
the lower right hand because you know

209
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,160
and I couldn't get rid of it because I

210
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,300
just didn't I wasn't a good enough

211
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,090
electrical engineer to just build any

212
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,070
sound I wanted to like I had to work

213
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,810
really hard to get an effect and then

214
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,720
you know sometimes it wasn't perfect but

215
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,610
I had to let that continue to be part of

216
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,820
my artistic practice because it's real

217
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,770
you know that's that's where I was this

218
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,420
is what I was doing I was taking a lot

219
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,000
of risk into my practice and sometimes

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,950
it failed so I'm just gonna read you a

221
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,600
little quote from the lower right hand

222
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,810
corner I said I'm pretty sure that this

223
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,970
circuit contains unnecessary parts and

224
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,550
possibly bad engineering I do not aim

225
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,860
for efficiency but effect therefore my

226
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,390
chief complaint is the click between

227
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,140
cries which I was unable to resolve and

228
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,810
then I ended up by saying I need to

229
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,550
document these circuits for my own

230
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,550
sanity which was true because by

231
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,290
documenting them and then going on in

232
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,089
building other things I kind of that was

233
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:53,070
how I was able to figure out like okay

234
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,720
where is that clip coming from and how

235
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,970
do I get rid of it or how do I take this

236
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,880
bird call and turn it into like a frog

237
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,600
or whatever

238
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,089
as I began getting you know better in my

239
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:10,269
engineering skills I moved on to

240
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:12,160
building my own circuits these were

241
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,939
etched on a flexible substrate I just I

242
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:17,559
did them myself with Fork ferric

243
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,999
chloride at home and made another one of

244
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:24,459
these what I call electro Lear's so this

245
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:28,449
was the first one that I made of the

246
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:33,129
night time and then from there I moved

247
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:36,819
on to look at bees and it was you know

248
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:38,559
partly because I wanted to look at just

249
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,749
like a different insect but but also

250
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:42,519
because I was really concerned about

251
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,470
what's going on with ecology and the

252
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,360
role that electricity and the

253
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,040
empowerment of humans and how that's

254
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,399
affecting our environment I'll play you

255
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:57,069
this little video so what I did here was

256
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:00,249
I wanted to make ease that we're flying

257
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:02,860
around but I couldn't figure out how to

258
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,709
make the bees miniature enough so I

259
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:09,670
suspended like little sculptural piece

260
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,670
on this very delicate Mogi oh and then I

261
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,540
had like tiny

262
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,850
little motors that people use for arson

263
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,000
claims and I just suspended them within

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,880
this like mobile matrix and everything

265
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,470
just kind of like jiggled and moved

266
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,830
around and look feet right

267
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,940
the controller circuitry for the bees

268
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,470
was in the piece of paper that is on the

269
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,540
bottom underneath of the tree and then

270
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,850
the wires all grew up the tree and and

271
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,020
fed the bee structure and and that you

272
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,010
know and that kind of thing really

273
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,510
appeals to me because that's how you

274
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,100
know to me that's what nature looks like

275
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,570
and feels like you know you have this

276
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,250
electricity just running through it I

277
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,620
love that and then the other images that

278
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:59,640
I put here so in my engagement with

279
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,660
electrical engineering and all these

280
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,360
different discrete components spending

281
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,860
so much time with them they really took

282
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,170
on personality for me as an artist and

283
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,690
and it was like you know I wanted to

284
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,839
engage this theme of like electronics

285
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,700
you know being lifelike as they are

286
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,800
we're kind of becoming us and that we're

287
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,110
sort of becoming them and so I made

288
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,200
these large like human scale electronic

289
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,270
components and staged them in a New York

290
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,770
gallery which sadly I'm not sure many

291
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,300
people in my audience even like

292
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,360
recognized them as such but it made me

293
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,750
feel good I I liked them

294
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,820
so moving on from there I wanted you

295
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,620
know again like birds are more

296
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,709
complicated than then crickets and bees

297
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:48,100
for example and so I was looking at

298
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,430
other species of animals this little guy

299
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:57,180
here is a gray tree frog that I made

300
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,600
and the way that I did this was to paint

301
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,970
a watercolor of the tree frog and then

302
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,950
again to build the circuit into the

303
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,650
surface of of the paper and I loved that

304
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,170
mixture of the traditional fine art

305
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:26,350
medium with the electronic media so at

306
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,120
this point I you know I was able to

307
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,920
achieve some effects and that was cool

308
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,960
but I was still really limited and what

309
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,480
I could do I still am really limited and

310
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,960
what I could do and so I wanted to look

311
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:43,030
at like strong Stern okay you know what

312
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,810
you know when I'm listening to a bird

313
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,910
what what exactly am i hearing you know

314
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,790
like how okay how can I get better at

315
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,460
this like what's what's the path for me

316
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,860
to listen to that sound and look at that

317
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,160
sound and then build it and I don't come

318
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,670
from an audio engineering background so

319
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,290
you know I don't know maybe like some of

320
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,760
you have the answer to that please come

321
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,320
up and talk to me afterwards but um but

322
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,060
so for me you know this is this is sort

323
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,980
of what I figured out so looking at the

324
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,750
structure of sound like what is it how

325
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,120
do I think about it and this and so you

326
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,340
know first I asked myself okay like

327
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,900
what's the basic structure that I'm

328
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,190
hearing and I'm sure many of you have

329
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,800
listened to like waveform primitive so

330
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,510
you kind of know like that a sine wave

331
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,580
sounds different than a square wave in a

332
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,860
triangle wave and so forth right so I

333
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,360
start there and I say like what's the

334
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,090
basic waveform and then of course you

335
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,970
know what's the frequency or the pitch

336
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,360
like how high or low is it how loud is

337
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,320
it and you know and then what's the

338
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,440
texture right because I mean but I you

339
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,140
know just basic waveforms are not

340
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,490
particularly interesting like there's

341
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,200
always some sort of texture overlaying

342
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,390
it and then finally like what's the

343
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,430
structure of it so in the case of that

344
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,930
gray tree frog you know that kind of

345
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:08,460
goes with you know that that's the the

346
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,400
the the the Sawtooth wave overlaid on

347
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,980
this sine wave of texture that's

348
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,630
creating the envelope and therefore you

349
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,119
get that that kind of you know more

350
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,280
interesting sound to some structure to

351
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,250
it so how do I do this

352
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,890
these are a couple different circuits

353
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,650
that I use all of the time the one

354
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,350
that's my absolute most favorite and I

355
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,690
use it all the time is an a stable

356
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,790
multivibrator I love it because it's so

357
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,790
simple you know you can you can build

358
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,910
one just with like very low costs easily

359
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,030
available capacitors resistors

360
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,060
transistors if I break something it

361
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,740
doesn't really matter you know I'm not

362
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,400
breaking something really expensive and

363
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,690
what I do is I daisy chain them so I I

364
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,720
have I have found that if I take so one

365
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,450
a stable multivibrator oscillator any

366
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,240
oscillator isn't very interesting

367
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,860
because you're just gonna get your LEDs

368
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,620
going blink blink blink blink blink

369
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,810
right back and forth so okay that's kind

370
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,680
of boring well so what I do and this is

371
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,930
just a simple example this is this is a

372
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,420
circuit that's on my hackaday page under

373
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,430
hacking nature's musicians so you can go

374
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,650
and play with us if you want to but I'm

375
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,720
using this simple example to show you

376
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
like where I'm creating the tempo of the

377
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,100
pitch and then the filter amplifier but

378
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,750
just focusing on the tempo and the pitch

379
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,720
because those are my two oscillators

380
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,910
that I have in this circuit what I'm

381
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,140
doing is for the pitch the oscillator

382
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,930
I'm just finding like one point in that

383
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,510
circuit that I can control with another

384
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,250
oscillator I mean it's really that

385
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,350
simple so I just basically I build these

386
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,690
a stable multi vibrators and then I say

387
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,670
like where can I find a point in this

388
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,990
circuit that I can control from

389
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,950
somewhere else

390
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,140
and I just keep doing that and I found

391
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,510
that if I build up like like five

392
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,310
oscillators that are connected to each

393
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,140
other and controlling each other I can

394
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,560
get really really complex sounds with a

395
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,430
very very low cost

396
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,510
easily available part so I'm just going

397
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,639
like show you me I take these videos of

398
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:21,230
myself playing with my breadboard you

399
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,880
can watch them on my Vimeo page and it's

400
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,100
cool to see how much exchanges with very

401
00:19:28,100 --> 00:20:09,980
minimal so I spend hours doing this and

402
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,269
that's how I figure out how to make

403
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:14,389
these animal sounds and if you go like I

404
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:16,309
said on my hack today page you can find

405
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:17,750
some schematics and some basic

406
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,700
guidelines and anybody can do this and

407
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,070
you may not want to make animal sounds

408
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,080
but it's a great way to make you know if

409
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,880
you're if you're a musician or you want

410
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,220
to add sound effects like you know just

411
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,470
build some like hardware oscillators and

412
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,120
tie them together in different ways and

413
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,380
if you break something it's no big deal

414
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,049
you just blown out like a you know a 30

415
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:38,960
cent transistor it's just you know it's

416
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,669
not that stressful I guess the other

417
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:44,990
thing that I encourage you to play with

418
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,049
is your speakers because the design of

419
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:51,889
the speaker matters tremendously in the

420
00:20:51,889 --> 00:21:00,470
sound quality so this is just a little

421
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,269
piezo electric disc I also have

422
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:04,159
instructions on my hackaday page about

423
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,510
how to build your own piezo electric

424
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,919
speakers obviously you know an 8 ohm

425
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,750
speaker is gonna give you different

426
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,460
results but it's the same principle like

427
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,620
mess around with it and you can change

428
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,539
you know change your sound quality

429
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:18,950
pretty considerably and I think that's

430
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,460
cool

431
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,440
you know low cost so moving on from that

432
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,120
so sequencing these sounds so if you

433
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,500
have a cricket that's just chirping like

434
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,520
non-stop that's super annoying right

435
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,050
you have to sequence them in some way

436
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,930
and this is just like a basic concept of

437
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,700
how I do it

438
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,520
you got us generate a signal some sort

439
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,830
of randomness it doesn't have to be true

440
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,010
randomness it can be pseudo randomness

441
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,570
but I like for example like a transistor

442
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,690
where the base is just disconnected and

443
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,280
then from there you've got to filter it

444
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,720
in some way right because if you look at

445
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,430
the noise that comes out of transistor

446
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,380
it's like you know it's sort of like

447
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,910
messy and all over the place you've got

448
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,880
a you know use like a Schmitt trigger or

449
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,920
a Zener diode or or charge a capacitor

450
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,990
or something to like slow that down and

451
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,850
get something sort of resembling a pulse

452
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,800
and then that pulse can be used to

453
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,140
trigger a one-shot timer and you can you

454
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,100
know you can have a bunch of different

455
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,380
one shot timers that are all like you

456
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,130
know output a signal for you know

457
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,140
different lengths of time and that's how

458
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,060
I do it with my birds or my insects I

459
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,400
just set them to different time

460
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,530
durations and then I use those one shots

461
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,930
to turn switches on and off like a relay

462
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,900
for example and that and then the relay

463
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,400
turns on and off my individual sound

464
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,840
generators so you know pretty

465
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,060
straightforward and this is what it

466
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,220
looks like when I build it and I just

467
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,900
think that looks so cool so you know I

468
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,180
realize you can do all this in software

469
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,250
but like hardware is beautiful and

470
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,600
that's something that I really want to

471
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,000
get across and my work is just how how

472
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,670
gorgeous hardware is it's it's it's

473
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,770
magical it's beautiful and it and it in

474
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,230
itself like it looks like nature you

475
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,500
know with like vines going everywhere I

476
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,300
think that's awesome

477
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,250
but not all of my work is super chaotic

478
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,260
at the moment I'm working on a series of

479
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,040
large-scale artistic PCBs so well I take

480
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,830
a sound that I know works well and put

481
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,220
it into an artfully designed circuit

482
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,900
board in this case this piece pretty

483
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:25,350
bird is this PCB is 16 by 24 inches and

484
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,950
it sings like a simple little song and

485
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,540
so this is like a direction that I'm

486
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,840
taking my work you know as trying to get

487
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,300
the the fine art world to see how cool

488
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,970
electronics can be in a visual art

489
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,690
context

490
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,810
but yeah so but moving back to kind of

491
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,690
what like my core interest where I

492
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,280
started from the very beginning and

493
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,830
where I remain you know what is the

494
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,580
spark of life I ask myself that all the

495
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,410
time you know when I see these emergent

496
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,270
behaviors and my circuits that seem so

497
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,660
lifelike it's really like wow you know I

498
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,120
mean what's how can I say that this

499
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,920
thing isn't living like you know I mean

500
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,660
those are like different criteria people

501
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,150
using like you know is it conscious does

502
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,980
it have free will and so on and so forth

503
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,810
but but I mean you have to admit it's a

504
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:20,150
slippery slope right this is like the

505
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,290
coolest slide in my whole presentation

506
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,950
because so I'm gonna show you first of

507
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,360
all I'm gonna show you one of my analog

508
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,440
electronic songbirds and the sound that

509
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,650
you hear is entirely created by the

510
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,390
circuit that's inside of that little my

511
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,400
lower body that's it okay it's just an

512
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,840
analog electronic circuit that's

513
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,610
generating the sound of that songbird

514
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,020
but then on the other side of the screen

515
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,600
I've got some images that I got

516
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,450
permission to use from at the in the top

517
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,950
and you'll see this in a minute dr.

518
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,170
Garrett's tuber these are and this is

519
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,450
gonna video of neurons in the

520
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,240
hippocampus of a mouse okay so wait and

521
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,490
I'll show it to you in just a second but

522
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:05,660
then below that my my friend ed Boyden

523
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,240
of the MIT synthetic synthetic neural

524
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,030
biology lab builds a pirata that you can

525
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,590
mount on a living moving Mouse and

526
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,480
therefore image the neural activity in

527
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,890
that mouse which is what you're seeing

528
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,270
in the video in the upper right hand

529
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,770
corner so let's have a look

530
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,990
so so the reason why that birdsong has

531
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,309
kind of a more interesting structures

532
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:47,350
because I have like a large capacitor in

533
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,299
there that I'm charging so so it's sort

534
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,130
of like sings the same way until the

535
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,169
capacitor charges and then it discharges

536
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:54,730
and it goes down but I just think it's

537
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,280
so cool that I can get such a like a

538
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,669
complex song with such simple components

539
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:02,679
and it really makes me wonder you know

540
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,630
and also looking at this like awesome

541
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,909
video of neurons in the brain of a mouse

542
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:09,510
which is just showing like the voltage

543
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,559
differential that's happening across

544
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,240
these different neurons I mean I'm

545
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,539
really like are we on the same

546
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:17,980
trajectory here and I would argue that

547
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,190
we are but I had to put this in my

548
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,100
slides because um this fabulous painting

549
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,490
is here in Los Angeles and you know what

550
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,679
Magritte was trying to say is like yeah

551
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,049
this is not a pipe this is a painting of

552
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,090
a pipe and we all know that but in the

553
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,049
case of electronic art I don't know it

554
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:40,720
starts to go a little bit like you know

555
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,690
it's harder to make that to make that

556
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,350
distinction because when I make a

557
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,419
painting of a bird or a frog okay we can

558
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:51,520
say yeah that's not a bird that's not a

559
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,559
frog but when I'm building a circuit

560
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:58,030
that has bird-like qualities you know am

561
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,809
I getting back to like is the is the

562
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:02,500
electricity that's flowing through my

563
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,700
circuit does it have something in common

564
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,640
with the the neurons and the hippocampus

565
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,090
of a mouse you know so so you know

566
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,400
people ask me you know what what is it

567
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,260
it's hard it's hard for me to answer

568
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,090
when people ask me like what it what is

569
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,140
it that you're doing in your work

570
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,520
because like I'm interested in

571
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,190
electricity that's in nature right like

572
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,940
I mean us we are electrical but I'm also

573
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,419
interested in the fact that you know

574
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,980
nature has these machine-like qualities

575
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,600
and that we have these machine-like

576
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,919
qualities so it's sort of this like back

577
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,600
and forth I'm I'm interested in

578
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,750
electricity and how it flows through

579
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,980
through all things and that hopefully

580
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,950
like begins to show us how similar we

581
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,480
are to the machines that we're building

582
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,610
and particularly how similar we are to

583
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,040
the hardware that we're building

584
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,180
so thank you very much if you have

585
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,500
questions for me I'd be happy to answer

586
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,910
them and I'd also love any insights or

587
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,880
circuit tips or cool new things that I

588
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,800
can try and my designs to get other

589
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,780
effects because as I mentioned before I

590
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,910
certainly do not feel like I mean I

591
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,530
can't sit down at my bench and just like

592
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:14,740
build any animal sound out there and I'm

593
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,510
always looking for for new things to try

594
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,340
so thank you so much

595
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,510
[Applause]
