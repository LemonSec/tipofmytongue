3
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,210
welcome back our next speaker during his

4
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,550
time at SpaceX worked on the Dragon

5
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,100
Falcon and StarLink projects but now

6
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,900
you'll find him over at wei MO as a test

7
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,390
automation engineer but today is talking

8
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,879
about putting technology in control of a

9
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,650
very important fermentation process

10
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,570
please welcome to the hackaday super

11
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:11,840
conference stage trent fowl thank you

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,100
all for having me here and thanks for

13
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,860
that introduction I'm here to talk about

14
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,259
a solution that I developed for a

15
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:21,050
problem that I had in the kitchen for

16
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,450
those of you who are involved in

17
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,560
sourdough baking you'll be familiar with

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,110
some of the constraints that are levied

19
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,380
on the sourdough starter which is kind

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,140
of the seed that you start your

21
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,320
sourdough baking from it needs some

22
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,170
tight temperature regulation and there

23
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,020
really isn't a good device right now for

24
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,390
regulating that there are some products

25
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,200
out there that primarily are for heating

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,310
but depending on the time of the year

27
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,280
you might actually need to cool the

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,250
sourdough starter depending on the

29
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,110
temperature outside depending on your

30
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,430
regulation of the temperature inside

31
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,389
your house and being an engineer and not

32
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,269
seeing the product that I really wanted

33
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:12,769
after some discussions with friends we

34
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:16,100
came about a product that we believe was

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,870
a little bit better

36
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,150
something that heats and cools and that

37
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,350
was kind of the differentiating factor

38
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,290
that we thought would be helpful here so

39
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,590
the solution was to put a Peltier cooler

40
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,269
on the side of a chamber Peltier coolers

41
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:34,400
depending on the direction that the

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,370
voltage is applied can pump heat in one

43
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,100
direction or the other direction so we

44
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,450
saw this as a really simple method of

45
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,030
having both cooling and heating for a

46
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,239
device like this and so there's a fan on

47
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,879
the inside and the outside the outside

48
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,630
is for wicking away heat

49
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,670
the inside can be cooler and the inside

50
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,220
is for distributing air inside the

51
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,650
volume and so like I mentioned if you

52
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,320
just switch the voltage there then you

53
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,830
can change the mode of operation and

54
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,260
it's something that's pretty easy to do

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,150
with in each Ridge so here's the block

56
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,320
diagram of the the device that we

57
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,990
actually have here at the table it's

58
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,930
based on a Raspberry Pi zero and then

59
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,880
the meat of it is kind of up there on

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,860
the top left where the Peltier cooler

61
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,720
and the fans are but there are some

62
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,490
buttons to control the temperature

63
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,140
setting and a display to show you what

64
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,240
the temperature inside currently is and

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,090
so I have this I have this running up

66
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,720
here I'm not sure if you can see this

67
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,070
through the from the camera up here but

68
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,230
there are a couple buttons where you can

69
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,060
increase the temperature or decrease the

70
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,510
temperature and then the Peltier cooler

71
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,070
responds it will either change the

72
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,060
heating or change the cooling and it's

73
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,620
as simple as switching the voltage

74
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:23,440
applied to that Peltier cooler so I've

75
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,170
used this at my house already I've

76
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,240
gotten a pretty good performance out of

77
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,060
it so I've gotten up to 82 degrees

78
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,070
Fahrenheit and down to sixty degrees

79
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:39,100
Fahrenheit depending on the depending on

80
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,450
the exterior temperature and the fans

81
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,170
that you have to sync heat you can

82
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,380
achieve a greater temperature range but

83
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,260
I found that the way that I have this

84
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,510
currently set up was sufficient for a

85
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,750
lot of the baking and kitchen needs that

86
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,500
I have and then this isn't just good for

87
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,910
sourdough you can use this for pickling

88
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,640
that's another fermentation process and

89
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,400
then mushrooms also a fungi just like

90
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,640
yeast is also has similar temperature

91
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,420
constraints so there are things that you

92
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,670
just can't do with appliances that are

93
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,400
on the shelf right now like switching

94
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,590
the temperature between what your

95
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,820
starter needs at certain times of the

96
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,510
day at night so this is a pretty

97
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,450
powerful device to take into the kitchen

98
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,420
and then I've got a couple ideas for

99
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,140
improvements here that I haven't gotten

100
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,770
to yet but it's definitely some small

101
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,050
things that could improve the

102
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,120
reliability or the performance and I've

103
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,070
kind of put this project on the back

104
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,860
burner it's in a working state right now

105
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,370
so I can make use of it but if anybody

106
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,710
was interested in developing this

107
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,200
further definitely feel free to reach

108
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,510
out to me I'm happy to pick this back up

109
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,120
if there's interest in it from the

110
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,310
community and I know that I've talked to

111
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,650
some of you guys already today and it

112
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,180
does sound like this might be something

113
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,630
that could be used by other people all

114
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,830
of the all of the code is on github

115
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,760
there and the hardware ended up being

116
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,650
very plug in play there's modules for

117
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,990
the H bridge circuit that just connect

118
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,890
to the Raspberry Pi the display has a

119
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,260
module and then there's just a power

120
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,520
supply that's mounted to the top of this

121
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,180
fine chamber that I got from McMaster so

122
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,420
that's my demo thank you all for coming

123
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,569
