1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,720
so today I'm gonna give a talk about

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,020
pressure connections and a little bit

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,099
about the physics of crimping and I was

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,259
little surprised Adam the friend of mine

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,900
Adam McCombs suggested that I give this

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,390
talk to surprised me a little bit

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,250
because this is after all Hardware

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,970
conference and this is a little more

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,090
appropriate for a science setting but

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,279
we'll see how it goes so a little bit

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,309
about my background is she just said I

12
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,829
run a small manufacturing company we

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,910
produce crimp tools for aerospace

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,750
military energy and and some electric

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,570
automotive companies I'm a consultant to

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,739
Panduit teehee molex Amphenol and ITT

17
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,010
Cannon and we've done a lot of projects

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,070
with you know a lot of the larger

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,789
companies like Tesla Lockheed northa

20
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,790
Grumman and NASA and then prior to that

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,250
I spent about 10 years in computational

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,450
physics working on protein folding so

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,020
this field at least you know when you

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,600
get into the microstructure of crimping

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,119
has a lot of similarities with what I

26
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,729
did with protein folding we'll see that

27
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,080
a little bit as we get into the talk so

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,670
the thesis of this talk is that you know

29
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,070
crimping is a lot more complex than

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,759
probably most people you know would

31
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,880
would would think and we're gonna

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,240
explore that a little bit but you know

33
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,979
that it's possible if there are other

34
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,950
physicists in the audience you know we

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,909
could just assume a spherical cow and it

36
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,110
only works in a vacuum I just had to put

37
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,579
that have never been able to put that in

38
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,409
a talk before so all right so

39
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,440
one of the first scientists that worked

40
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,420
in the 60s who's who has been cited

41
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,980
quite a bit he worked for a company

42
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,250
called a ham had mentioned that good

43
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,650
crimps don't happen they're designed

44
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,360
that way and so what we're gonna try and

45
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,450
do is show you what exactly he meant by

46
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,489
that lit one thing that comes to mind

47
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,200
this is a little bit like the o-ring

48
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,930
disaster in the shuttle

49
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,400
you know the thousand different things

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,380
that you might be interested in the

51
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,269
thousand and one would be the o-ring

52
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:43,680
because it's not something that would be

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,650
that interesting it just works but just

54
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,290
like the o-ring there are a lot of

55
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,450
different ways where crimping can fail

56
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,900
and it's usually in a durability

57
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,840
situation things will work in a lab or

58
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,420
when a when someone is prototyping but

59
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,860
if you're interested in making these

60
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,220
things last it there is some there are

61
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,280
different things that help to know about

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,440
the system and and what's happening

63
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,799
through the dynamics so hopefully if

64
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,810
nothing else even if you never have to

65
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,030
have a wire harness made you'll have a

66
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,579
little better appreciation for what's

67
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,829
going on under the hood and if nothing

68
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,930
else you'll be able to justify spending

69
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,639
more money on tools just a really quick

70
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,250
note what I mean by pressure connections

71
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,450
is we have both separable and permanent

72
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,430
connections that you know the separable

73
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,239
would be pinion sockets in a connector

74
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,980
disconnects relay contacts and even MEMS

75
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,410
devices and then the permanent ones are

76
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,040
of course mechanical crimps and wrap

77
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,930
wire and other things but today we're

78
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,579
going to look at mechanical crimps

79
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,060
because they comprise probably the most

80
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,680
popular type of pressure connection so

81
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,299
the first thing what is a mechanical

82
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:03,889
crimp

83
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:06,389
so it's you're bringing you're using

84
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:08,069
mechanical force to bring some

85
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,579
conductors together and the design goal

86
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:13,620
is to make these stable and low

87
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,430
resistance

88
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,100
right of course and then the other thing

89
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,389
is that we we assume that over time that

90
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:22,919
that system is going to hold together

91
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,470
and it's going to continue to function

92
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,070
in any environmental condition that's

93
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,810
great

94
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,900
so again Whitely had mentioned to a lot

95
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,300
of colleagues in 64 the outstanding

96
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,270
performance of a crimped connection is

97
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,300
not an obvious deduction and it's not

98
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,889
one that can be made from a casual

99
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:47,880
examination so we're going to look a

100
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,599
little bit what motivated that quote

101
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:52,710
we're going to look at some crimp

102
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,840
dynamics we're gonna look at what a

103
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,139
crimp system is if we have time a little

104
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,479
bit about testing and then summarize the

105
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,050
results so for crimping dynamics there

106
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,699
are two key things that are happening

107
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,009
there is a bulk deformation that's

108
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,949
occurring and that's in the macro

109
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,900
structure but where it really gets

110
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,110
interesting is in micro structure at the

111
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,460
micron level and there are even some

112
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,090
considerations at the nano scales so the

113
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,030
first thing everyone knows by bulk

114
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,380
deformation I mean when you take a tool

115
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,889
and you crimp a wire into contact

116
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:34,940
you're squeezing you're gonna get some

117
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,020
movement in the in the wire barrel and

118
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,240
it's a mechanical engineering situation

119
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,250
right so there there's a lot of

120
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,300
nonlinear elastic plastic in a mixture

121
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,360
of both deformations that are going on

122
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,110
and there's some recovery the other key

123
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,080
thing to know is that anytime you start

124
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,900
with the wire it already has a surface

125
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,270
film on it it's not something you can

126
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,060
see we're not talking about rust we're

127
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,050
talking about thicknesses that might be

128
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,139
a few microns - like 50 and they will

129
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,539
act as dielectrics and they will

130
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,220
interfere with the conduction of

131
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,680
electrons and at the end we're looking

132
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,810
at when you crimp assistant

133
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,360
we need something called a residual

134
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,820
stress that's going to hold that system

135
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,169
together so this is just a little

136
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:39,350
animation of what normally would happen

137
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,600
so we have some radial forces that are

138
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,720
compressing in the center of this

139
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,970
contact and we have a little bit of

140
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,330
elastic recovering so we have two

141
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,240
systems here we have the barrel and then

142
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,000
we have this bulk group of wire strands

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,100
and what's essentially what's happening

144
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,000
is that you have some radial compression

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,230
from the barrel and that you have radial

146
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,000
compression in the wire and you have

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,600
longitudinal extrusion and then when

148
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,690
everything relaxes again the aim or the

149
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,360
the goal is to make sure that there's a

150
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,470
net force that is still being directed

151
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,940
internally radially and where it gets a

152
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,830
little bit complicated it's going to

153
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,600
depend on the number of wire strands

154
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,419
it's going to depend on the material of

155
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,610
the crimp barrel it's going to depend on

156
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,350
the thickness it's going to depend on

157
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,979
the speed of the tool the the design of

158
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,570
the indenter all these things together

159
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:52,740
will affect not only the compression but

160
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,830
the residual force that remains after

161
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,080
its had elastic recovery so we're

162
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,850
looking a little bit now as I said

163
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,800
there's always going to be some type of

164
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,630
surface film an oxide and so when these

165
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,940
when these surfaces meet they're not

166
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,520
going to be either going to have a

167
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,080
certain amount of roughness that's going

168
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,330
to be on the micron scale and so I'm

169
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,220
just showing here by this chart a little

170
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,140
bit is that when we're getting that

171
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,440
longitudinal extrusion that these pieces

172
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,330
are going to be wiping across one

173
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,070
another and they're going to be

174
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,039
particles of that surface film that are

175
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,089
either welded or that are removed and

176
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:36,809
again as

177
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,520
I mentioned most of the surface film

178
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,049
oxides are going to to be a dielectric

179
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,490
so let's look a little bit about what's

180
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,740
happening at the microstructure now you

181
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,800
look at surface roughness film

182
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,339
disruption a spots and cold welding and

183
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,490
then how these affect the overall creme

184
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,400
so when you look under a scanning

185
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,960
electron microscope or if you use atomic

186
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,120
atomic force probe you're going to see

187
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,610
that these surfaces are extremely rough

188
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,880
and they're it's going to depend on the

189
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,190
metal they get it depend on a lot of

190
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,240
different situations and then what we're

191
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,040
showing here right now is three

192
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
different types of roughness based on

193
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,210
polishing so what happens is that there

194
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,300
are very few actual spots that make

195
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,800
contact that account for the load and

196
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,320
even fewer that are actually going to

197
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,900
make electrical contact so this is a

198
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,880
famous chart that's showing what's

199
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,160
happening to current that is running

200
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,900
through something called an a spot it's

201
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,310
a very special kind of surface

202
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,910
phenomenon that's called an asperity so

203
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,170
we can see here in this chart the red

204
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,200
arrow shows the actual load point and

205
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,450
then the other arrows are showing we're

206
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,550
having either tunneling through oxide

207
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,089
layers or tunneling through voids so the

208
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:14,150
only place that there's actually

209
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,910
conduction of current with very low risk

210
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,950
resistance is the home contact and to

211
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,570
give a little better idea of what we're

212
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,630
talking about there's a paper that was

213
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,760
released earlier this year that showing

214
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,339
an a spot in an aluminum conductor you

215
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,000
can see on the left that the contact

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,740
spot the only point that's actually

217
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,560
making contact is a very small part

218
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,230
about that cylinder that's just a little

219
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,459
greater than one

220
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:51,869
in radius and to the right the

221
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:59,639
protrusion the the so this is the a spot

222
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,480
on that contact and after they removed

223
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,119
the cylinders that was the void that was

224
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:11,249
left this particular spot carried the

225
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:15,749
full current of this device 85 amps for

226
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:19,889
about 85 hours so it gives you an idea

227
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:23,369
it is not the bulk deformation that is

228
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:26,040
making the electrical contact the bulk

229
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,350
deformation just keeps the system

230
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,839
together and in any conductor you'll

231
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,290
have hundreds of these and they they in

232
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,990
in turn are the reason that you have low

233
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,679
resistance so we're looking a little bit

234
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,990
this chart just shows what happens to

235
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,709
the resistance based on contact load and

236
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:49,949
the surface rough roughness and you can

237
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,649
see that with just a little more rough

238
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:55,649
surface with the same amount of contact

239
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,389
load you're going to have a higher

240
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:01,470
resistance so it's it's really important

241
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,170
to know what you're dealing with if you

242
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,629
have a high number of strands if you

243
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:10,529
have a thick barrel how far do you need

244
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,149
to crimp that in order to have not only

245
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:17,279
low resistance but something that's

246
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,730
going to be a little bit durable so and

247
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,689
this is where crimping system comes in

248
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:28,980
so whenever you make a decision about an

249
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,559
application it it should always be based

250
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:34,799
first on the wire then the terminal or

251
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,230
the contact and then the tool at the

252
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:43,079
very end and probably the most important

253
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,079
thing is that there isn't a formal

254
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,389
theory that can predict any of this

255
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:50,670
especially as you as you go up in size

256
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,240
you go up to you start at like a cage

257
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,699
and go up to four art and larger it

258
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:58,709
becomes far more complicated than when

259
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:00,290
you're crimping a

260
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,980
20 gauge to a 30 gauge wire so in these

261
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,019
cases it's best to rely on the

262
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,149
manufacturer

263
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:09,019
hopefully that they've done enough

264
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:11,600
testing enough trial and error to figure

265
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,649
out if they have the the right tool for

266
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:23,690
the so you talked a little bit about

267
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:30,800
wire in most applications of whether

268
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,380
it's a current or a signal you have a

269
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,050
lot of choices over a number of strands

270
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,540
the number of circular mils and it's

271
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,149
going to be based on your application

272
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:45,199
but when it comes to the contact in the

273
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,660
terminal this is an area that you want

274
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,880
to be a little familiar with there are a

275
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,670
lot of contacts that are not annealed

276
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,680
anymore and and what this basically

277
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,319
means is that their surface their

278
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:00,050
hardness is a little greater they won't

279
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,600
go through as much elastic deformation

280
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,970
and what that means is you're not going

281
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,540
to get as many of these a spots and then

282
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,389
they're going to be occasions where not

283
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:13,040
only will the hardness be a little bit

284
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,319
large you won't be able to crimp as deep

285
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:16,790
because you're going to start getting

286
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,550
fractures so depending again on your

287
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,660
application it's probably not worth it

288
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,790
especially if you're looking at long

289
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,839
term results it's not worth investing in

290
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,269
in materials that are not annealed or

291
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:36,199
don't have tin as plating if they use

292
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:38,420
something like nickel they're just there

293
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,529
are a lot of considerations so now we

294
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,410
speak a little bit about tooling there

295
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,250
is no universal tool that every single

296
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,040
application is going to vary it's going

297
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,269
to depend it's going to depend on the

298
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:00,470
crimp style so here I'm showing a in the

299
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,300
industry right now there are a lot of

300
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,790
different types of of die styles how an

301
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,069
object is going to be crimped and these

302
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:12,139
again are based on the application like

303
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:12,920
the heck

304
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,470
the axe is very popular in Europe and

305
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,720
it's a it's a good crimp when you don't

306
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,879
have that much and in terms of surface

307
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,009
corrosion but if you have a lot of

308
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:27,350
surface corrosion or a lot of surface

309
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,809
films it's better to use a foreign down

310
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:33,949
the some of the other ones like circular

311
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:37,970
and F crimp are designed to work on on

312
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,299
very low cost Automotive crimps the the

313
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:43,279
square and circular sometimes are used

314
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,459
for Ferrell's but the point is that the

315
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,619
indenter shape can make a tremendous

316
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:51,470
difference not only on the on the

317
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,829
initial resistance but especially on the

318
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,410
durability and most well design crimp

319
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,049
should be able to go at least a couple

320
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:05,059
decades so you know to tie it all

321
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:09,249
together we know when a manufacturer

322
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:12,369
starts looking at these applications

323
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:15,799
what they'll usually do is they they

324
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,110
have a you know most companies have a

325
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,519
general idea of the surface area that

326
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,999
they need to deform they have a general

327
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:29,149
idea of how much power is going to be

328
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:32,600
required by that tool and ultimately the

329
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,569
crimp tab so what they'll do is they'll

330
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:37,249
start off and they'll start doing

331
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:41,809
tensile polls so there is a you know

332
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:44,480
basically we try to get about as much

333
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,110
tensile as the the wire would have on

334
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,869
its own and then we do millivolt drop

335
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:55,699
tests so you can see by the the the

336
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:59,239
Green Line is representing the the joint

337
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:01,459
conductivity but if you look at the

338
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:04,220
black line underneath it will peak and

339
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,980
then it will quickly drop off so it's

340
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,349
not a good idea to try and maximize the

341
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:12,199
tensile it's better to find that region

342
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,880
where you have a lot of confidence that

343
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,669
you're getting an optimum result for

344
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:20,148
both the dotted the dotted red line is

345
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:23,760
just an indication of the deformation

346
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,060
which is causing a reduction in the

347
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:33,420
cross section of the wires so as far as

348
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,390
testing a testing is basically a

349
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,600
metallurgical process with the exception

350
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,810
of doing millivolt drops and so it and

351
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,840
it can be pretty expensive to do this

352
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,400
correctly so I'm just I'll just cover

353
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,120
very quickly so most companies would use

354
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,640
a powered tinsel machine that not only

355
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,480
can pull two wire breakage or wire pull

356
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,810
out but you also need to be able to

357
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,270
program these two to do a whole bunch of

358
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,190
strain test and repeat them over a

359
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,160
period of time so that you can get good

360
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,740
analog analytical curves that you can

361
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,140
use when you're doing the millivolt drop

362
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,430
and you're looking at cross-sections and

363
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:25,800
it's not a it's not an inexpensive piece

364
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,780
of equipment they they usually start

365
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,400
about two thousand dollars and they can

366
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,200
go as high as twenty then next the the

367
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,080
next typical test would be to cut a

368
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,800
cross-section through a perpendicular

369
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,530
plane and then look at these under a

370
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,160
microscope and the main reason for doing

371
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,680
this is that we also want to make sure

372
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,380
that there are no voids that there's no

373
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,270
way that air can be entering in and and

374
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,250
adding to the surface films are adding

375
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,950
corrosion so what you're looking for

376
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,980
like on the Left you're looking for no

377
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,760
voids no spaces between these and you're

378
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,190
looking for a hexagon shape which means

379
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,930
that you've you've had pretty decent

380
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,730
homogeneous compression you look on the

381
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,970
right this is a four gauge con contact

382
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,200
for a Panduit

383
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,450
and so it shows a uniform distribution

384
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,500
throughout it can be pretty difficult to

385
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,720
get a cross section like this the you

386
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,060
need a special metallurgical salt you

387
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,730
have to polish it you have

388
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,960
acid etch it and then you know usually

389
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,419
the the microscopes that are using can

390
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:45,140
be pretty specialized as well this is an

391
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,480
example some of the equipment one of the

392
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,160
more famous companies in this industry

393
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,880
is called boob Euler and they make a lot

394
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,280
of metallurgical processing equipment so

395
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,700
the item on the left is a saw the one on

396
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,059
the right is a polisher and the device

397
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,830
on the right is a specialized microscope

398
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,130
the other thing that a user can can do

399
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,860
if the manufacturer specifies crimp pipe

400
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,080
that's something that you can do to

401
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,940
assure that you've actually cramped

402
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,700
within their parameters the the device

403
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,260
I'm showing here is something that we

404
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,140
made so we can look at a lot of

405
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,850
different things but all you need is a

406
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:32,540
micrometer well the there is an

407
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,900
organization that's part of the Triple E

408
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,320
that is involved in a lot of research

409
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,990
not just on crimping but on relays

410
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,179
separable contacts there's still a lot

411
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:46,610
of research being done and if there's

412
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,980
anybody that's interested you can get a

413
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:54,049
lot more information here and that's it

414
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:55,740
so thanks

415
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,859
[Applause]

416
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,890
um oh just say thanks to a friend of

417
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,000
mine that helped me with some of the

418
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,670
graphics Adam for giving me the idea in

419
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,360
the first place

420
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,480
and Pat white stone so there any

421
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,680
questions I'll be happy to answer go

422
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,920
ahead
