00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,470
gallery next door so be sure to check

69
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,180
them out in person and try some them out

70
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,599
so if you're gonna have a huge contest

71
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,819
that depends on great engineering good

72
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:07,129
ideas and comes from places all over the

73
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,120
world and all kinds of different

74
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,709
backgrounds you need someone that's

75
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,540
equally qualified to judge these sorts

76
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,489
of things and we're very very thankful

77
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,260
to our judges throughout the hackaday

78
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,660
prize and especially this year we have

79
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,279
judges who have donated their time and

80
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,410
talent to really look deeply into these

81
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,810
and to make very difficult decisions but

82
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,120
I think it's a boon to everyone to see

83
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,860
that they are behind the prize and they

84
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,660
believe in the virtue of it as well so

85
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,310
let's give a big THANK YOU to these

86
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,320
awesome judges

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,719
[Applause]

88
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,699
something new to the prize this year was

89
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,740
the mentor sessions that we offered

90
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,569
during the first two months of the

91
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:47,779
initiative we're really excited to think

92
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:49,879
and appreciate these mentors they

93
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,860
donated their time through volunteering

94
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,990
during these online sessions provided

95
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,330
really awesome feedback to some that

96
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,669
entries and of course the peer feedback

97
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:00,560
was even more incredible to see in these

98
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,810
discussions so thank you to the mentors

99
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:10,669
for their time and expertise I think my

100
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,139
favorite part of the heck of a prize is

101
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,250
it's not just seeing the finished

102
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,529
projects we get to watch them all along

103
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:18,289
and you can go and go to hackaday IO and

104
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:20,300
look at the project pages to see how

105
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,590
they got to their decisions how they

106
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,349
made them how they overcame problems out

107
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:26,870
of the 20 top finalists they don't know

108
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,270
who's gonna finish at the top here but

109
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,669
we wanted to start by recognizing five

110
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,439
honorable mentions in categories that

111
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,270
we'll go over as we talk about those top

112
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,599
prizes these all show off an interesting

113
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,939
different aspect the first is unfolding

114
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:44,060
space which is a sensory substitution

115
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,849
scheme so if you have a visual

116
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:49,270
impairment and you want an aid in

117
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,279
navigating this trades off what you

118
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,599
would normally use with your eyesight

119
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,509
with haptic feedback that is worn as a

120
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:00,289
glove and a backpack in the best design

121
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,500
category we have micro ECG this is an

122
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,240
echocardiogram which listens to the

123
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,889
signals from your heart it's very

124
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:08,779
inexpensive and wearable so you can have

125
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,639
continuous monitoring that streams

126
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,889
either to your smartphone or they also

127
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,169
in their projects showed off heads up

128
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:17,479
display this glass is mounted very neat

129
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,719
take on it for best production we have

130
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,789
the drum kit Anna lauric drum machine

131
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:27,800
meaning it uses random numbers to

132
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,659
determine the rhythm and sound of a drum

133
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:31,699
it comes in a handheld battery powered

134
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,629
unit designed for live performance next

135
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,360
we have best benchmark which goes to the

136
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,610
electronic dice this is a set of

137
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,889
electronically augmented dice completely

138
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,569
customizable they can be used as a

139
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,840
drop-in replacement for regular dice

140
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,730
and are configured via bluetooth they

141
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,199
can also be used to keep track of all

142
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,330
your roles at sound effects via your

143
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,730
phone or even used to play D&D online

144
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,120
and last but not least our honorable

145
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,990
mention for best communication goes to

146
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,120
the laser project this was an open

147
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,550
hardware fast high-resolution laser and

148
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,620
is suited for PCB manufacturing or 3d

149
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,780
printing can we get a huge round of

150
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:20,860
applause for these five projects all

151
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,050
right so we have five categories

152
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,490
this year's hacker day prize since it

153
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,169
was focused on product development we

154
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:27,850
looked at the different parts of product

155
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,139
development that are sometimes so ever

156
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:34,060
looked or difficult to clue in on and we

157
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,400
have top prizes of $10,000 for each of

158
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,830
these five categories the best concept

159
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,900
category is about originality so how are

160
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,910
you approaching the problem is it novel

161
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,770
are using an innovation innovative

162
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,669
solution to it and the judges loved this

163
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,229
project and we'd like to share a little

164
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:51,850
bit about what they have to say about it

165
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,210
with you here was an engineer trying to

166
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,889
solve real world problem help a little

167
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:58,930
girl with an impairment this product was

168
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,630
really clever really ingenious how

169
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,510
ambitious and fearless the Creator is

170
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,360
brain computer interfaces building

171
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,599
prosthetics and also EKGs as well as a

172
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,300
slew of other things are all kind of by

173
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,020
themselves very difficult subject areas

174
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,539
and then the forethought that went into

175
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:21,700
all of the little intricacies of the

176
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,400
mechanics of how does the arm or how

177
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,930
does each finger work and how to how

178
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,479
does it move it retract so from that

179
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,950
standpoint I thought it was super

180
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,720
incredible and by far one of my favorite

181
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,349
concepts

182
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,679
[Music]

183
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,120
and I think this project stole the heart

184
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,438
of everyone that looked at it this

185
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,750
prosthetic arm has a camera built into

186
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,339
it and it uses computer vision to

187
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,500
identify the thing that is picking up so

188
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,839
as the user reaches for it if there's a

189
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,189
difference in the way that the arm

190
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:52,110
orientation is going the wrist will

191
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,449
automatically curve in and choose a grip

192
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:55,860
that's going to be most specific to that

193
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,519
I think it's a really great place for

194
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,350
further research and I love to see the

195
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,230
supported as the winner of $10,000 for

196
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,709
best concept the creator of this project

197
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:09,689
is from Vietnam and is here with us

198
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,639
tonight will you please welcome to the

199
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,070
stage buzzy

200
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,639
[Applause]

201
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,210
[Applause]

202
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:42,279
[Applause]

203
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,860
so good evening everyone my name is Yui

204
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,050
I'm from Vietnam and the author of this

205
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,010
project so I just want to say first of

206
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,970
all Thank You hackaday

207
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,740
and all of the sponsors for creating

208
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,150
this event and gives me an opportunity

209
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,940
to show the world my design and my

210
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,030
aspirations to bring engineering to a

211
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,550
better purpose of creating better lives

212
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,420
for people that is not as fortunate as

213
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:18,360
me and everyone else so I just want to

214
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,440
say that doing engineer is fun but it's

215
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,260
up to some point in life that I realized

216
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,990
that I want to not just doing

217
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,780
engineering for fun but I want to find

218
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,100
some had to say greater purpose while

219
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,530
doing the things that I love and I

220
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,750
really appreciate hecka days and

221
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,280
everything that has been going on for

222
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,650
the last nine months to give me an

223
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,110
opportunity to show you guys and the

224
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,830
world that by doing what I love I can

225
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,200
contribute to the better futures of

226
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,600
everyone that's in need so thank you

227
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,200
very much

228
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,279
[Applause]

229
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,889
alright next we have the award for best

230
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,949
design from user experience to

231
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:15,720
industrial design this award is all

232
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,939
about the seamlessness of the look feel

233
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:20,490
and functionality of the product let's

234
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,019
hear what the judges have to say about

235
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:28,679
this winner the DLT is a pretty next

236
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,689
project that I believe is going to be

237
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,610
super useful for folks who are wanting

238
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,769
to build their own tablets with custom

239
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:37,170
add-ons but really I liked about it was

240
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,910
the fact that they've made it big enough

241
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,369
for the folks to insert their own add-on

242
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:44,699
adaptors for any kind of technology yeah

243
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,740
this one is great it's a really sleek

244
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,269
design and you can tell there was a lot

245
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:51,179
of forethought that went into like how

246
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:53,730
does this concept work in the real world

247
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,110
and a lot of elegance that when it's in

248
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,179
its line I'm an open source standpoint

249
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:01,050
it is truly it's a game-changer because

250
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,579
now you have this open source tablet

251
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,800
that could be tailored to how I'm

252
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,629
developing something as an engineer or

253
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:10,220
as how as somebody else's developers

254
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:21,079
this tablet is not only hackable

255
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:23,850
repairable but also totally customizable

256
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,410
and I think it's awesome because it's

257
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,329
sort of the antithesis of planned

258
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,009
obsolescence so let's welcome the

259
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,840
Creator Timon to receive his award

260
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:41,530
[Applause]

261
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,610
sure thank you and thank you as a

262
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,980
community because I I learned a lot with

263
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,340
this tablet and this whole project and I

264
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,720
couldn't have done it without the

265
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,250
knowledge that's just this community

266
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,760
creates and I am really excited to get

267
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,860
this to a stage that I can give this to

268
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,570
the community and see what people will

269
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,160
do with this like this is going to be

270
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,800
platform for other cosmical half mmm

271
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:20,030
yeah very excited thank you all right

272
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,370
it's my pleasure to talk about best

273
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,650
production and best production is all

274
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,660
about design for manufacturers so we

275
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,730
know that you can build one prototype

276
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,400
that probably works most of the time can

277
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,140
you actually design something where

278
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,240
hundreds or thousands can be produced

279
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,520
and work for the users that want them

280
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,980
and so looking into hackaday prize

281
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,860
projects we were really blown away by

282
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:54,830
how ready this one is to be produced and

283
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,200
as an engineer that was working on

284
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,580
autonomous vehicles this one that hits

285
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,650
very close to home so the axiom is

286
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,960
really cool because it really enables

287
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,900
folks to build IED power machine it's a

288
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,730
it's an open-source motion control that

289
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,280
you could attach to any type of vehicle

290
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,680
this is if this is something that I'm

291
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,200
excited about because I would love to

292
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,760
incorporate in one of my future

293
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,400
autonomous vehicle developments so I

294
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,520
applaud the maker and team behind that I

295
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,260
think that they've definitely carried

296
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,640
through with a lot of the open-source

297
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,920
values and putting it out there for the

298
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,180
community if you look at all the

299
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,240
companies if you look at all the

300
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,830
companies that are working on electric

301
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,240
vehicles of all different shapes and

302
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,850
sizes it's really difficult to think how

303
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,770
the open-source community can fit into

304
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,560
that until now the axiom motor

305
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,660
controller is a true open-source

306
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,600
platform that can drive really enormous

307
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,450
motors and I really am excited to see

308
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,580
what we can do where can we can go from

309
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,670
here I believe that the axiom team

310
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,910
Marcos and sunny are here please welcome

311
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,430
to this age as they accept $10,000 and

312
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,810
the best production award

313
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,850
[Applause]

314
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,360
this is really exciting for us

315
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,940
we joined the forces there's a fourth

316
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,710
one as well and max he's not here today

317
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,620
but we joined forces four years ago with

318
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,080
an idea in our mind that we wanted to

319
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,510
support the open-source community and we

320
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,490
worked tirelessly to make prototypes

321
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,130
that are real that have real production

322
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,370
value that were made to really last but

323
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,380
be also very flexible for the

324
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,550
open-source community and when we heard

325
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,200
hackaday was doing a competition with

326
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,080
this spirit this was amazing for us we

327
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,610
will we get it gave us an amazing

328
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,830
platform so we wanted to thank hackaday

329
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,660
and also the sponsors for putting this

330
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,530
together and and also the other entries

331
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,950
to this you guys are so inspiring just

332
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,210
really excited to be a part of this

333
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:16,380
community is really awesome it's also

334
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,290
worth mentioning today is the first time

335
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,470
we've ever met each other in person this

336
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,830
is

337
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,940
[Applause]

338
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:31,389
we you have no idea how exciting this is

339
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,309
this is a dream come true for all of us

340
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,989
we've been working at this for many

341
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:37,299
years myself over ten years with this

342
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:39,819
sort of stuff so it's just incredible

343
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:42,069
what can come about from somebody just

344
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:43,349
wants to work together and like

345
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:45,579
imagining where we'd be 20 years ago

346
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:47,229
when we didn't even have access to

347
00:16:47,229 --> 00:16:48,729
things you know like it's just

348
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:53,579
incredible yeah from when I come from

349
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,859
getting this far is really difficult so

350
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:59,379
I hope this can inspire a lot of people

351
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:03,579
because not all of us can have like a

352
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:09,220
same-day shipping so we go through huge

353
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,509
customs travels so I hope this can

354
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:16,720
inspire a lot of people so thank you

355
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,049
very much

356
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,609
[Applause]

357
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,120
alright next we have the best benchmark

358
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,370
award which is talking about sort of

359
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,110
competitive analysis and where this

360
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,390
project matches up with the rest of the

361
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,760
solutions on the market let's hear what

362
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,809
the judges have to say about this Robbo

363
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,630
provides a really elegant solution that

364
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,660
is well tested with blind and visually

365
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,850
impaired community is extremely

366
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,650
important and valuable he was able to

367
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,220
take technology and create a product

368
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,990
that actually could be used to help

369
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,929
people input and continue and learn

370
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:07,270
Braille it seems like very early on his

371
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,480
career so I was very impressed by the

372
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,620
not only the the work that he was able

373
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,460
to do but the the entire package of how

374
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,190
he presented his work it's simple yet

375
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,140
it's something that it's creative in the

376
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,640
sense that we just don't have things

377
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:35,140
like that on the market today with the

378
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,419
falling rates of Braille literacy knobos

379
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:39,340
using technology to change the game and

380
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,049
help turn those numbers around so we're

381
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:43,270
really excited to welcome Gary to the

382
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,090
stage to accept his award

383
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:55,910
[Applause]

384
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,960
do you want to save you yeah alright so

385
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,550
first of all I just want to thank

386
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,890
hackaday for providing this amazing

387
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,260
opportunity for makers like me to take

388
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,840
their project to the next level as

389
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,270
someone who's turning 18 in a few months

390
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,130
this is the best birthday present I

391
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:23,910
could ever ask for so I will also like

392
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,650
to give thanks to the San Diego Braille

393
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,230
Institute working with them it's a

394
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,690
pleasure and their input and support is

395
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,820
extremely valuable to the development of

396
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,040
this project and I will also like to

397
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,290
thank my parents as well because without

398
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:46,440
their support I wouldn't be here so I've

399
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,180
been developing this project for over a

400
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,370
year now and while there's still some

401
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,530
work to be done on the software side the

402
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,350
hardware is ready for manufacture and my

403
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,030
hope is to bring this product to the

404
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,470
hands of the visually impaired students

405
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,660
all around the world and with this prize

406
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,940
I can turn that into a reality thank you

407
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,210
very much

408
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,510
[Applause]

409
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,400
all right so you can have the best idea

410
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,750
in the world and you can know how to

411
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,120
engineer and you can manufacture as many

412
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,980
of them as you want but if you can't

413
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,780
tell the story in a way that the end

414
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,060
user understands the impact of that and

415
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,770
the benefit of it it's never going to

416
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,870
get out into the world and so we have

417
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,910
the best communication award for people

418
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,680
that can tell the story of the product

419
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:41,570
that they've been developing the idea of

420
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,950
the idea of spreading robotics education

421
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,770
through this culturally relevant

422
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,740
character creature is is a really smart

423
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,690
way of doing it I really loved about

424
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,970
that project is not only was it created

425
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,130
by students but there's a whole

426
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,610
education kit so materials and slides to

427
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,950
support educators and it's really

428
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,990
designed not only for education but for

429
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,800
hobbyists and researchers as well as

430
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,480
small cat kind of takes things that were

431
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,970
previously only seen as a little bit

432
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,580
scary a little bit terrifying and makes

433
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,110
it very kind of adorable and cute

434
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:28,209
[Music]

435
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,610
I think the power and the idea of

436
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,710
growing up the next generation of

437
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,480
robotics engineers is when we can all

438
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,760
get behind and this is interesting in a

439
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,230
whole new way because it talks about

440
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,960
dynamic movement for the robots so not

441
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,060
just dead reckoning you program it to do

442
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,530
it and if it falls over it falls over

443
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,790
but something you can actually get

444
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,650
feedback from and work with in our

445
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,200
algorithms and teach realistic movement

446
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,360
that works for robots please welcome to

447
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,220
the stage as they accept their best

448
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,340
communication and $10,000 award the team

449
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,960

[Applause]

485
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,800
thank you very much so that the hackaday

486
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,780
prize it's it's not just about building

487
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,330
a great product it's also about making

488
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,620
sure that that products gonna be a

489
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,080
success it this doesn't venture-capital

490
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,970
we're talking about you've got a you've

491
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,770
got to make a success out of what you do

492
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,780
or else we failed and you've got to do

493
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,860
it in a way that's gonna change the

494
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,700
world in a meaningful way this one

495
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,980
succeeded to say the least so let's see

496
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,330
what some of the other judges had to say

497
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,010
when it comes to open source hardware

498
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,690
your kit really takes the cake because

499
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,640
now you have this hardware device that

500
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,740
you can adapt to a wide variety of

501
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,620
different use cases versatility and the

502
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,150
flexibility of being able to do that

503
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,040
it's really amazing it really is more

504
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,840
than just a product it's an ecosystem

505
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,390
and I think the team behind the product

506
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,040
was actually really able to put together

507
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,010
lots of different scenarios and I think

508
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,020
that the uses are going to be just

509
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,210
endless definitely deserving to be the

510
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,010
grand prize winner others are growing

511
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,840
awareness with the climate crisis and

512
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,850
Plastics pollution is great to see a

513
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,610
project that's providing a tool that

514
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,190
allows people to go beyond awareness

515
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,350
into action congratulations to the field

516
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,060
kit team for winning a prize your

517
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,820
project is truly special and looking

518
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,290
forward to future work from your team

519
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,140

[Music]

521
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,410
the field cat team did an amazing job on

522
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,760
their product they did an incredible

523
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,130
effort incredible level of effort

524
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,710
integrating some very difficult

525
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,320
subsystems the product itself they did

526
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,850
so much research to make sure it would

527
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,100
be a success in the marketplace and then

528
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,660
the impact that this can have on the

529
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,530
world is just immense so please join me

530
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,450
in welcoming to the stage the field kit

531
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,680
team to accept the reward

532
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,609
[Applause]

533
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:16,870
I you know I want to think thank

534
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,030
everybody involved every the community

535
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,130
here the hackaday Team the design lab

536
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,890
team all the judges this is this is

537
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,590
really amazing we're a non-profit so

538
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,750
something like this goes at an absolute

539
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,480
long way and we we really deeply care

540
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,100
about what we're building it's something

541
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,630
that we'd been working on for a very

542
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,180
long time and and we work in communities

543
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,550
all over the world and and the truth is

544
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,260
scientific tools are just too expensive

545
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,330
for all but you know the most wealthy

546
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,310
scientists or or the universities here

547
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,170
in the US and so for us to be able to

548
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,570
create something that can can can make

549
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,610
scientifically relevant data available

550
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,770
for everyone that's an amazing thing so

551
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,930
I definitely want to thank the team here

552
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,950
and the people who couldn't make it

553
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,220
that's that's working really hard on

554
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,590
making field kit a reality and and it

555
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,630
you know I just the only the other thing

556
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,740
I want to say is that the hackaday

557
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,390
community is just such an amazing

558
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,820
community you know this time last year

559
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,680
we just we got a grant that allowed us

560
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,900
to take field kit to the place it is

561
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,860
today and you know the Friday night of

562
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,190
the hackaday party last year we had a

563
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,960
conversation with Bradley and basically

564
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,990
decided to hire Bradley here and you

565
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,580
know Chris gamble who you heard talking

566
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,500
earlier came on and helped us with a

567
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,000
bunch of stuff and so we wouldn't be

568
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,560
here without the heck of a community so

569
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,220
thank you very much

570
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:52,490
ah amazing I love that project it's

571
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,059
really easy to get caught up in 125,000

572
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:57,620
dollar grand prize right and it's really

573
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,120
easy to get caught up in all of these

574
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,549
top projects but the thing that we have

575
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,799
to remember is the point of this is to

576
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:06,499
get more people involved in working on

577
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:08,360
solving problems it's to get more people

578
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,860
to think about engineering and to think

579
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,509
about pushing their own skills because

580
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:13,220
you can accomplish a lot more than you

581
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,110
think you can when you run into problems

582
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,879
you find there's things that you don't

583
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:19,279
know there are people like the mentors

584
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,929
for the hackaday Prize or the judges of

585
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:22,909
the ocular prize or anyone in the

586
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,259
audience or anyone watching on the

587
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:25,999
livestream who will jump in and help you

588
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:27,470
do those things and help you learn those

589
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,590
things and so as we close the hackaday

590
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,179
prize this year and start looking toward

591
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:34,369
the heck of a prize next year I want you

592
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:36,259
to keep this in mind small

593
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:38,509
accomplishments add up to really big

594
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,759
changes and we need big changes in this

595
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,470
world and I think we need the hackaday

596
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,450
prize thank you so much for being part

597
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,340
of it and we'll see you next year
