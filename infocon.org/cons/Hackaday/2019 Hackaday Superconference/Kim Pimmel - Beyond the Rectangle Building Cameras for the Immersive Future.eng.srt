hello has everyone had their coffee got

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,690
some energy back yeah

23
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:02,720
alright so hi I'm Kim this is me 10

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,000
years old with family camera at the

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,119
oshika 35 millimeter so old-school film

26
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,770
you know the physical stuff before we

27
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,080
just had cameras in our pockets I think

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,810
most of you will remember that and I'm a

29
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,570
camera geek so I've been using cameras

30
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,180
for over 30 years and enjoy using lots

31
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,970
of different types of cameras as I got

32
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,870
older from point-and-shoot here with

33
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,370
questionable rave attire to more fancier

34
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,130
35 millimeter with nicer optics that a

35
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,490
you know bought on eBay and then in my

36
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,930
college years

37
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,800
my first nicer Canon DSLR that my wife

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,270
got for me thank you and all this time

39
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,300
learning and experimenting about cameras

40
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,700
and learning how they work and getting

41
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,080
better at shooting how to frame

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,640
something that was good for me was not

43
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,709
having a lot of money so it really

44
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,630
forced me to sort of have a one shot one

45
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,670
kill mentality where I would like spend

46
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,920
a lot of time framing an image and less

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,480
time just shooting a lot of pictures so

48
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,750
I could really hone how to take pictures

49
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,519
whether it be on a medium format later

50
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,070
in life or a 35-millimeter or a

51
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,580
point-and-shoot there's one camera in

52
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,780
particular that really sparked my

53
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,700
interest and this is a stereo realist

54
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,160
from the 50s and this thing is a 3d

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,890
camera shoots on 35 millimeter film and

56
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,709
interleaves the stereo frames on a piece

57
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,640
of 35 millimeter film and you get these

58
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,250
side-by-side stereo frames like this and

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,860
this was shot on a on a camping trip and

60
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,340
when you flip them or look at it through

61
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,980
a 3d viewer you get this kind of 3d

62
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,250
effect so you get the 3d visual right so

63
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,630
it feels like you're a bit more there

64
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,120
you get a sense of the volume they're

65
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,609
just kind of fun you could see it

66
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,079
through those old-school you know like

67
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,849
if you master slide things so

68
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,370
a stereo viewer it really caught my

69
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,379
attention I like exploring new ways to

70
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:06,379
see and this was really a neat way as

71
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,310
someone who is learning about

72
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,760
photography to see in new ways I also

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,969
like playing with lenses so macro lenses

74
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:15,799
are also really interesting so this is a

75
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,220
feather up close and also not just

76
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,620
capturing things that I've found but

77
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,639
also creating new imagery so this is a

78
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,360
mishmash of like Elmer's glue and food

79
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,410
dye and printer toner and soap and then

80
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,120
letting it dry and then you kind of

81
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,310
create these 3d structures that up close

82
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,530
in macro scale just look really

83
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,410
interesting so I took these photos and

84
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,970
took my photography and started doing

85
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,400
frame by frame animations and making

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,710
videos from them and they actually got

87
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,840
some traction online and really spurred

88
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,229
me to to do more so this is bubbles with

89
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:56,810
ferrofluid passing through fluid

90
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,599
dynamics and liquids and just playing

91
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:03,530
with abstraction and visuals that tell a

92
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,400
story through through powerful imagery

93
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,440
I've also explored light paintings so

94
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,150
that's leaving the shutter open on your

95
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,669
camera and then waving lights in front

96
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,409
of it and it captures the path of the

97
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:18,050
delight over time and so you'll get from

98
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,479
this type of motion something it's

99
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,960
really graceful and soft like this or

100
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,789
you can capture geometry with

101
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:28,460
overlapping colors like this it was very

102
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,550
flat and 2d also played a lot around

103
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,150
with making it volumetric so this is

104
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,919
kind of one of the vessel series that I

105
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,560
made so this is using a technics 1,200

106
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,900
turntable in a very unusual way putting

107
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,250
lights on top of a record player and

108
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,800
spinning them around started playing

109
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,930
with this technique combined with

110
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,840
Arduino 'z and electronics and servos to

111
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,940
have them move while spinning on the

112
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,449
turntable

113
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,770
[Music]

114
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,510
really well online collected and viewed

115
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,960
it you've got a staff pick on Vimeo and

116
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,340
at the time that I was working on this

117
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,880
and sort of

118
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,130
Adobe and I was combining my passion for

119
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,560
computers and photography working on

120
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,810
this app called revel at the time which

121
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,700
was basically like Google photos but

122
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,850
from Adobe it doesn't exist anymore but

123
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,800
it was it was really exciting to be

124
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,280
working on this kind of intersection of

125
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,020
my two interest computers and

126
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,530
photography and so while I was on that

127
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,400
team the creative director from

128
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,049
Microsoft reached out

129
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,270
required me to move to Seattle Cisco and

130
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,010
I said that sounds really intriguing

131
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:12,600
after lots of interviews I'm very but it

132
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,130
ended up being this which is the hollow

133
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,199
ones which is a head-mounted augmented

134
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,530
reality computer this is me wearing it

135
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,229
and so basically this is you know

136
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:23,910
putting virtual things into the real

137
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,040
world the first type of computer like

138
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,320
this in around commercially available

139
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,160
and so I worked on the operating system

140
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,930
the Start menu how it appears the

141
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,240
gesture the team did a lot of work

142
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,490
around how to manipulate objects in

143
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,120
space and move them and place them on

144
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,770
physical surfaces so you're combining

145
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,650
the physical and the digital here and

146
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,300
this was you know pretty early days for

147
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,479
AR and VR the oculus rift dubbed kit

148
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,820
hadn't I think it'd just come out around

149
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,800
the same time so this was a brand new

150
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,300
medium that people were still learning

151
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,580
about and in terms of my interest with

152
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,770
cameras there was another product that

153
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,200
came out around the same time so this is

154
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,930
the the Ricoh theta s which is a 360

155
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,910
camera so this is one of the first 360

156
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,789
cameras and basically it has this really

157
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,100
big wide angle lens on both sides of the

158
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,650
camera and captures a 360 sphere and

159
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,910
show you the most most of you have

160
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,660
familiar with that and those cool you

161
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,039
could like scroll around on your web

162
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,690
browser and look at different angles of

163
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,849
the image but it really worked well with

164
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:28,440
this product which is the oculus rift

165
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,510
dev kit that came out around the same

166
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,510
time and let you see the world kind of

167
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,039
like around you right like you're inside

168
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,620
of it and that's not a big surprise new

169
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,839
thing today but back in you know the mid

170
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,719
to 2010s it was a pretty innovative and

171
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,270
new so that was cool you could like be

172
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,610
inside this photosphere and look all

173
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,370
around but something that was missing

174
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,610
for me as you saw in my images I like to

175
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,200
focus on a subject right like when we

176
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,459
take a picture if I take a picture of

177
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,050
the crowd here I'm gonna point my camera

178
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,480
this way I'm gonna frame you over here

179
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,370
right I'm not gonna point my camera this

180
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,470
way and hope that you look over it like

181
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,580
you look over there so one of the

182
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,430
challenges with 360 content is sort of

183
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,780
providing context and framing and

184
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,820
directorial view on what you want to

185
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,340
show right you can't control the the

186
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,530
person's physical turning away from your

187
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,780
subject and so I was curious could you

188
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,760
get something like this the feeling of

189
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,410
being immersed and being inside the

190
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,810
image which this kind of does for you

191
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,460
right like it gives you a little bit of

192
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,750
a sense of feeling like you're inside

193
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,170
the image and I was curious could you do

194
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,970
something similar to this where you

195
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,910
frame a subject and really provide a

196
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,830
vision on what you want to show the

197
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,140
viewer and so I started thinking about

198
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,310
John Gaia's work from ILM and he worked

199
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,380
on the bullet time from the matrix and

200
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,140
that's basically a massive array of

201
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,660
cameras that are spread around the set

202
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,150
and you've got Keanu Reeves here doing

203
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,880
his thing and you're just switching from

204
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,800
camera to camera and you get this kind

205
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,690
of like the bullet time effect right

206
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,010
like we're probably all familiar with

207
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:03,460
that

208
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,010
and so I was like well could I take the

209
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,980
whole idea of a 360 sorry a 3d image

210
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,840
where instead of just having two frames

211
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,210
having more than one frame basically

212
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,000
like creating a horizontal rail

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,260
something that I could carry around so

214
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,670
that was kind of a design goal for me

215
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,290
was to make a portable camera that I

216
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,770
could bring to places so I started on a

217
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,720
project I knew nothing about how to make

218
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,430
hardware or didn't knew little about

219
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,790
electronics and I just know then by

220
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,770
getting some rails right you want to

221
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,450
make a linear rail system you need some

222
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,550
rails and and where do you go to buy

223
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,950
precision metal rails for your precision

224
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,000
camera home depot so so I got some

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,330
shower curtain rails and I was like well

226
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,610
these seem pretty straight wall curved

227
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,730
but precise and the reason I got curved

228
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,830
rails was because I was thinking about

229
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,080
the the notion of a focal point so what

230
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,940
is should the focal point of an image be

231
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,339
when you look in like through a window

232
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:03,010
you're kind of like looking like to a

233
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,870
focal point right and if you just go

234
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,700
parallel it kind of does something

235
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,320
different and so I did some proof

236
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,600
concepts with us basically a horizontal

237
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,060
slider and decided to go with the camera

238
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,470
roll which turned out to be a real pain

239
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,240
in the ass because there's so many

240
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,560
things that I had to solve that were

241
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,000
different that hadn't been done like

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,680
this and I didn't really know about a

243
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,780
lot about how this all works

244
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,040
everything from how to attach the rails

245
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,420
together and make sure they're like

246
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,550
vertically stacked just right so that if

247
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,740
I made some bearings slide along they

248
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,490
would slide accurately and precisely

249
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,650
using the wrong design tools to design

250
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,570
the carriage that rolls back and forth

251
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,940
so this is cinema 4d which is typically

252
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,970
used for VFX not for manifold 3d

253
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,400
modeling but I made do with tools that I

254
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,940
knew and was able to make some carriage

255
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,730
components here so here you can see some

256
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,620
iteration on the carriage that slides

257
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,380
along the rail on the right you can see

258
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,210
I sort of have the like I'm using the

259
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,460
red filament actually as the bearing

260
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,100
catch and then over here instead I'm

261
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,770
using some nylon washers to have a bit

262
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:13,370
more what's it called less friction and

263
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,230
so the carriage would roll along the

264
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,140
rail like that and basically be driven

265
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,020
back and forth by a belt system as you

266
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,170
do with most linear rails but since it's

267
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,300
a curved rail I had to sort of invent my

268
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,790
own rail system which was another real

269
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,920
tricky thing to figure out but basically

270
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,510
the the rail the belt rails slid in

271
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,550
between the two shower-curtain things

272
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,070
there and I could tune the thickness

273
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,380
using some pieces of card stock so

274
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,840
really high-tech right I'm like this

275
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,770
camera is going to be terrible and

276
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,210
obviously you want to use a DC motor

277
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,030
because that's completely precise and

278
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,650
accurate but I didn't know anything I

279
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,760
didn't know what I was doing I was just

280
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,370
interested in this idea of capturing

281
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,530
from multiple angles and so you probably

282
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,690
ask yourself and I know now maybe I

283
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,160
should have used some more precision

284
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,530
like RC you know system or an O Drive or

285
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,640
something that didn't exist back then

286
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,800
but you know I was using a DC motor

287
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,060
trying using the tools that I knew and

288
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,320
what kind of sensor should I use how

289
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,780
should I capture the images well I

290
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,750
wanted to be able to capture in the

291
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,400
frame of mind of the bullet-time idea

292
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,950
right capture high speed and so I used a

293
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,380
GoPro Hero 4 that could do 120 frames a

294
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,510
second and the concept here was to you

295
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,310
know slide it really fast and freeze

296
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,839
time because I was kind of in this like

297
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,450
bullet-time way of thinking

298
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,640
and I used Adafruit components with

299
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,490
Arduino to connect with Wi-Fi that was

300
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,960
also really hard to do because I'm not

301
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,330
really a programmer so lots of learning

302
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,610
here and I ended up with this system

303
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,730
here so you have GoPro sitting on top of

304
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,890
the carriage that slides along the

305
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,660
curved rail that hopefully stays

306
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,670
straight straight but curved aligned

307
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,260
okay well how does this work in practice

308
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,570
and I got it working and I was really

309
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,540
proud of it and it's it's kind of a

310
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,080
death machine camera it goes really fast

311
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,400
and it captures 120 frames a second but

312
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,140
one time I got to put my finger inside

313
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,520
one of those little holes on the rail

314
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,680
and it went at the same time and like

315
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,620
that really hurt so it's a little bit

316
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,200
dangerous don't do not recommend and

317
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,620
then also this is a this is slowed down

318
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,270
and you can see the amount of shake

319
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,950
that's happening here right like wobbly

320
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,680
wobbly wobbly and it's not really kind

321
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,120
of staying level so I did some tests

322
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,070
this is my wife Sophie she spoke earlier

323
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,690
she's also doing with abalone for

324
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,670
wearable projects and you can see that's

325
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,460
really wobbly and shaky and really not

326
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,770
ideal so I spent a whole lot of time

327
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,820
going down the rabbit hole of

328
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,750
stabilization and using kind of

329
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,790
different types of was it durometer 's

330
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,370
of material to try to stop it from like

331
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,690
you know bouncing around like that and

332
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,940
remove the shake and I used everything

333
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,820
like I'm obviously not from the right

334
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,680
world to be figuring this stuff out like

335
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,970
these are ear plugs

336
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,340
that's like household weather stripping

337
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,160
this is like packing foam so I think on

338
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,720
the right there's actually some proper

339
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,360
like shock absorber like 50 durometer

340
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,210
stuff even looking at like drone

341
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,520
stabilization techniques there so after

342
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,830
a lot of experimenting with stuff I knew

343
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,680
nothing about I was able to make it

344
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,740
slide pretty smooth like removed a lot

345
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,570
of the shake but what you'll notice is

346
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,370
that it's still kind of like dips down

347
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,990
in the middle right like as it's sliding

348
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,640
back and forth it's not staying level

349
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,580
it's not staying horizontal and I still

350
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,510
had in my mind

351
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,380
3d image pairs so I wanted to pair up

352
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,290
like the 3d camera the the film one I

353
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,080
wanted to pair up alternating frames so

354
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,390
that when you viewed this in VR AR it

355
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,100
would actually show you you know

356
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,950
stereoscopic images but since the stereo

357
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,320
pairs were could be lopsided since it's

358
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,530
not staying level well there was a Zola

359
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,440
wash I decided to like get rid of all of

360
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,030
this work and kind of start over and

361
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,190
this was a big learning for me and what

362
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,260
I did was actually found a camera that

363
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,720
was more suited to the task and so this

364
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,380
is a fuji film w3 stereo camera that has

365
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,630
two sensors built on it and so the idea

366
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,730
here was to just capture in stereo

367
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,130
natively so that when I played it back

368
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,920
it would actually be nice working stereo

369
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,240
pairs and this is the type of image this

370
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,090
is the kind of image that that one takes

371
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,440
and it's really fun to see all of the

372
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,950
midde

373
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,060
water splashes super cute dog and cool

374
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,420
space stuff the problem was is just like

375
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,080
the GoPro I didn't know how to make it

376
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,630
trigger easily so that was a whole

377
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,270
rabbit hole of trying to figure out how

378
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,980
to hack and reverse-engineer this

379
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,040
consumer camera they're hard to come by

380
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,930
and I had to basically take it apart and

381
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,300
do some stuff with voltages and traces

382
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,760
that also was very fraught foreign to me

383
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,619
and you can see my I think it's like a

384
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,569
spark fun board here that I'm trying to

385
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,819
figure out but I was able to get it to

386
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,140
trigger so I was able to remotely

387
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,250
trigger this camera I was like yeah

388
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,220
that's awesome so I got my test rig

389
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,720
going here I got a little table dolly

390
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,550
with a stepper motor pushing the wheel

391
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,829
and capturing lots of frames and

392
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,079
actually worked really well so I was

393
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,940
like this is awesome this is going to

394
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,830
work so I can like start to figure out

395
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,110
how to change my rail system to

396
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,630
accommodate this new design this new

397
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,120
element so I switched from a DC motor to

398
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,640
a stepper figured out how to drive it

399
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,220
with easy driver board attached to the

400
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,530
Arduino in all the ways this reduced the

401
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,030
complexity of having to control the

402
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,770
GoPro because the GoPros not made to do

403
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,300
this and so I can have a lot more

404
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,340
discrete control as I'm sure you're

405
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,340
aware of and then just simple things

406
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,900
like being able to catch the being able

407
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,790
to catch the

408
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,610
the carriage at either end so that it's

409
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,110
not you know just sliding around when

410
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,930
I'm hand-holding it adding a screen in

411
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,970
the back so that I could have some UI to

412
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,390
control the exposure time and how many

413
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,240
pictures it's taking so all of this

414
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,890
stuff needed to go into a housing

415
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,600
because I did want it to be portable and

416
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,210
it seemed to be working out in terms of

417
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,150
the capture so you know super low fiber

418
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,670
auto typing with cardboard cutting out

419
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,730
of wood some different wood layers here

420
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,370
to to make into a frame so obviously not

421
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,930
the most lightweight thing but it's that

422
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,850
the tools that I had available and the

423
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,700
tools that I knew how to use in the shop

424
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,300
how to make a curved back to this camera

425
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,830
was also a challenge so I actually did

426
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,230
some like dado like slicing in the wood

427
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,940
so I could curve it of course they

428
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,590
didn't have a dado blade so this was all

429
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,380
just like manual multiple cuts which let

430
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,150
me bend that over the back of the camera

431
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,660
and make a nice nice case for it

432
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,940
so this is kind of where it ended up in

433
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,340
terms of the basic build so wooden

434
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,900
housing you've got the shower curtain

435
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,230
rail with a stereo camera sliding around

436
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,230
give it a coat of paint this is the

437
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:17,440
basic idea here pop that in there plug

438
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,870
it into the hack hacked camera and it

439
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,030
slides back and forth and captures it

440
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,590
actually captures the video as it goes

441
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,560
back and forth and so it's getting about

442
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,510
a hundred stereo pair frames as its

443
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,150
going back and forth so this is the the

444
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,400
final build here and you know definitely

445
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,420
portability was important to me because

446
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,250
I wanted to go out and shoot so this is

447
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,720
out in the field and it can sit on a

448
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,150
tripod so I can actually carry it it is

449
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,280
a bit bulky but you know it is

450
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,880
technically portable out in Seattle had

451
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,610
fallen to your Park shooting and so this

452
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,380
is the type of stereo pairs that the

453
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,770
camera captures so this is just a still

454
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,110
just a side-by-side and this is what it

455
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,270
looks like when it's capturing the the

456
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,310
sequence so it's basically you know

457
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,380
capturing video and every one of those

458
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,520
frames is unique stereo pairs so when

459
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,900
you're wearing one of these or a VR

460
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,730
headset this is kind of what it feels

461
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,920
like

462
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,690
like looking at it with your eyes and

463
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,850
it's really hard to convey what this

464
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,110
feels like it's like trying to explain

465
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,240
to someone we're at a 360 image in VR it

466
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,520
looks like because you're in it well

467
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,600
this is like looking through a window

468
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,790
and as you move back and forth you're

469
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,280
looking with stereo inside a portal

470
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,840
basically so it's kind of like a portal

471
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,600
photograph and I was pretty stoked with

472
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,940
like how it came out and it in a lot of

473
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,710
ways it was technically imperfect but it

474
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,870
really satisfied my desire to make this

475
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,870
kind of immersive camera that was about

476
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,210
framing a subject and providing depth

477
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,090
and like looking into an image so so so

478
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,810
goal achieved after about a year a lot

479
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,270
of mistakes this is a lot of my learning

480
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,100
here so this is all the prototype parts

481
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,790
that I used when producing this and lots

482
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,970
of 3d printing on a MakerBot 2x lots of

483
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,400
learning about different subsystems of

484
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,860
the camera and how they did and didn't

485
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,500
work so this was really interesting but

486
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,190
it's also just as unapproachable as the

487
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,570
the 360 stuff if you don't have a

488
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,700
headset on so I was thinking about like

489
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,260
what if you took this concept and

490
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,940
applied it to technology that's

491
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,590
available today right like what do we

492
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,750
have in our pockets we have phones so

493
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,090
what if you made a phone that instead of

494
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,520
a single light sensors like a lens at

495
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,890
Circular imagine if this strip across

496
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,900
the back of a phone is actually some

497
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,850
kind of new optics that can capture

498
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,040
multiple points of light across like a

499
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,500
strip and so taking the idea and

500
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,420
conceptually applying it to what that

501
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,850
could be as a new type of sensor that

502
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,370
doesn't exist yet so you know wanted to

503
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,780
be handheld and just look like a regular

504
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,820
phone and so this is just made out of

505
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,670
acrylic and a lot of sanding and

506
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,790
polishing and some laser cutting and I

507
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,550
just this technology is roughly called

508
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,110
light field technology where you're

509
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,910
basically capturing light from multiple

510
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,070
angles so there's a company light road

511
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,840
that actually has been doing a lot of

512
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,970
work in this space around light field

513
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,030
technology and light field cameras so

514
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,160
this was sort of like okay I pulled off

515
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,140
the 2d 2d immersive framed image but it

516
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,610
was bothering me that you could only

517
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,230
move left and right to look through the

518
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,000
window board if you like moved up and

519
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,310
down right like I see just see different

520
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,970
things when I move

521
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,650
up and down as well so I started

522
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,500
sketching ideas around a 2d rail system

523
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,049
to do the same thing and then looking at

524
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,169
how to build that so this is basically a

525
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:40,110
CNC machine but I was calling it the

526
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,299
creative CNC so using it as a creative

527
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,280
tool instead of a machining tool and

528
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,559
basically putting a camera inside there

529
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,450
so we can capture all of the X&Y

530
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,630
coordinates of a plane so that any move

531
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,280
that you make when you're viewing the

532
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,740
image will show you the right

533
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,080
coordinates so this was this is not

534
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,370
finished yet this is still in progress

535
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,549
and obviously probably not technically

536
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,669
the most sound build because there's a

537
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:08,309
single z-axis rail and there's a lot of

538
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:10,919
weight on the front but it did it does

539
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,990
work and it's getting there and I'll be

540
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,940
replacing all of the laser-cut wood with

541
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,000
lumina m-- and probably adding extra

542
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,840
extra rail so I really like this idea

543
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,559
because it touches on a specific science

544
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,299
fiction film that I that I like I'm

545
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:28,950
actually wearing a Blade Runner shirt

546
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,409
today and we've probably all talked

547
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:34,289
about the the enhanced moment of Blade

548
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,000
Runner where the camera is like looking

549
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,950
behind things and around things and

550
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,559
actually that's totally possible with

551
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,510
this if this camera you know got built

552
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,400
because you'd actually get image data

553
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,190
from lots of different places right so I

554
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,590
like to think that you know I was able

555
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,140
to do this like enhance Blade Runner

556
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,049
moment with this with this camera so and

557
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:58,080
I think it's the November 2019 is when

558
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,299
Blade Runner happens so it's I think

559
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,039
it's kind of appropriate for today's

560
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:08,490
super gone so that's about exploring

561
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,100
capturing a framed image with immersion

562
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,350
but I was also continuing to think about

563
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,140
like what if you wanted to do 360

564
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,030
captures but instead of it just being a

565
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,059
flat bubble you wanted to have 3d and

566
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,850
maybe you wanted the camera person to be

567
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,890
not in the frame so one of the things

568
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,860
that's a problem right now is someone

569
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,289
who's capturing a 360 image they'll be

570
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:33,270
in the image if the cameras on a tripod

571
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,799
so they all have to like run behind

572
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,850
things and like hide when

573
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,860
they want to capture something so my

574
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,360
wife was working on something some

575
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,770
wearable projects and we're gonna go to

576
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,710
the Seattle maker fair so I made this

577
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,990
fun concept headset here where you are

578
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,840
the camera person you're capturing a 360

579
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,880
image and you're also wearing a

580
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,760
basically an AR visor that lets you see

581
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,010
you know the the content that you

582
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,210
capture so it's kind of an all-in-one

583
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,820
package and you know just like the the

584
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,250
rail system you know go high-tech or go

585
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,780
home this is a embroidery hoop with

586
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,370
circular playground express to power

587
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,930
some lights basically they're not

588
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,600
sensors they're just lights and this is

589
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,060
some LEDs just around an embroidery hoop

590
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,530
and make it look cool

591
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,080
and so I was a little bit like am i kind

592
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,310
of crazy this is like a totally crazy

593
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,530
idea right but apparently I'm not the

594
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,730
craziest person so this is from Jesus VR

595
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,100
the film Jesus when they did the VR

596
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,890
version and he's got a galaxy VR thing

597
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,480
that he's looking at the content through

598
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,340
that's captured with this and kind of

599
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,650
crazy like I think it's a military

600
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,600
helmet with some cameras strapped to it

601
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,420
and this is an interesting version from

602
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,670
like they from the 80s maybe don't know

603
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,390
where that came from

604
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,430
but this is not so far-fetched there's

605
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,960
actually a lot of products on the market

606
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,840
that are 360 camera solutions from San

607
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,370
Samsung from China from GE and this kind

608
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,870
of weird hexagonal one over here but

609
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,090
they're all trying to capture 360 images

610
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,330
and that extends to like full 360 like

611
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,070
up and down left and right all around

612
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,370
and these allow you to capture stereo

613
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,310
pairs so you've got 3d vision but 360 as

614
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,880
well so what about the crazy CNC camera

615
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,620
that I built well that's not not so

616
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,200
far-fetched either Lytro has actually

617
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,210
been building these concept cameras and

618
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,290
this is a huge machine from Lytro that's

619
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,050
Appling optical an optic camera that has

620
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,670
a whole bunch of lenses that it captures

621
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,990
images from each of those lenses

622
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,940
separately to create the light field

623
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,790
that lets you basically capture lots of

624
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,210
angles instead of just one even Adobe's

625
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,980
played around with this that the company

626
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,170
that I work for with these different

627
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,590
cameras that do multi optic imaging you

628
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,300
can actually buy these in the store this

629
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,169
is the light

630
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:52,600
l16 which is a camera that has 16

631
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,919
sensors on it so this is all still you

632
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,250
know like optical image capture right

633
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,929
it's just capturing at the image and

634
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:03,520
something that you can play back in a

635
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,130
device but what about new ways to

636
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:11,440
capture such as Microsoft tears doing

637
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,669
reality capture where they're actually

638
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:14,830
digitizing what they're capturing with

639
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,240
all these cameras and they're converting

640
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,669
it into digital so this is what you get

641
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:20,799
out of it you get these you know kind of

642
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,740
low poly but still really interesting

643
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,909
like 3d recordings matter port is doing

644
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:29,470
it for a real estate so they're scanning

645
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,350
entire buildings or homes and something

646
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,059
that you can like jump around in and VR

647
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:36,429
and you know when you're wearing the

648
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:41,679
headset you can you know be in there now

649
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,659
all of this data is pretty heavy there's

650
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:45,760
so much data right like it's like really

651
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,350
really high polygon there's a lot of

652
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,929
textures a lot information headsets are

653
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:52,480
getting high-resolution this is a 8k VR

654
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,570
headset looks pretty rad yo and then

655
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,820
we've got rendering quality as going up

656
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,649
people expect like really high quality

657
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:01,149
renders and they don't want to be

658
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:03,159
looking at cartoony stuff anymore so

659
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:05,260
that's a challenge and so the compute

660
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,330
needs is just like skyrocketing if you

661
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,330
want good quality immersion and so it's

662
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,220
interesting to think about like what is

663
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,659
going to be needed from computing to

664
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,549
really drive this we have GPUs that are

665
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:17,440
getting faster and faster and are able

666
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,419
to keep up with what we can output today

667
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:21,220
but I think something like extreme

668
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,190
ultraviolet lithography when they bring

669
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,230
down like the nanometers of like itching

670
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,899
the the silicon will really like give a

671
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:31,029
huge boost to some of this emerge

672
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:33,520
immersive tech and maybe even this type

673
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,409
of like nano scale technology will allow

674
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:38,649
us to create new optics like the light

675
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,169
field mobile camera where you are

676
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:43,600
capturing not with a big you know round

677
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,240
sensor but actually kind of like a

678
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,240
diffraction grating almost okay so

679
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,580
you're in the VR and you're like

680
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,460
immersed in this like 3d space where you

681
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,049
want to walk around right so now you're

682
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:57,880
capturing and you want to you're in the

683
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,889
image instead of seeing the image and

684
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:01,299
you want to walk around you want to

685
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:03,260
touch the wall how do you touch

686
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,270
the wall well there's these vests like

687
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,760
the haptics vest the null-space VR vest

688
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,370
is um which gives you some senses like

689
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,660
if you're in a game you can only get

690
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,720
shot and feel the hits well that's only

691
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,370
one part of your body but what if you

692
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,990
want to touch an object in that virtual

693
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,910
world now you're like engaging with the

694
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,160
virtual stuff well you've got companies

695
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,290
like dextra robotics that let you have

696
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,810
this force feedback glove while you're

697
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,930
wearing the headsets and also haptics as

698
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,420
well as playing with that lets you feel

699
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,520
things like you know objects in your

700
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,390
hand so you're like you're like in this

701
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,870
place and like you're in VR but you

702
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,730
still react like a real person right so

703
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,730
in this next one a bus is coming at this

704
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:50,660
lady and she's like holy and she

705
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,640
like plows into the wall and in the demo

706
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,100
space right like that sucks like okay so

707
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,990
how do we solve the locomotion problem

708
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,090
in VR well this is not new this is like

709
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,860
from the 80s and it's just reimagined

710
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,480
for today and it's these fancy

711
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,430
treadmills and you're like going around

712
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,290
looking at the arcade right and that's

713
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,960
cool but like it's only flat what if I

714
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,730
want to move up and down well you've got

715
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,230
these crazy experiments where you can

716
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,080
like go up a step with this wild like

717
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,840
it's def lifter thing right okay so

718
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,360
obviously it's really difficult to like

719
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,760
get around in VR you're like you're

720
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,380
stuck on one level you can't really

721
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,760
touch things you can't really feel

722
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,290
things that well I mean pretty soon

723
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,900
you're like in this kind of thing like

724
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,690
what is this ready player one dystopian

725
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,730
future that we're in so pretty soon

726
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,010
you're like here and you're wearing some

727
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,110
skullcap and it's like sending signals

728
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,270
to your brain and valve has even been

729
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,380
playing with this this is an

730
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,450
experimental headset and like pretty

731
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,760
soon you're like in this computer like

732
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,560
in this world right and you're like oh

733
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,210
 this is not the future that I

734
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,080
wanted like whoa like hold on a second

735
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,420
like the matrix is not what we wanted to

736
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,860
do right here you know like this is not

737
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,540
what we expected so you know I'd like to

738
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,460
look at this and laugh because Palmer

739
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,990
Luckey facepalm but when it comes down

740
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,210
to it none of you here probably has a

741
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,830
headset on you we have these things

742
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,440
right in our pockets and we have these

743
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,360
things

744
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,730
bags and we look at these things at home

745
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,070
and they're all flat and they're all 2d

746
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,100
that's the technology that exists today

747
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,960
so how do we make the rectangles more

748
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,240
immersive less flat well we're getting

749
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,600
there

750
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,210
and there's the cool-looking glass

751
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,769
display this is a 4k holographic display

752
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,000
that you can actually look at from

753
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,740
different angles and it's stereoscopic

754
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,289
3d so very much bringing that immersive

755
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:43,960
feel to a rectangle and some of the 3d

756
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,049
technology the 360 technology is being

757
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:49,330
used for more approachable purposes

758
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,659
today so this is the insta 360 1x that

759
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:56,559
captures 360 in 4k or maybe 6k and

760
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,110
actually takes from that a 1080p

761
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,779
stabilized tracked image that you can

762
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:03,760
use for your you know YouTube or for

763
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,639
your family images or pet videos so it's

764
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:09,789
basically extracting useful 2d stuff out

765
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:13,059
of a 360 sphere we're seeing more and

766
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:15,909
more lenses appear on cameras I mean on

767
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:16,600
phones

768
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,090
so there's Yami Note 10 that just got

769
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,730
announced has 5 so we're starting to see

770
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,549
more and more lenses more and more depth

771
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:27,789
perception many people might have this

772
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:31,539
and you have this three lens monstrosity

773
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:34,779
on on the iPhone and what's really cool

774
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:37,360
is that you know you've got your we're

775
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,100
starting to ease into this sort of

776
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,840
immersive future where we're using

777
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,630
machine learning and algorithms to infer

778
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,200
depth

779
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,630
we've got depth sensors on some camera

780
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,600
on some phones and we're able to do a

781
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,090
lot of like in-camera processing the

782
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,769
Google pixel does amazing stuff with

783
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:56,320
nitesite and it being able to capture in

784
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,019
low-light conditions and so when it

785
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,639
really comes down to it the the

786
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:02,289
immersive cameras in the future may not

787
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:05,139
be that far away but they're also kind

788
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:07,330
of difficult to figure out and so 10

789
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,100
year old me is pretty excited about what

790
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,110
we have in our pockets and the camera

791
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,899
tech that we have today and so I think I

792
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:15,730
would like to wrap up by taking a

793
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,139
picture because I think that's

794
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:19,779
appropriate or just take a little selfie

795
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:22,529
here with everyone

796
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,879
thank you

797
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:39,649
[Applause]
