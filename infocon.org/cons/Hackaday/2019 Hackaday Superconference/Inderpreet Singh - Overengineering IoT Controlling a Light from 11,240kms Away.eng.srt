00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:08,849
welcome back our next speaker is

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,500
actually a hackaday writer and it's so

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,210
nice with hackaday writers living all

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,340
the world to finally get to meet him he

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,350
is an embedded engineer and he has

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,539
worked for the largest wholly automation

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,490
company in India but more recently

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,600
you're gonna find him teaching at

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,910
Centennial College in Toronto today's

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,949
gonna tell you about his vast over

12
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,660
engineering project on Internet of

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,310
Things please join me in welcoming

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,109
welcoming to the hackaday super

15
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,230
conference stage inderpreet Singh IP

16
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:42,079
thank you hi

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,680
so the heck of a prize is something that

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,440
a lot of people spend a lot of time

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,160
persevering over the projects doing a

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,460
lot of research and takes time energy

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,030
and money I'm not the guy

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,480
so my eight days before we actually

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,810
moved from India to North America I had

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,000
this amazing idea of you know let's

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,920
create a DIY home automation and

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,770
security system IOT system or whatever

27
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,990
you can do to have some sensors

28
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,200
integrated over from India to here and

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,990
then be able to turn on and off a light

30
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,460
and stuff via eight days great idea so I

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,890
so technically I just had eight days to

32
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,369
design prototype install yes the key

33
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,939
word here is install and test everything

34
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,530
this includes the custom electronics the

35
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,509
firmer the software for the connectivity

36
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,750
and also make sure that I don't burn my

37
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,280
house down while I'm away

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,990
custom lit chronics right so I unpack

39
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,159
part of my luggage yeah imagine getting

40
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,640
that through customs and I pick out a

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,979
few motion sensors magnetic switches

42
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,689
relays starters esp8266 and some PCC

43
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,259
3200 starter boards yeah why not let's

44
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,470
make things tougher not already and yeah

45
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,190
i'll be using Wi-Fi because i can

46
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,960
get Wi-Fi routers instead of getting

47
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,300
some kickers to work and the Raspberry

48
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,480
Pi would be my gateway so with all of

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,270
that you extract it and a lot of

50
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,700
caffeine well I for somebody who doesn't

51
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,250
drink a lot of coffee so this is what I

52
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,980
came up with I use a dedicated access

53
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,860
point in this project which is not this

54
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,170
one that the cable company gives you for

55
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,260
the internet and all my sensor nodes

56
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,970
would actually talk to this particular

57
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,460
node yeah I could probably do something

58
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,840
different we'll talk about that in a bit

59
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,180
but the Raspberry Pi actually talks to

60
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,120
that dedicated access point and it also

61
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,540
talks to some sub gigahertz boards that

62
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,570
I already had because again let's make

63
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,730
things more tougher than they already

64
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,280
are and the PI would actually talk to

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,840
the internet over Wi-Fi because if

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,940
somebody when I'm not there decides oh

67
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,190
this modem is doesn't work anymore the

68
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,210
supply of all this access point doesn't

69
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,970
work anymore I mean the company says I'm

70
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,970
gonna change it my system would still

71
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,500
keep on working and so for the software

72
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,990
the communication happens over rest why

73
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,820
not mqtt we'll talk about that in a bit

74
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,000
and we're just technically just sending

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,670
HTTP requests to over from that

76
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,920
dedicated Wi-Fi router onto the

77
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,090
Raspberry Pi we're getting some

78
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,080
responses I thought it would be a great

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,510
idea to learn Python start with some

80
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,790
stuff yeah let's make things more

81
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,910
tougher and with a flask application I

82
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,620
have a wrist endpoints that I can

83
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,230
basically use to blink LEDs on and off

84
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,209
now note that I don't really this is all

85
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,050
eight days yeah and then I have to do

86
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,060
part of the software to test that the

87
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,810
system works and in addition to that I

88
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,130
am using the rest calls from my ESP H so

89
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,670
the esp8266 is sending signals to my

90
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,400
Raspberry Pi asking do I change my light

91
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,040
no do I change my like no and I also

92
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,630
used as a live signal so if somebody

93
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,769
happens to well truthfully speaking if

94
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,720
something blows up I know about it

95
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,020
and so this is what the rest call for

96
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,180
the user looks like it's a simple front

97
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,360
end so I can access a URL set the value

98
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,010
to true or false we're gonna try and do

99
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,620
that in a bit and that would allow me to

100
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,820
kind of develop the user interface later

101
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,410
there's no database here everything is

102
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,150
in a Python dictionary I find out what I

103
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,980
found out what Python dictionaries are

104
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,750
and then I decided it would be a good

105
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,940
idea to use them and then I found out

106
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,550
that I don't know everything about them

107
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,130
so with that this is what it looks like

108
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:01,170
the day five I guess I couldn't find a

109
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,070
model online so I put something together

110
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,290
I forgot that I was gonna use magnetic

111
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,890
sensors so I use superglue and yeah it

112
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,890
it works a lot better than 3d printing

113
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,760
in some manner I guess and my mother is

114
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,220
not happy with me and when power tools

115
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,110
when I started to drill holes in the

116
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,950
walls to mount the new system that's

117
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,820
gonna save our house and you've got a

118
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,580
couple of holes going oh yeah those are

119
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,950
actual concrete walls in India and we

120
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,419
have wires going through them not

121
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,110
beautiful and there's the PIR sensor

122
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,340
because the PIR sensor is actually

123
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,440
mounted on the outside door and the

124
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,110
esp8266 is mounted inside if somebody

125
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,020
plucks it out yeah it may not work and

126
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,430
somebody plucks it out I still get an

127
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,900
alert and there's a magnetic switch

128
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,520
there that Brown thing is actually from

129
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,910
an old or security system and it kept on

130
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,210
working and the last picture is the

131
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,580
makes you don't don't judge me I had

132
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,560
this at this point it was just three

133
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,250
days left and I still had packing to do

134
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,530
and there's an esp8266 connected to

135
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,590
relays and it turns on and off stuff so

136
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,560
where'd is the Raspberry Pi tada it's

137
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,410
ugly but it works you can see there are

138
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,470
two access points which I had lying

139
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,120
around so I just stuck them on the board

140
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,580
there's a Raspberry Pi the primary one

141
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,160
and there's the enocean board so if for

142
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,780
the uninitiated the in notion is a

143
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,810
company that makes

144
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,570
sub gigahertz modules that work off of

145
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,630
solar power and they transmit

146
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,730
information on whenever they feel like

147
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,880
it I think and I got some information

148
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,370
and it talks over USB so I've got the

149
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,169
Raspberry Pi talking to a sensor board

150
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:50,800
over USB

151
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,310
I've got esp8266 talking over Wi-Fi and

152
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,200
I've got a CC 3100 which I haven't shown

153
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,050
yet and all of that stuff talks to the

154
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,860
Raspberry Pi there's a flask software

155
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,810
there's a github link if you want to

156
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,540
look at it and tell me what what exactly

157
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,130
is wrong with it but it works ok so what

158
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,400
about the chi-wai well I'll just show

159
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,340
you the demo because at this point if

160
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,310
you have a rest call that activates the

161
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,460
variables inside the flask server when

162
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,200
the LED when the lights talk to it ask

163
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,030
what am I supposed to do and it kind of

164
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,840
just it has a to and fro about it so let

165
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,530
me see if the video plays please play oh

166
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:43,330
thank you so here there's the website

167
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,970
the web interface you click the button

168
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,450
it says light on yes the the spiderwebs

169
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,760
are for special effects and you press

170
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,560
the button it turns on the light there's

171
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,630
a delay because you press a button it

172
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,220
goes across continents it registers to a

173
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,200
variable inside Python and when the

174
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,970
esp8266 expires that delay it says ok

175
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,950
let's ask me what I'm supposed to do I'm

176
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,229
gonna turn all the lights now so in that

177
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,520
kind of just process keeps on happening

178
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,510
so so what next

179
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,840
yeah I can improve the software and use

180
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,479
mqtt yellow like tried that

181
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,010
so Eclipse has a project had a project

182
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,890
six years ago which was IOT dot Eclipse

183
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,559
orgy they had a MQTT broker available

184
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,900
for everyone so you could connect to it

185
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,219
and Benjamin KB shout out to him he was

186
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,500
actually hosting that personally and

187
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,070
when he left nobody told me

188
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,800
and I had a project that just stopped

189
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,930
working and so this was the initial

190
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,930
project which uses MQTT and it talks to

191
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:00,029
a cc 3200 the URL it's not local I'm not

192
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:02,220
I was using team you are there here it

193
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,829
is a similar user interface where I'm

194
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:07,139
using mqtt or in the other one I was

195
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:09,839
using sockets and it talks to the MQTT

196
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,209
broker and then transmit stuff online

197
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:17,759
and yeah long story

198
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,910
too little time you press a button it

199
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,639
goes online MQTT bounces the message on

200
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,949
to the CC 3100 turns on a light turns

201
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:29,310
off a light dim the light reduce the

202
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,730
lights make it brighter and sort of felt

203
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,889
like a great idea at the time but it was

204
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:37,139
just I've been turning on and off lights

205
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:43,410
for a long time now and this was mam it

206
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,149
was working across the internet it was

207
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,550
across working so the reason I quit on

208
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,139
MQTT at that time was because something

209
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,230
sometimes just stopped working and now

210
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,319
it's called MQTT eclipsed orgy which I

211
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:56,880
googled in the morning to find out why

212
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,850
it was not working anymore but yeah so

213
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:07,800
that is it okay if I can connect to the

214
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:16,290
Raspberry Pi so yes I can use team

215
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,899
raspberry pi does support team u're and

216
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,730
it has this is what the system would

217
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,440
actually look like from a local point of

218
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,740
view so you could use when I run the

219
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,689
flask server the code is available on

220
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:31,800
github I'm going to share the link right

221
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,279
now and you can technically use simple

222
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,480
wrist calls like yay so add another

223
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:51,509
hanky oh it's not showing my team or was

224
00:10:51,509 --> 00:11:11,699
it okay no yeah okay so the in the in

225
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:13,230
the window in the terminal window you

226
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,300
see up there that's where you see all

227
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,639
the transactions happening so I can keep

228
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:20,550
a log of things that are going right

229
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,649
perhaps and everything that is going

230
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,449
wrong so that is me turning on and off a

231
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:30,300
light remotely if the demo is working

232
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,059
online if somebody wants to I gave the

233
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,949
link to a couple of friends and they

234
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:36,750
just decided it would be a good idea to

235
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,990
turn on my lights in my house when I was

236
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,399
sleeping so the URL is active you can

237
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,290
try it out there's a couple of links for

238
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,000
this software for the Python server the

239
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,399
CC 3300 code the esp8266 code some c++

240
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,160
code and MQTT broker code and the user

241
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,410
interface the HTML and the CSS script

242
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,630
the JavaScript code that runs on the

243
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,389
user interface as well and that wraps it

244
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:03,870
up for me

245
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,189
if you have any questions please do let

246
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,309
me know
