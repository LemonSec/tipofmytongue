1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,370
hi everybody that was a great

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,170
introduction so I think I can just dive

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,629
right in and start talking before I go

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,069
if anybody wants to like ask me any

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,420
questions it's no big deal raise your

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,570
hand I'm happy to chat about any of this

7
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,129
but to start we're gonna talk about

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,970
scrounging which is figuring out how

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,730
you're gonna power your system sipping

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,390
it so once you're at your powered system

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,130
how are you gonna just take as much as

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,960
you need and no more and then the third

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,460
thing which I think is most important is

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,960
seeing power so how are you gonna

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,300
validate your system to be sure it'll

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,120
always work instead of like I hope I

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,410
have enough power from that solar panel

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,000
in there to make it run the big thing to

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,640
remember here is its architecture it's

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
all about architecture if you have a bad

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,300
architecture it doesn't matter how nice

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,250
your switch mode power supply system is

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,469
running I don't care if it's 98% if you

24
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,610
got another chip in there that's

25
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,770
consuming like a milliamp all the time

26
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,680
with no sleep function it's game over so

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,820
you have to make sure that as you're

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,379
picking things out at the beginning of

29
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,329
the design phase you're getting it right

30
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,270
and that even comes down to the type of

31
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,939
power that you use so just like being at

32
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,920
the bar at 2:00 a.m. the fact that

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,720
they're serving beer at 2:00 a.m.

34
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,509
doesn't mean you necessarily want the

35
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,670
beer at 2:00 a.m. you might want to wait

36
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,740
on it it's just like that with with some

37
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,110
alternative energies will start with

38
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,830
wave energy

39
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,290
everybody likes wave energy because it's

40
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,090
like all the rest of the power sources

41
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,130
we're talking about it's free so you can

42
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,799
grab it from waves you can grab it from

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,320
people spinning dynamos you can grab it

44
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,479
from people biking but you want to do

45
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,369
some back of the envelope calculations

46
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,200
before you dive into this first because

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,549
it's a lot of moving parts and it's

48
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,280
annoying and expensive second it's

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
really not a lot of power so if you have

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,759
somebody saying they're turning a crank

51
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,149
that's like 10 Watts turning a crank for

52
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,740
six minutes to get one watt hour it's

53
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,840
like that's not a good deal you don't

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,719
want to be doing that so another way to

55
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,270
consider it is the wave energy equation

56
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,619
or the kinetic energy equation we have

57
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,889
here if you put something on the ocean

58
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,280
and you expect a linear charger so base

59
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,080
coil wire on the outside and a mass on

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,330
the inside with a magnet that one-half

61
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,290
MV squared is what is operating on your

62
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,440
little tiny mass that's going up and

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,990
down so if you calculate that like okay

64
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,790
my mass weighs this much and it's gonna

65
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,650
go this fast because the waves are going

66
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,360
this fast how much energy that is it's

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,240
usually not a lot especially relative to

68
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,740
the entire contraption that you're

69
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,450
running and what you might want to think

70
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,180
about is maybe I should just put a giant

71
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,610
battery in there because the chances are

72
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,959
you're gonna be designing a circuit

73
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,370
that's so low powered that you could

74
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,160
service that battery every 10 years so

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,690
do I really want to spend the time the

76
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,880
money and all the risk associated with

77
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,280
these devices so that I can say I'm

78
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,220
running on wind or wave in this case

79
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,020
it's not always a good circumstance so

80
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,190
in other technology I want to talk about

81
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,250
is thermoelectric if you have a

82
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,989
situation where you've got a ton of heat

83
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,160
and you can grab that it'd be great to

84
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,720
run on power forever

85
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,230
volcano suite engines awesome they're

86
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,940
really great but the trick is you have

87
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,760
to get that heat out all these so I gave

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,290
an example of a part that can generate a

89
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,850
little over half a watt but that's

90
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,260
assuming you have a sixty degrees C

91
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,440
temperature differential and in order to

92
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,610
maintain that if you have something

93
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,250
sitting at let's say 150 degrees you

94
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,049
have to get the other side of the

95
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,510
thermoelectric generator down to 90

96
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,130
degrees so now you've got to dissipate

97
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,810
all that heat on something that's this

98
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,940
thin and transferring heat from that 150

99
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,000
degree C side out the other end so now

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,620
it's not a circuit question it's a

101
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,910
thermodynamics and a mechanical

102
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,320
engineering question how are you gonna

103
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,430
get that heat out how are you gonna keep

104
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,560
the cold side cold the other thing is

105
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,540
it's not only if you messed that up that

106
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,709
you don't get the power you were

107
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,980
expecting but they have a thermal limit

108
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,540
to these devices so if you design

109
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,310
something in that's sitting on 150

110
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,600
degrees C engine or whatever and it's

111
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,610
got a 200 degree C absolute max before

112
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,799
it starts to get damaged so if your

113
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,480
engine overheats what happens have you

114
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,798
been able to keep it cool enough are you

115
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,959
okay to keep running on this system so

116
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,940
you want to consider very carefully is

117
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,400
this really the right choice for me or

118
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,020
should I go with another approach

119
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,850
usually the way people go through things

120
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,900
it's like the most sexy covered in news

121
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,880
alternative energy to the least so I'm

122
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,100
kind of following that track the next

123
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,110
one is solar and solar is wonderful

124
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,850
because it's more reliable than the

125
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,440
other two like you can generally figure

126
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,200
out what you're gonna have I went on the

127
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,510
EU runs a delightful website where you

128
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,800
can go on and you can tell it for this

129
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,260
location and my solar panel is gonna be

130
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,380
at 30 degrees or zero degrees how much

131
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,940
power should I expect and they give you

132
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,520
this graph in like five seconds I put

133
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
the link in so if you get the slides I

134
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,340
would anybody that wants to use solar

135
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,300
power grab this graph and it's striking

136
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,970
how little power exists so I live in

137
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,820
beautiful Rochester New York and I

138
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,830
pulled up what a six watt panel would do

139
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,710
for me and it turns out its point it's

140
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,280
four point one one watt hours for a six

141
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,060
watt panel per day so that means it's

142
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,919
the same as if you put it in full Sun

143
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,330
for 45 minutes that's a lot to think

144
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,030
about when you're saying do I really

145
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,940
want to have solar power running here

146
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,250
you're gonna be generating tons here all

147
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,840
summer long not so much in the cold cold

148
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,030
dark winter of Rochester so another

149
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,890
thing I want to talk about with solar is

150
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,979
MPPT so maximum power point tracking and

151
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,389
it applies not just to solar but also

152
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,289
thermoelectric and you want to focus on

153
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:04,460
this maximum power point where the solar

154
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,870
panel sits it'll be in the spec sheet

155
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,130
like we would like you to be at five

156
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,680
volts in order to get the specified six

157
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,050
Watts out okay great so there's lots of

158
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,970
chips some of them you can program like

159
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,130
I want you to regulate your output

160
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,930
current so that your input voltage stays

161
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,300
at five volts that's called maximum

162
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,729
power point programming and then there's

163
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,020
maximum power point tracking which you

164
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,850
set that and then it did 'old its input

165
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,370
voltage in case there's like a cloud or

166
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,500
the sun just rose or whatever it'll find

167
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,810
the maximum power point at that time and

168
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,220
that's Malick's and power point tracking

169
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,220
so this is like amazing and everybody

170
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,659
that I talk to says we got to have it we

171
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,770
got to have MPPT

172
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,199
because we're running on solar and

173
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,009
that's the way to get the most energy

174
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,349
out but all the chips that run this

175
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:46,370
unless you wanted to roll your own

176
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,139
solution with the microcontroller all

177
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:50,330
the chips that do this cost between five

178
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,310
and twenty five milliamps to run that so

179
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,020
if you're doing 30 watts it's like sweet

180
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,539
run it and PPT hundred percent got to

181
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:58,370
have it but if you've got like a 1 watt

182
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,860
or a 3 watt panel sitting on there now

183
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,690
all the sudden your efficiencies are

184
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,690
getting killed by that offset and even

185
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,479
worse in the morning you might be using

186
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,190
more energy than you're getting because

187
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,659
the Sun just rose and you're chewing up

188
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:12,800
twenty five milliamps but you're only

189
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,349
getting five or ten so it's a bad deal

190
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:17,120
in a lot of cases to the point where

191
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,340
putting in a linear charger and dealing

192
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,490
with all the heat loss is a preferable

193
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,159
solution not to mention like a tenth of

194
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:27,860
the cost so make sure that you're

195
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,889
considering all these fancy devices they

196
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,539
have relative to what your system

197
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:37,039
requires here's a couple pitfalls that I

198
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,340
just wanted to note it's around the fact

199
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,629
that a solar panel could be at zero

200
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,190
volts and it could be at seven point

201
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,810
seven volts while I keep giving this six

202
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,490
volt panel this is the specs of the 6

203
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,919
volt panel it's got an open circuit

204
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,550
maximum of 6 volts all right I'm sorry 7

205
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,159
point 7 volts 6 watt panel 7 point 7

206
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:58,880
volts open circuit there is a supplier

207
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,250
that sells that panel with this charge

208
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,229
chip with an absolute maximum rating of

209
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,930
7 volts that's probably not good it's

210
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,009
probably fine if you're just like

211
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,620
building one or two but if you put that

212
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,029
into a product that's going to be sold

213
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,250
that's probably going to be a mistake

214
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,289
you'll get your nail by that so you want

215
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,159
to be mindful of the large swings

216
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,169
similarly a lot of these places depend

217
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:23,300
on you having this huge open circuit

218
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,120
voltage in the case of this is 36 52

219
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,180
this is one of the MPPT chips this

220
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,460
bi-linear they need seven and a half

221
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,070
just to get started so they show you

222
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,599
like in their app note or their design

223
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,380
notes like here we have our six watt six

224
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,029
volt panel running with this chip and

225
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:43,219
it's like well yeah but until we get a

226
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:45,500
sunny day to kick the thing off it's not

227
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,300
gonna even start running so you might be

228
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,620
11 o'clock in the morning before you

229
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,410
start capturing an energy so you always

230
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,100
want to be mindful of like

231
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,530
this could be almost no voltage or a lot

232
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,060
of voltage it could be a lot of current

233
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,230
or almost little current alright so

234
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,060
that's how we got our power there's

235
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,080
there's plenty of power for what we want

236
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,090
hopefully if we did our calculations

237
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,130
correctly so we're gonna move on to how

238
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,490
we're gonna use that power all right LED

239
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,290
debug LEDs the last guy was talking

240
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,420
about debug LEDs they're awesome when

241
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,280
you're plugged into a wall burning fuel

242
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,980
to run your system not so great when

243
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,260
you're trying to count micro amps so

244
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,600
there's two design goals that inevitably

245
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,990
come out of the situation and every

246
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,490
design will sit in one of these two

247
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,040
places all the time you either have a

248
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,440
ton of power like to the point where you

249
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,600
could use more if you had more things to

250
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,640
do it's free power it's there your

251
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,950
battery's full your system can pull

252
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,360
energy out of the environment faster

253
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,000
than you can use it or you've used it

254
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,360
all up it's the dark cold winter and you

255
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,500
don't know how you're gonna get through

256
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
the rest of the day

257
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,620
both of these scenarios happen all the

258
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,240
time and you get to pick when you're

259
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,770
deciding how the balance between how

260
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,510
much power you use and what generation

261
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,580
system you want to use you to pick how

262
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,290
much time you want to spend in either of

263
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,450
these environments but there is no

264
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,070
situation where you get to skip on both

265
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:14,940
of them which brings me to my next point

266
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,610
the be my if you ask my wife how we

267
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,020
track our finances in the house she goes

268
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,530
mmm that's the B we don't talk about the

269
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,600
B it's the budget that you have to run

270
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,370
for every system as you get generating

271
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,520
power using power and with alternative

272
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,380
energy you have to calculate multiple

273
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,330
different iterations of it back getting

274
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,280
back to you're either starving for

275
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,780
energy or you've got way more than you

276
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,120
think you could ever use so if you're

277
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,730
running your low power mode maybe you

278
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,500
slow your data rate down what does the

279
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,210
power budget look like in that use case

280
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,520
or if you're gonna say like alright we

281
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,500
got to run firmware updates because our

282
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,730
battery's full and we got tons of

283
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,070
sunlight let's run firmware updates what

284
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,420
does that power budget look like how

285
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,190
much time can I run that firmware update

286
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,900
before I start to deplete my battery to

287
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,650
a point where I have to worry about

288
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,590
breaking my device so there's all these

289
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,850
different considerations that you want

290
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,220
in the the power budget is really what

291
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,840
comes down to and you want that

292
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,820
documented and I'll go into why in a

293
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,020
second and validation phase another

294
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,250
condition that you have to consider

295
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,020
you're here when you're running your

296
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,610
power budgets is the shipment condition

297
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,590
so you put you design this product

298
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,300
that's beautiful it's wonderful it goes

299
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,980
on a boat and it's six there for three

300
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,210
months and it probably sits in a

301
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,610
warehouse for six more months what's it

302
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,010
doing how much powers are consuming when

303
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,480
your customer opens it up is it gonna be

304
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,240
dead how pissed would you be opening up

305
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,190
your $200 device and you get an opium

306
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,870
like please put in the Sun for six hours

307
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,100
before you so it's like I live in

308
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,660
Rochester but I can get six hours of Sun

309
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,170
until May 6 hours do you want to be

310
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,240
mindful of all these conditions that

311
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,360
come up all the time the other thing you

312
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,850
want to consider is over discharge

313
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,920
situations so inevitably what your

314
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,150
customer is going to your clients going

315
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,920
to do or your end-users gonna do is

316
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,180
they're gonna take the device they're

317
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,530
gonna use it for however long they're

318
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,060
gonna use it they're gonna deplete the

319
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,980
battery till it shuts itself off and

320
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,510
then are sticking in the closet for six

321
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,900
months or 12 months so what's your

322
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,540
device doing in that scenario are you

323
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,060
gonna self discharge the battery to the

324
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,160
point where it no longer is a battery

325
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,730
it's just a big lump of nothing all

326
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,990
right so there's things you can do like

327
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,490
putting in protection surgeries

328
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,140
absolutely cutting everything off before

329
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,400
you get to the point where the battery

330
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,320
cuts itself off so that you could have

331
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,570
you know six months 12 months 24 months

332
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,250
before the battery actually starts to

333
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,290
DES

334
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,850
kill itself because it's been sitting

335
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,370
there doing nothing and the last piece

336
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,130
is you always want to see if you can is

337
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,260
there a way to get wall power to charge

338
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,050
your device inevitably

339
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,060
somebody's gonna want that like all the

340
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,250
time somebody's gonna want that so if

341
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,080
you can put a little charger in there

342
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,490
even if somebody's got to take apart a

343
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,589
panel or something it'll win every time

344
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:54,640
otherwise you're gonna have a lot more

345
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,560
returns from the customer saying hey

346
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,839
it's broken and I'm not gonna wait six

347
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,700
hours and son to get to come back okay

348
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,100
so we've got our power we're using our

349
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,660
power we have our power budget we think

350
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,370
we have a product we got a product we

351
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,560
feel good everything's running the way

352
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,160
we think it should run what are we gonna

353
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,410
do about seeing it and validating the

354
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,720
power I have this

355
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,330
axiom that my clients both love and hate

356
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,150
they love it when I'm trying to get a

357
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,520
jobs like if I don't see it work it

358
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,230
doesn't work they love hearing that

359
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,100
until it's time to release the product

360
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,120
and they're like what do you mean you

361
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,200
can't release it yet you're not done

362
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,240
testing nope haven't seen everything

363
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,620
work and I would encourage everybody to

364
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,540
take that approach especially when

365
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,860
dealing with these weird power

366
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,630
situations because there's so many

367
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,440
opportunities for people to put

368
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,570
themselves in a situation where the

369
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,580
device can't bring itself back to life

370
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,740
so here's for a long time I was using

371
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,870
this really nice source/measure unit to

372
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,090
do all my low current testing and then I

373
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,170
got to the point where I had to count

374
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,970
like nano amps so I put together this

375
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,580
this device and I thought it was trivial

376
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,460
but to the point where I after I started

377
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,900
using it I hit myself in the face me

378
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,460
like how did I think of this sooner so

379
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,420
everybody here might have thought of

380
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,800
this but I wanted to make sure that I

381
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,260
put this up anybody with the DMM can do

382
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,830
low current measurements if you put a

383
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,440
very large sense resistor in and then a

384
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,420
switch that you can flip for when the

385
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,070
system boots up and then once it goes

386
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,420
into low-power mode so you'd like have

387
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,040
an LED and your firmware turn off when

388
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,600
he goes in a low-power mode you flip the

389
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,770
switch and you start measuring the

390
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,410
device really simple I hope I'm not

391
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,750
boring you but I've used it so many

392
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,700
times that I think it would really help

393
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,060
people out

394
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:55,050
all right so there is a special warm

395
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,960
warm feeling I get when I can validate

396
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,690
that my system uses the to my cramps or

397
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,400
the one my gram or whatever the the

398
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,080
budget says and I see it on my readout

399
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,650
like oh that is nice but there's a

400
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,030
firmware exercise that's even better

401
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,680
than that and that's stepping down the

402
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,140
power by turning each chip off one at a

403
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,820
time and then you can validate your

404
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,890
power budget at each stage so I know

405
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,200
that my LED driver chip turned off I

406
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,450
know that my Wi-Fi chip turned off I

407
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,920
know that whatever chips are going

408
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,260
shutting down and watch each one because

409
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,700
you could be in a situation where even

410
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,660
though you're getting all the way down

411
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,700
it's not as you expected and you've got

412
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,950
to reconsider all of your power budgets

413
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,050
because something well everything

414
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,880
together works it might not work the way

415
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,350
you expected and it'd be worth checking

416
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,160
out and then let's say you don't get

417
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,990
that warm feeling and I this I swear to

418
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,030
god this happens every time you plug it

419
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,060
in you get it so that it's running and

420
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,360
you're using more power than you thought

421
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,670
I hate that so you got it you got to

422
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,800
find the leak right and so the firmware

423
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,300
test where you step it down is a great

424
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,410
tool especially because it doesn't

425
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,839
involve a soldering iron but I just

426
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,940
start ripping stuff off the board I mean

427
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,760
KCl matters so you can pull stuff off

428
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,320
the board like okay here's a note of

429
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,120
current I'm gonna take that branch off

430
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,500
I'm gonna take that branch off while

431
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,670
watching the current and seeing what

432
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,110
Falls and then you can figure out what

433
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,120
part is consuming stuff so I've got an

434
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,530
image there of like I just ripped all

435
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,810
that circuit up with a hot air pencil

436
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,360
you know heat it up and push it off and

437
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,370
you can take it to the point where you

438
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,160
can see what each part uses it's very

439
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,890
common to do things if I if you forget

440
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,660
to connect like a solar panel believe it

441
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,950
or not your circuit can consume more

442
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,710
energy than if it was not there because

443
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,420
it was expecting a load at the input of

444
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,580
your charge circuit and wasn't there and

445
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,410
so you're using more energy than you

446
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,870
thought I mean by like micro ramps but

447
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,400
it's still enough to get you running

448
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,480
around your lab for a couple days

449
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,589
wondering where the hell all this power

450
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,980
is going

451
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:56,210
mmm I love this slide because it usually

452
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,280
frustrates firmware engineers to no end

453
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,339
I so in the release package for firmware

454
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,529
I have ADD

455
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:07,049
many different power tests because as

456
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:08,579
I'm sure anybody who's done low power

457
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,888
systems knows you can make one very

458
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:12,630
small change to firmware and have a very

459
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,480
large impact on power budget and usually

460
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,109
what it is is the changing of how often

461
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,269
the thing wakes up so if you went from

462
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:24,169
waking up once a second to once a

463
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,029
millisecond that's a big power

464
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:29,190
difference and so you can quickly throw

465
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,039
it on the scope and just verify you know

466
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,809
are we getting the ticks that we were

467
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:35,850
expecting are we seeing all the power

468
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,190
jumps that we thought we would see and

469
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,990
if you can check that then you can be

470
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:45,169
comfortable about releasing the design

471
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,330
okay and the last piece is validating

472
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,740
all the possible use cases

473
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,059
so a typical charge/discharge curve I

474
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,620
had to I designed a system here that was

475
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,570
charging and we had if you look the

476
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,960
green is voltage and it cut off charging

477
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,269
I'm sorry the green is current it cut

478
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:09,059
off charging before it was really

479
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,130
supposed to and so it gotten in this

480
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,850
motorboating condition where it would

481
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,830
the battery would relax after it didn't

482
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,720
get that whatever current I was giving

483
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,399
it yeah I was getting like half an amp

484
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,990
after it stopped getting that half an

485
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,029
amp the battery voltage would relax and

486
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:25,169
it would say oh I got to charge it again

487
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:26,940
and you charge it again and then it

488
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,500
would come back down and it would charge

489
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,510
again the reason being the cutoff

490
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,299
current of the constant voltage phase of

491
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,610
that charger was wrong and so you got

492
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,549
into this that that situation and so

493
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:39,809
you're not getting as much energy as you

494
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:40,110
should

495
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,789
not to mention that doesn't look very

496
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,549
nice so you want to validate that by

497
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:45,870
just watching it on the scope set your

498
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,610
scope to the slowest way and just let it

499
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,130
do it slow curve up and watch the

500
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,279
current fall just like I have here the

501
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,480
other thing that you got to be very

502
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,899
mindful of is a cloud event so in solar

503
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:00,929
clouds come how's your system deal with

504
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:03,120
that it's all happy running in steady

505
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,710
state and then a cloud comes in the

506
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,840
entire front end of your power system

507
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,179
has got the feet knocked out from under

508
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:13,110
it what are you gonna do about that so

509
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,100
you want to make sure that you can

510
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,450
handle that it's you can use just like

511
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,179
newspaper or whatever to simulate that

512
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:19,529
it's really easy to do it's not a big

513
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:21,360
deal but you don't want to get into a

514
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,519
situation where it just shuts off and

515
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,580
gives up until it goes totally dark and

516
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,619
starts back again which somehow some

517
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:30,600
charge chips do so you got to be mindful

518
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,049
of reality coming and hitting yet

519
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,240
motorboating motorboating on weak power

520
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,259
input so the Sun rises every day and

521
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:41,249
delivers power to your solar panel in

522
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:43,799
very small amounts and it ramps up

523
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,690
throughout the day that happens every

524
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,490
day if you have a chip or if you have a

525
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,330
battery that's like I don't know way way

526
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,570
down if a chip would wake up it would

527
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,190
say you need to get energy but you only

528
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,960
need a little bit because if you're in

529
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,119
an under voltage protection situation

530
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:02,340
like if your battery cells at two point

531
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,860
six volts on a lithium ion it says you

532
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,179
really shouldn't be getting our full

533
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,399
charge current until you have two point

534
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,649
eight two point nine something like that

535
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:11,970
so I'm going to give you this really

536
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,129
tiny amount of charge current so it will

537
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:21,710
hold there for a little while and if you

538
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,940
I'm sorry I'm doing the back from dead

539
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:30,149
scenario I I'll do that in a second so

540
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:32,220
the motorboating on weak power input is

541
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,669
the Sun comes up it's just a very small

542
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,820
amount of power and the battery says

543
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,590
great I need tons of power give me

544
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,840
everything you got and it shuts down the

545
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,179
solar panel like it just collapses it it

546
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,100
says oh I guess the Sun went away and so

547
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,659
it sits there and does nothing and then

548
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:50,999
after it gives up on charging it tries

549
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,929
again and it realizes that it's taking

550
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:56,369
too much power and shuts down tries

551
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:57,690
again and again and again and again

552
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,279
again this whole time you're not

553
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,110
generating energy and so we're back in

554
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,220
the scenario where it gets a little to

555
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,019
11 a.m. and you haven't saved any power

556
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:06,360
in your battery in your whole budgets

557
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,460
way off so you've got to be mindful of

558
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,499
how you're gonna handle that now back

559
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:13,230
from dead if you have this system that's

560
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,249
way under charged and you don't give it

561
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:20,580
enough power to get through that under

562
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,619
voltage protection then you can be in a

563
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:28,019
situation where it never comes back does

564
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,490
it make sense

565
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:36,330
I have no idea why I wrote that inside

566
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,970
last week so I'll just skip back so

567
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,529
that's everything I really wanted to go

568
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,890
over
