2
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,570
hi and welcome back quantum computing

3
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,000
gives and quantum computing takes away

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,850
on the one hand there's the possibility

5
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,640
of breaking kind of all factor based

6
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,340
encryption technologies but on the other

7
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,820
hand there's the promise of uneven

8
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,970
communication through entangled photons

9
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,399
our next speaker wants to break these I

10
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:31,270
mean test the security of these systems

11
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,880
using high-powered lasers and fancy

12
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,460
super well rigged telescopes along the

13
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,070
way you'll hear stories of tons of

14
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,429
broken fiber optic cable please join me

15
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:44,929
in welcoming to the hackaday super

16
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:53,750
conference stage dr. Sara Keyser good

17
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,240
morning everyone I am so excited to be

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,340
here and share share with you some of

19
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,239
the work that I did actually for my PhD

20
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,560
which did involve lots of high powered

21
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,300
lasers so I know there's stereotypes of

22
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,280
like crazy cat ladies I feel like I'm

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,080
I'd like to make a new one for crazy

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,739
laser ladies so my background is an

25
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,690
experimental quantum optics and now I

26
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,099
work as a research engineer for

27
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,480
engineering consulting firm called

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,239
pensar development in Seattle and in my

29
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:26,950
spare time I do a lot of writing

30
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,000
specifically trying to take technical

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,270
topics and break them down for a variety

32
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,340
of age groups so everything from babies

33
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,040
to to my colleagues so but the really

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,170
the story of the technology we want to

35
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,650
talk about today is quantum technology

36
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,450
we saw in the last talk a lot of really

37
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,340
amazing examples of hardware side

38
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,030
channels for classical technology but

39
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,410
quantum technology is kind of the next

40
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,650
next big thing

41
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,030
mostly you've probably heard of quantum

42
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,730
computers but there's really lots of

43
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,840
different things you can do with this

44
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,740
technology you can make better

45
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,130
censors you can even improve information

46
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,990
security

47
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,800
so as the introduction alluded to

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,070
quantum computers can give and take one

49
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,540
of the most interesting things we

50
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,400
figured out how to do it or one of the

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,690
most interesting algorithms we've

52
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,920
figured out that we could do with them

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,740
allows us to factor factor large numbers

54
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,660
which is kind of a problem when a lot of

55
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,880
our cryptographic infrastructure assumes

56
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,430
that factoring large numbers is a

57
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,030
difficult thing for computers but on the

58
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,560
other hand we can use the same

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,380
technology and actually make our

60
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,260
cryptographic infrastructure better we

61
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,420
can't necessarily replace all of it but

62
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,710
what we're going to specifically focus

63
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,440
on here is the key exchange part of

64
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,300
cryptographic protocols

65
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,840
so there's encryption there's

66
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,830
certification lots of other things that

67
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,810
you can do but usually they all start

68
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,500
with sharing a secret with another party

69
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,480
so how do we actually go about doing

70
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,570
this also fun fact that's a real picture

71
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,130
from one of the setups we had to do

72
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,320
outside it was very demoralizing that

73
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,120
the only clearing and the trees was also

74
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,860
right in front of this very good I'm

75
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,760
gonna say just really like the first

76
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,350
year of your PhD it's like this is not

77
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,610
not good not good signaling so quantum

78
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,680
key distribution our objective here is

79
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,840
to share a key between two parties

80
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,980
canonically called

81
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,050
Alice and Bob but insert your favorite

82
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,860
characters here we need two things to do

83
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,320
this one a quantum channel between Alice

84
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,810
and Bob which in real life is basically

85
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,480
an optical fiber or as you saw with the

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,880
telescopes free space but the commercial

87
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,290
devices we'll be looking at here are

88
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,450
optically or connected with optical

89
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,910
fiber and the quantum systems you'll be

90
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,090
using are single photons so turns out

91
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,370
that when you kind of subdivide light

92
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,130
down to its smallest part the energy in

93
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,440
a single photon is so small that it

94
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,970
behaves according to quantum mechanics

95
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,790
as opposed to well regular mechanics so

96
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,860
you also need sorry the other thing we

97
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,510
need for this protocol is a classical

98
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,760
link between Alice and Bob this does not

99
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,240
need to be hidden or secret

100
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,090
it does have to be authenticated so you

101
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,229
can you can use the internet you can

102
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:23,120
text doesn't really matter they just

103
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,800
need a way of coordinating as a part of

104
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,630
the protocol at some point so what we're

105
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,400
gonna focus on though for the side

106
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,110
channel that we'll be exploiting for

107
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,150
this this protocol is the quantum part

108
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,699
because as we saw with the Sammis talked

109
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,919
previously there's lots of good ways to

110
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,800
deal with the classical link here so

111
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,210
what we want to actually look at is what

112
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,800
is new about these quantum crypto

113
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,060
devices which is the quantum link so

114
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,310
with all of this you might say alright

115
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,780
well we already have the classical link

116
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,669
here why are we even bothering with the

117
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,229
quantum part like I've just said it's

118
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:01,699
better well what you're able to attest

119
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,830
with a quantum key distribution system

120
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,509
over any other classical key

121
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,539
distribution method is provable security

122
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:11,150
so normally when you try to write a

123
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,800
security proof for your protocol you

124
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,870
have to make assumptions about what the

125
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,110
what attackers can do to your system or

126
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,360
to your parties while you're doing the

127
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,750
exchange so whether that's like how much

128
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,120
time they have or what computing

129
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,449
resources they have available but with

130
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,310
quantum key distribution all you have to

131
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,509
assume is that they're bound by the

132
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,130
speed of light and the laws of physics

133
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,469
which generally speaking if your

134
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:38,810
attacker is not bound by those things we

135
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,349
have a much bigger problem and security

136
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:45,740
doesn't matter at that point so yeah I

137
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,300
have some resources here at the bottom

138
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,969
if you want to learn more about qkd in

139
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,590
general we're gonna focus on a specific

140
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,419
protocol so there's lots of different

141
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:55,880
you know kind of like anything without a

142
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,259
standard yet there are lots of different

143
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,509
ways you can implement it kind of like

144
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,370
risk 5 before risk 5 and so here we'll

145
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,960
be looking at one specifically called BB

146
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,060
84 that part doesn't really matter so

147
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,750
much but what are the actual steps for

148
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,550
this quantum channel between Alice and

149
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,940
Bob so the first step is alice is going

150
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,729
to prepare her photons in one of four

151
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:22,880
random States it is important that these

152
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,099
are chosen randomly so she actually will

153
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:26,630
also have a quantum random numbers

154
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,530
generator in her device and I you can

155
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,210
see these depicted here as like top

156
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,240
bottom left and right this is just an

157
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,580
easier way to draw things but for the

158
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,230
actual photons there's different degrees

159
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,000
of freedom that you could use so you

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,980
could do this different settings for the

161
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,330
color of the photon you could do

162
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,520
different phases for the photons you can

163
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,070
do different polarization angles there

164
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,690
are lots of different systems we'll use

165
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,610
different degrees of freedom but we can

166
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,990
generalize and just say four different

167
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,630
settings so she'll send a string of

168
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,410
these randomly selected settings photons

169
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,950
to Bob and then Bob can choose one of

170
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,040
two measurement settings for on his side

171
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,140
so he can't actually distinguish all

172
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,910
four of these perfectly so he has to

173
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,140
choose basically whether he's going to

174
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,180
measure the top bottom setting or the

175
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,140
left/right setting and he's also because

176
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,610
he doesn't know ahead of time what

177
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,440
setting alice is sending because that's

178
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,760
kind of like the whole point that's the

179
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,180
key so he's also gonna choose random

180
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,760
link and what that means is so if

181
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,580
they're both choosing at random it's a

182
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,360
little bit hard to see here but the

183
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,880
about 50% of the time his measurement

184
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,010
setting will match up correctly with

185
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,810
what Alice sent and he will actually be

186
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,950
able to measure a correct bit as to how

187
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,870
they sort this out like that's what you

188
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,490
do on that classical public Channel

189
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,220
after you've exchanged all the photons

190
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,810
that part is way less interesting to me

191
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,530
because it doesn't involve lasers so

192
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,090
there's definitely you can read more

193
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,950
about this about the post-processing

194
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,090
later but let's focus on how these

195
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,620
photons are actually getting from Alice

196
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,420
to Bob because that this channel between

197
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,190
the two is basically all we have access

198
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,080
to for the side Channel I'm assuming

199
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,700
that they have implemented their

200
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,650
physical security well enough that I

201
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,390
can't just walk into their lab and set

202
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,620
something on the table next to it so

203
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,910
what's really cool is there's actually

204
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,560
already devices that do this that you

205
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,840
can buy commercially so here's an

206
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,550
example from a company called ID quant

207
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,930
ich so you see two boxes here one that's

208
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,900
basically one is Alice and one is Bob

209
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,180
they're connected by optical fiber both

210
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,950
for the quantum channel and also for the

211
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,529
classical communication channel the

212
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,060
boxes on top this company actually sells

213
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,279
the best classical encryption systems

214
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,350
with it so that you can XOR the key from

215
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,089
both the quantum part and the classical

216
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:58,150
part to give you an even stronger key so

217
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,240
it's a good marketing tactic for them so

218
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,250
but what's inside this these boxes

219
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,020
because we want to find a side channel

220
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,130
we do like we don't assume that we can't

221
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,350
reverse engineer what's inside so we

222
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,740
took one we opened it up and you can see

223
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,980
our familiar boxes here Alice and Bob

224
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,930
and lots of different types of optical

225
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,500
components here variable attenuators

226
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,040
photo detectors laser diodes all of this

227
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,800
is at their just standard telecom parts

228
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,480
there's not even anything fancy about

229
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,110
this it's just 1550 nanometers the one

230
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,820
thing that you might note is interesting

231
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,960
here is Alice doesn't have a light

232
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,529
source so for their particular

233
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,300
implementation what happens is Bob has a

234
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,650
laser aha also do I have a laser I have

235
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,110
a laser so Bob actually has the laser

236
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,550
and he can

237
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,580
he sends really bright pulses to Alice

238
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,980
so many many photons at once and Alice

239
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,990
actually just reflects that back and

240
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,930
uses this attenuator here to attenuate

241
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,779
it down to a single photon level as well

242
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:07,150
as use this phase modulator here to

243
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,800
encode which of those four settings

244
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,890
she's picking so that's it's kind of a

245
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,720
weird thing and they have technical

246
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,830
reasons why they did this but

247
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,410
conceptually it's the same as the

248
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,209
diagrams we're looking at before allit

249
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,610
the information is not imparted onto the

250
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:27,720
photon until alice reflects it back cool

251
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,970
so how do we actually exploit this side

252
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,450
Channel

253
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,370
unfortunately provable security like

254
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,800
like everything that nothing actually

255
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,140
matches our model and there's always

256
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,760
ways in which the hardware once we

257
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,000
implement it you know isn't isn't fully

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,640
captured in our security proofs so one

259
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,020
of my favorite examples of a side

260
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,959
Channel

261
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,879
for this was actually one of the first

262
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,569
qkd devices implemented in Bell Labs at

263
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:59,749
IBM in the early 90s you could hear what

264
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:02,059
settings Alice was choosing for her

265
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:04,850
photons just because the rotation stages

266
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,220
that were rotating components so like

267
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,649
Alice Alice was here on this end Bob was

268
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:12,290
here on this end and all the components

269
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,300
here rotated and you could just listen

270
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,660
for the key so I mean obviously their

271
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,129
intent here was not they were not

272
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:21,379
designing for security but it's a really

273
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:24,410
I think funny example of a side channel

274
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,149
we got a lot more also from semi-tight

275
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:30,470
Sammis talked earlier so similarly when

276
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,790
I started working on this problem there

277
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,139
were a number of known attacks already

278
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:37,670
things that might sound very familiar

279
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,879
timing attacks multiple wavelength

280
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,379
attacks so basically you have a

281
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,269
particular wavelength or color that the

282
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:46,699
system is operating at if you inject in

283
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,369
at a similar but not quite the same

284
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,429
wavelength you can get your light

285
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:54,800
encoded at the same time it will reflect

286
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,290
back out and then you can separate it on

287
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,939
the line in between and then you can

288
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:00,949
basically just read out what Alice or

289
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:05,389
Bob is doing but kind of the attack that

290
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:07,670
we were inspired by was a detector

291
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,939
control attack so how this worked was

292
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:14,149
actually found by accident but basically

293
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:17,689
if you shine a low-power laser light at

294
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:19,819
Bob's detector systems so at his kind of

295
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:23,179
his to measurement settings and then

296
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:26,929
pulse selectively on top of that you can

297
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:29,029
basically make him detect whatever you

298
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:33,050
like and what that it leaves it readily

299
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,439
open for like a man-in-the-middle attack

300
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,850
so you could then just sit pretend

301
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,829
you're Bob make your measurements and

302
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:41,240
then make the real Bob have the same

303
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,790
measurements that you just made normally

304
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,549
this wouldn't be possible because one of

305
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:49,459
the parts of the reason why you'd use

306
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:51,889
quantum systems for this is called the

307
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:54,679
no cloning print property so you can't

308
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:57,529
arbitrarily copy a random quantum system

309
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,149
so that's kind of what ensures the

310
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:01,129
security of your of your quantum systems

311
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:03,999
going between the two

312
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,529
because all of these tacks were already

313
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:08,540
known they of course attempted counter

314
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,270
measures to these so what we wanted to

315
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,700
do was actually say all right what are

316
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,560
these counter measures enough can we

317
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,720
kind of like the last thing Sammy also

318
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,770
talked about of just putting the

319
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,410
capacitor across can you just disable

320
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,170
them so here's the same diagram that we

321
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,420
were looking at before but now I've put

322
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,960
in what actually they did to act as a

323
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,400
countermeasure to a lot of those attacks

324
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,339
which is basically to put some

325
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,560
monitoring photodiodes watching the

326
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,610
incoming light to Alice so basically in

327
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,320
this area here and what's interesting to

328
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,990
note about this is 90% of the incoming

329
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,020
light and Alice goes into this system so

330
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,720
that kind of made us start thinking

331
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,620
maybe we should get the lasers so if 90%

332
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,750
of the light is into the system is going

333
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,810
into this monitoring section if we had a

334
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,300
high enough powered laser maybe we could

335
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,390
melt that system or disable it in some

336
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,260
way and actually leave the rest of the

337
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,010
system intact so that was basically what

338
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,720
we set out to do so the first thing we

339
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,640
had to do was actually take all of those

340
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,920
components in those boxes that the light

341
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,720
was going to interact with and figure

342
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,550
out what their actual power damage

343
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,770
threshold was because there's always the

344
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,390
datasheet and then you know that's

345
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,279
probably three times you know either

346
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,839
lower or higher than what they think it

347
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,550
actually can handle but what can it

348
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,630
really handle then if that came out

349
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,950
successful then we wanted to actually

350
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,680
look at those series of three photo

351
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,779
diodes which have a variety of different

352
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,750
kind of readout electronics behind them

353
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,800
looking for different properties of the

354
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,500
incoming signal if we so what we wanted

355
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,930
to do was can we craft a laser pulse

356
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,540
that will disable the right combination

357
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,720
of them so that it doesn't raise alarms

358
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,490
and if both of those work figure out

359
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,200
what you know Goldilocks setting

360
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,110
Goldilocks setting for our attack laser

361
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,850
we could use to actually disable the

362
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,320
system and then try a full attack so

363
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,200
fortunately lab equipment is very judgy

364
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,570
this is a fibrous placer which I did

365
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,130
have to use a lot

366
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,900
so some of the components that we

367
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,060
actually had to test so if we're gonna

368
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,010
get this laser power in there the parts

369
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,000
before the detectors better not break so

370
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,100
we have things like the actual fiber

371
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,340
itself the connectors you can see I'm

372
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,990
wearing some of the kind of like a

373
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,180
hunter puts puts their trophy somewhere

374
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,810
I'm wearing a bunch of them splitters

375
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,420
attenuators and what we actually long

376
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,460
story short what we found was we

377
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,250
couldn't break them like we took I

378
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,380
wouldn't took all of our lab equipment

379
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,430
to a lab that had a 75 watt freespace CW

380
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,330
laser at 1550 which just for context

381
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,610
like most laser pointers are five

382
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,360
milliwatts so this is 75 Watts we had a

383
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,859
really hard time coupling this labor

384
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,709
laser into fiber because as you focused

385
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,990
it down the air was heating up so much

386
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,790
that the end of the fiber was vibrating

387
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,010
and we couldn't actually get the power

388
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,839
into the fiber so with however much

389
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,099
power we were able to get in there and

390
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,369
none of these components broke which was

391
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,310
a little disappointing to me so we

392
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,660
obviously tried to push it farther and

393
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,800
discovered an interesting new effect

394
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,360
that we definitely did not want to

395
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,390
trigger as a part of this so you can see

396
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,920
here we're taking the raw end of a fiber

397
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,430
rubbing it on the table and starting

398
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,390
this really cool glowy bit which is

399
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,910
called a fiber fuse so kind of like you

400
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,680
know you leave a gunpowder trail along

401
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,430
the ground this fuse is a plasma fire in

402
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,950
the glass that propagates back towards

403
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,260
the laser source itself to me and it

404
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,670
seems counterintuitive because the laser

405
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,440
is going forward but it's actually

406
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,000
consuming the energy back towards the

407
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,540
laser source and one of the neat things

408
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,480
that also neat and also very bad things

409
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,250
that happens as a function of this of is

410
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,280
so here's an just a microscope picture

411
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,630
of an optical fiber

412
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,780
after that fuse goes by you get all of

413
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,210
these really amazing little perfectly

414
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,450
periodic bubbles and the periodicity of

415
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,130
these bubbles or the spacing is

416
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,950
basically is directly proportional to

417
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,330
proportional

418
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,940
- how much energy over the threshold you

419
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,800
were to start the plasma fire at that

420
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,980
location so you can see here it actually

421
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,310
varies a little bit more in just a

422
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,880
little different place in the fiber so I

423
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,590
was very happy we met how we broke a lot

424
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,490
of fiber this way

425
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,740
but it is entirely unusable after this

426
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,570
like the loss induced by these bubbles

427
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,420
in the core is just so as a part of our

428
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,920
attack we definitely didn't want this to

429
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,390
happen but we totally wanted this to

430
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,170
happen some of the times so that was

431
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,550
good on to step two we have a so we

432
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,410
wanted to test these diodes so we just

433
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,580
set up a little kind of characterization

434
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,540
rig here where we have a characterizing

435
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,700
laser that would kind of stimulate it in

436
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,650
the same way that the regular system

437
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,380
would we set up a damaging laser and

438
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,520
basically we'd alternate we'd

439
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,710
characterize it to start with we damaged

440
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,450
it and then characterized it again to

441
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,520
see what actually happened and we

442
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,140
iterated through many many different

443
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,210
combinations of like continuous laser

444
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,390
light do we pulse it do we like ramp up

445
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,710
slowly so to show you kind of some of

446
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,610
the best results from that here is a new

447
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,500
detector a pin so it's just a pin

448
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,200
photodiode you can see the two pins the

449
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,820
sensor itself and the little gold

450
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,850
bonding wire after one of our more

451
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,470
successful attacks you can see this

452
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,410
puddle and it's kind of hard to see but

453
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,870
the bonding wire is entirely off and

454
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,700
disconnected so this failed in an open

455
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,930
circuit fashion which was ideal for us

456
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,640
looking a little bit closer at this you

457
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,680
can see this is like top down on the

458
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,100
sensor here we are actually with kind of

459
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,520
a I think this was pulsed laser light at

460
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,830
a lot kind of a lower power we were able

461
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,780
to actually decrease the sensitivity of

462
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,280
the photodiode so actually it's still

463
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,780
operated but we could reduce its

464
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,960
sensitivity by like 15 to 25 percent

465
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,900
which will be important or we can cause

466
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,340
catastrophic damage and hope that so the

467
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,660
picture you saw before it failed in an

468
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,340
open circuit way we also had some where

469
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,440
they fused in a closed circuit that was

470
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,690
less helpful and it's just kind of

471
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,180
statistical weather which of those two

472
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,690
cases happened

473
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,180
but I think from this that'll work so

474
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,980
what conditions did we actually want to

475
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,000
try and attack on here we could we could

476
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,410
try to go for the full key which is

477
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,390
fully disabling this monitoring system

478
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,850
but we have this kind of statistical

479
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,590
chance of is it going to fail open or

480
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,540
close

481
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,140
so we obviously took that option but in

482
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,520
a more realistic sense you could also

483
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,100
try to go for partial key where you just

484
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,870
reduce the sensitivity of that sensor

485
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,540
and that allows you to inject some of

486
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,430
your own light in again and that opens

487
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,110
up like kind of a Trojan horse style

488
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,120
attack or the multi multi wavelength

489
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,540
attack so we actually tried this on our

490
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,760
running system so all of the testing

491
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,350
prior to this was on copies of

492
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,120
components outside the boxes because

493
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,200
that was like a half-million-dollar

494
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,620
system I was not about to put optical

495
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,170
power in and potentially risk all of my

496
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,170
PhD results so this was a very very

497
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,330
anxious time but you can see here we've

498
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:46,720
got so here's time of the attack and

499
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,240
orange line here is basically the key

500
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,520
that's in the buffer of the system so it

501
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,760
goes up in steps because each time you

502
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,280
get to the end of the key distillation

503
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,110
phase or that's basically the classical

504
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,750
communication they do afterwards they

505
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,400
figure out what what key they actually

506
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,460
got from that and added to the buffer so

507
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,220
you can see the system started up it did

508
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,610
some calibration got some key here's

509
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,090
where we launched our attack and then

510
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,980
you can see it actually just continued

511
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,080
on its merry way and kept accumulating

512
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,880
key into the buffer if it had actually

513
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,940
failed and raised an alarm the orange

514
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,990
line would have gone to zero because it

515
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,190
would have dumped the buffer and it

516
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,930
would have just sat there and like a wee

517
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,630
wee woo wee woo motor until someone came

518
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:36,190
in and reset it so yeah it was entirely

519
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,880
successful so what what what did we

520
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,500
learn from this

521
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,320
I learned that brute force is sometimes

522
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,230
the best force no everyone I talked to

523
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,730
about this like at conferences and stuff

524
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,930
when we were working on this they were

525
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,550
like this is a really dumb idea like

526
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,200
obviously you're gonna break something

527
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,720
else before the stuff you want to break

528
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,200
brakes and I was like oh maybe we should

529
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,049
just try it and it's a testament to the

530
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,549
engineering of all the other components

531
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,379
in these boxes that were just so well

532
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:06,940
engineered that they actually survived

533
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,110
this

534
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,919
so brute force is the best force these

535
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,049
physical side channels can compromise

536
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:18,610
even the best security and yeah that

537
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,129
it's nice to have provable security but

538
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:23,019
really and really these are always going

539
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:24,850
to be implemented with real hardware and

540
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,500
we really need like a validation you

541
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,179
know basically quantum key distribution

542
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:30,100
is now at a stage where we kind of need

543
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,039
to adopt some standards and validation

544
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,200
labs to actually move forward which

545
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,809
leads into the last bit quantum hardware

546
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:39,669
and software and needs your guys's

547
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,850
expertise speaking like coming from the

548
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,679
physics side where we actually like a

549
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:46,120
lot of these devices have spent most of

550
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,090
their life just like myself in a lab

551
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,320
they're not necessarily ready for the

552
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,860
real world yet and especially in a lot

553
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,100
of the designing of the electronics and

554
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,570
in the software and the and the firmware

555
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,820
and FPGAs for like it's a really

556
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,919
exciting area and I encourage you to get

557
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:06,850
interested talk to me more later today

558
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,700
or on Twitter if you want to learn more

559
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,379
but I'm always excited to talk about

560
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:15,950
this and melt things with lasers thanks

561
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:23,950
[Applause]
