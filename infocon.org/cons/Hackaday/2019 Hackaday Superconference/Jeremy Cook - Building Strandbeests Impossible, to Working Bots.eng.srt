3
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,100
all right everybody ready to go was that

4
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,640
very sleepy from after lunch I can't

5
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,400
hear you all right

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,230
all right so our next speaker is a

7
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,470
writer who contributes to the tindy blog

8
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,120
popular science hackaday among others

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,660
and in his spare time he embraces his

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,960
inner maker by posting videos to YouTube

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,930
about his latest project he today he's

12
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,649
here to take us through his this guy his

13
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:07,710
little personal strand beast so please

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,600
welcome to the heck at a stage

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,920
Jeremy cook well thanks so much for that

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,500
intro Brian I guess I'll let my strand

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,729
beasts I called the clear crawler

18
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:47,009
introduce it to itself all right so

19
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,380
there's my little clear crawler just

20
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,630
crawling around on the garage floor my

21
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,200
garage

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,209
it's 15 a half inches in high about 150

23
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,729
rpm motors various things like that

24
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:06,000
controlled by Nanna off 24 l01 remote

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,389
control and lots and lots of bearings

26
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:15,270
lots of gears so

27
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,380
so that being Selma going through how I

28
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,620
made this

29
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,560
all right there we go so my talk is

30
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,480
called stron beasts from impossible bill

31
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,640
to dominating in my garage and these

32
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,099
these beasts have been in my garage for

33
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,230
probably six years or so went from kind

34
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,890
of a kind of a project that I thought I

35
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,560
would never be able to do to something

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,720
that well I've made at least six of them

37
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,879
at this point so you know as far as

38
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,370
media like Brian said I'm engineer

39
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,500
experimenter technical writer somebody

40
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,510
who has a kind of a hard time telling

41
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,890
people what I do when they ask me

42
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,959
feature in a hackaday and I've written

43
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,390
there as well and most importantly for

44
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,200
year I love making things the first

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,730
first step in this was I got inspired

46
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,280
somebody sent me a video of a guy named

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,010
Jo Johnson which he made this incredible

48
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,870
strand bisa talked around on the beach

49
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,359
and I just thought you know I saw that I

50
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:43,150
thought well you know I can I can maybe

51
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,310
maybe do something like that right I

52
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,780
thought basically I thought I'd never be

53
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,540
able to do someone like that and as I

54
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,970
thought about it more and more I decided

55
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,389
to just just make one one linkage one

56
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:57,819
leg and the way these work is that

57
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:01,299
you've got one one linkage on the on the

58
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:03,489
center that actually it's all these all

59
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,680
these legs through just linkages so if

60
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,750
you've got two two motors one on each

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,639
side you can drive it kind of like a

62
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:12,069
tank and what's shown here is is four

63
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:14,590
four legs and mine uses eight because

64
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,810
with four it just tends to to buckle

65
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,089
back and forth quite a bit it this it's

66
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,120
not really that smooth but um you know

67
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,470
like I said I tried it I thought well I

68
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,599
can make one one leg you know that

69
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,490
wasn't a big deal then I thought well I

70
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,320
could make a base for this and I could

71
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,330
make three more and then well like I

72
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,840
came to this and as you can see this is

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,550
almost the size of a golf court current

74
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,970
I never got this to quite work correctly

75
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,840
you know part of the reason I didn't

76
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,880
have pick enough motors on it lots of

77
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,190
friction and it just you know I was just

78
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,289
trying to do a precision instrument with

79
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:49,740
very imprecise tools which makes

80
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,750
tellenson his beast you know he made it

81
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,419
at a PVC pipe which I still don't know

82
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,190
how they did it I mean it seemed amazing

83
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,570
to begin with but now that I've built

84
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,360
several it just seems almost impossible

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,570
especially under wind power but this one

86
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:04,780
see

87
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,389
little bit too big and so you know what

88
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,100
did I do it and set it four legs I made

89
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,320
it with eight legs and here's me and uh

90
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,620
my my cousin trying to try it out and

91
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,080
push it across the the garage

92
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,120
it broke soon after this so it never

93
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,910
quite worked the way I wanted it's a cut

94
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,710
out of MDF and it's very very heavy yeah

95
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,180
and after that I decided to scale it

96
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,500
down made someone gonna call this the

97
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,050
stron - mouse this actually worked

98
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,710
pretty well it's got a a quadcopter as a

99
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,050
controller so you know as quad copters

100
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,820
are steel or seared differentially so

101
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,800
you can power all the motors up in the

102
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,400
same at the same amount and it'll go

103
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,440
forwards but if you change how much

104
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,750
you're you're giving to each motor that

105
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,640
thing will steer like a tank and this

106
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,370
did work for for a while until it fell

107
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,470
apart everything was it was kind of kind

108
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,840
of glued together so this is you know

109
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,970
the other two are too big this is maybe

110
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,740
a little bit too small and then after

111
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,350
that I made one that was just right and

112
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,720
this one to this day it'll still work

113
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,840
it's got a great linkage system the

114
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,180
middle it's got gears so all that torque

115
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,550
is transmitted down a central shaft

116
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,850
rather than using like a camshaft

117
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,560
mechanism like like Talos and got to

118
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,419
give a shout-out to a Joe who goes up a

119
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,580
hobby engineer he he I think he's the

120
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,460
one that came up with this central shaft

121
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,510
mechanism really really good design and

122
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,890
after that I decided to scale it up

123
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,390
again made something out of clear

124
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,669
polycarbonate called this one the clear

125
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:39,910
Walker really beautiful never got it to

126
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,710
work quite as well as as tailee onsen

127
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,729
would you know as his beast but then I

128
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:47,200
tried to actually make a kit this one

129
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,479
rot launches rockets which was that was

130
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:52,330
a lot of fun and then finally I came to

131
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,180
at the clear crawler this one

132
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,460
somebody geek mom project she came up

133
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,750
with the name for this I asked about

134
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,500
that on Twitter and shout-out to her too

135
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,590
but this one is clear polycarbonate so

136
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,810
it looks has the same look as it big bit

137
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,810
clear Walker but it's you know small

138
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,039
enough that I can get it to walk around

139
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:14,530
really well which I'll demonstrate in

140
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,740
just a minute

141
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,140
not since

142
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,300
learned through this whole process you

143
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,160
know bigger isn't always better

144
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,110
Big Brother cut off switch which I'll

145
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,540
show that a little later is awesome I

146
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,020
had a couple of those lying around and I

147
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,280
made that a big priority than this

148
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,160
design which is maybe a little bit

149
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,350
superfluous I guess but it was really

150
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,220
fun

151
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,920
differential steering not just for tanks

152
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,200
and then barians bearings bearings

153
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,240
bearings bearings you need all kinds of

154
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,530
bearings for something like this just

155
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,020
the the torque the the friction just

156
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,780
adds up just astronomically after a

157
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,000
while so this whole thing it's got 88

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,380
thrust bearings 11 per leg and it could

159
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,730
be a kid even you some other bearings I

160
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,720
mean you could probably put twice as

161
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,790
many bearings on it make it even better

162
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,040
if you want to do you know controls wise

163
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,750
it's very simple it's just two motors

164
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,240
one goes for the other goes forward or

165
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,690
whatever and yeah so that's not so toes

166
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,460
there's that big red switch I was

167
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,400
talking about really love that and it's

168
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,530
functional too because you turn it on

169
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,320
and the the driving motors can go and he

170
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,480
turn it off and everything else is on

171
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,670
but the driving motors there's no power

172
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,590
to them so you can diagnose stuff

173
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,210
without having to worry about it

174
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,670
crawling off the table on you and if it

175
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,590
does crawl away you can you flip it off

176
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,860
so that's that's nice there's the

177
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,450
differential control method you've got

178
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,600
the one one motor on the left side one

179
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,700
on the right you know just like a tank

180
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,010
both goes both go forward it goes

181
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,680
forward both back both back or then some

182
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,420
combination will go left and left and

183
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,940
right there's another picture of the one

184
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,330
of the the leg linkages that's it's

185
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,790
basically acting as a central rotation

186
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,400
there so you've got four of these per

187
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,160
side and then four legs just going going

188
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,710
on and on yeah I think the clear

189
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,900
polycarbonate really really shows it off

190
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,400
nicely and this is all cut on a CNC

191
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,640
router designed in the CAD system like

192
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,980
like AutoCAD oh I guess I'd knock off on

193
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,270
okay you call it yeah 11 thrusts barians

194
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,850
there's another shot of that and yeah

195
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,620
now it's time for the other demo so

196
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,580
let's check it out

197
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,980
so you can see there one thing I've got

198
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,510
I've got to pivot on it goes left and

199
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,730
right down up and down and then it's got

200
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,700
a little little um beeper on it - what

201
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,220
you I guess you can hear it so yeah and

202
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,130
then if I press forward on the control

203
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,790
goes forward backwards and then I can do

204
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,950
right left and then let's see if it if

205
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,410
it goes forward too fast it has a hard

206
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,910
time because the legs tend to jam up a

207
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,950
little bit so let's see if I can get it

208
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,350
to not walk off the table there we go so

209
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,190
yep there it goes

210
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,529
yeah it almost did that you know I get

211
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:26,790
asked the question sometimes is this

212
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,010
good off-road and it's it's very much

213
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,050
not it can simulate a wheel pretty well

214
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,270
because the linkage system is designed

215
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,570
in such a way that each each foot will

216
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,660
travel up and then go just down flat for

217
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,150
a while so I've found that for four legs

218
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,640
in each side will simulate I guess two

219
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,860
wheels just like a car pretty pretty

220
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,120
well but one is not enough and three I

221
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,190
haven't tried because that's just you

222
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,380
know the work just adds up master anomic

223
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,830
lee after a while so yeah I guess do you

224
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,420
guys have any questions about how I made

225
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,480
this or anything about the design

226
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:11,870
anything I can answer yes or yes

227
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:20,410
let's see it's kind of the unauthorized

228
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,319
collaboration okay so so he he came up

229
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:25,209
with the linkage lengths for each of the

230
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:27,309
legs like like that's entirely his

231
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:29,709
design although I guess I did maybe make

232
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,139
a few modifications but he's you know I

233
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,209
give him all the credit for that the

234
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,240
where I kind of came in was making the

235
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,249
actual design on cat and adapting into a

236
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:40,959
motorized system rather than a

237
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,379
wind-powered device so yeah that's the I

238
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,579
guess that's the extent of our

239
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,160
collaboration so there's another

240
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,209
question over so polycarbonate the legs

241
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:54,850
themselves they're made the quarter-inch

242
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,279
for the main parts of the legs and then

243
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,139
some of the supporting members you know

244
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:02,860
the the part on the top like right right

245
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,619
there that just kind of first strut kind

246
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:08,709
of to support the electronics that's a

247
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:12,129
of an inch and then the the larger gears

248
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:15,189
I believe that's just under half an inch

249
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:17,499
I made these pretty large so that the

250
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:20,529
the gears on the the driving gears

251
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:23,470
wouldn't kind of fall off if that makes

252
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,600
any sense I I tried that before in fact

253
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,360
on the bigger clearer Walker they didn't

254
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,589
have that problem my name later would

255
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:31,509
just kind of if the gears in and mess

256
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:34,300
just correctly they'd kind of fall off

257
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,809
of each other so yeah so that was that's

258
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:41,160
answer that yes

259
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,690
sure I mean I'd say the biggest thing on

260
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,280
this the question was how did friction

261
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,200
design our patter friction affect my

262
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,810
design choices I'd say the biggest thing

263
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,030
was just adding bearings after bearing

264
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,020
after burying it it um yeah I mean that

265
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,970
you know that adds up price-wise for

266
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,490
after a while when I made it out of MDF

267
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,280
I actually put some carbon powder on

268
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,860
some of the gears which which helped it

269
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,750
help to reduce friction on that I could

270
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,760
probably use that on this too but so far

271
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,580
it's yet to be yet to be necessary then

272
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,310
I guess I the more friction I can redo

273
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,840
this the smaller motors that can use to

274
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,800
so faster would go I guess yeah anything

275
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,880
else I can answer so yeah well thanks so

276
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,070
much for watching hope you hope you

277
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,870
enjoy the presentation

278
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,070
[Applause]
